hardofhearing,Did getting hearing aids change how social you are?,"Before I got my hearing aids, I didn’t realize how much I avoided having conversations.
I’d smile, nod, and hope I was responding at the right time but inside I was always
anxious I’d misheard something. Over time, I stopped joining group chats or going to
noisy places because it just felt exhausting trying to keep up.

After getting my hearing aids, I was able to follow along without guessing. This has
honestly changed how social I am, I feel more confident speaking up or even just
hanging out without worrying I’ll miss half the conversation.

Hearing aides don't work for me, but with learning ASL and visiting Deaf spaces I've had a similar experience. I'm enjoying the company of other people for the first time and having a blast!

Hearing aids do more to improve my quality of life than any other health remedy or appliance! No clueless smiling-and-nodding. No failure to engage go fear of misunderstanding or social faux pas. Renewed satisfaction in being a real-time interactive part of family gatherings and intimate moments.

Yes. HAs helped me reenter life!

Pretty much everything! Conversations that would get skipped due to fear of non-hearing started happening, brought a lot of extroversion too.

No, not really I think. Although I’m much more responsive instead of saying “what?” or “huh?” all the time or not even responding at all",2025-11-15 05:04:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxj2qv/did_getting_hearing_aids_change_how_social_you_are/

hardofhearing,Low self esteem? Low confidence? Does this make me unlikable?,"Basically the title.

I’ve struggled with this for most of my life, for some background info, I’m a woman and almost 40 and have a hearing loss. I am well educated and hold a job and own my own home. 

I find it hard to make friends that take me seriously or don’t seem to comprehend that I have understanding of human depth and conversations. I am socially awkward due to my hearing loss and have missed a lot on social cues growing up. I have some friends and good ones but the ones I am unsure about, they seem to be surface level friends- not meeting me halfway or understanding me or making an effort. (Don’t get me wrong, with my hearing devices I hear perfectly clear and communicate just fine) but they seem more surface level and just meh. I feel like sometimes I’m a filler friend like an option if no one else is around. Are these people just fake acquaintances? I have a hard time reading social cues as well.

I am currently in therapy figuring out my shit- working on being healthier and making healthier choices and learning my own self worth. But it only seems to solve my problems as it is on my own, but hasn’t seemed to improve my social life. Does anyone have any tips to just let this go and focus on oneself?

Sorry if this all sounds like a midlife crisis- but I’m so tired. 😪

If anyone has any motivating advice or inspiration, please send them my way. 🤟🏼

I'm 57. I've been wearing aids since I was 23. For the longest time I had only hearing friends, which is good. Some understand better than others, that's for sure. When my hearing dropped the last time, two hearing friends didn't fully understand my new communication issues and I had to let it all go and that was hard. I don't know if you have any local hearing loss support groups but that's helped me in the end. They validate my experiences. 

I've been talking about confidence and self-esteem the last week or so on other social media. If you're on LinkedIn, my posts is open to anyone (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelle-wyatt-a410b7233/). It is hard to have confidence with hearing loss, doubting whether or not we heard right or not. Plus people have so many misconceptions about hearing loss. That's the part I'm always correcting.

Hi. 

You took a page from my diary, typed it and called it your own! 🤭🙃🥰🫣 

You are far from alone. 

(I write this while sitting in my car after hiking, watching the sun set. Alone. )

If you’d like to talk/txt/be pen pals, please reach out. I’ve found that the more I talk with those who have walked the path similar to mine, the more we understand each other. I went through my entire life thinking I was broken; I didn’t know anyone else like me. I was living in a very small town, my parents had the best intentions but they kept me isolated (severely) and I never got the chance to go out into the real world until I was in my 30’s. It was…SHOCKING. 

It still is. 

I’m now 44. I have went from hearing aides to a Cochlear Implant, which was the best thing I have ever done in my life. I have been a Cochlear mentor for about 3 years; I went from being the person who viewed my hearing loss as my deepest darkest secret. I hid it at all costs; it was the shame that undid me. Now? I’m proud of my path. I’m one of the, if not the biggest advocates for @CochlearAmerica 
I tell everyone the truth about life with hearing loss, deadness, and how it affects not only you but everyone else around you. Hearing loss is a one way street, fast track to early onset of dementia. Cochlear gave me a chance to learn how to live AGAIN. This time? I hear so much that I have never heard before. 
Fortunately/Unfortunately. 
Ha! 

Please, reach out. 
You are not alone. 
I’m here now and I’ll hear always. 💚👂",2025-11-14 19:44:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ox6g3s/low_self_esteem_low_confidence_does_this_make_me/
hardofhearing,How often do you end up charging your hearing aids during,"I’ve been thinking about upgrading soon, but I’m curious how people handle charging routines. I know most newer models are rechargeable now, but do they realistically last a full day with normal use, especially if you stream music or take calls through Bluetooth? Please let me know how your experience has been with rechargeable hearing aids.

[댓글]
battery life for mine (phonak) is the whole day, 9am-10pm give or take and i only charge them when i’m sleeping. on the plus side, if you forget to charge them overnight i find that charging them just for 20-30 minutes gets me through 5-6 hours. I’m constantly listening to music through them, and find it doesn’t affect the battery life. my last hearing aids (first of rechargeable/bluetooth model) lasted me a little more than 4 years until battery was basically gone

Yes, they absolutely last a full day. I've had mine for two years and they last for 14-16hrs even with heavy (like, 8-10 hours) of streaming. 

I've only had them die before I could put them in their charging case maybe... three or four times over the past two years? It's been great. 

But yeah... without streaming, I imagine they'd probably last two full days. They're absolutely not like iphones.

I work 12 hours shifts for work. I use batteries now but back when I had rechargeable I’d throw them in at 5am, and by 7-8pm they would be dying. So for me, did not last a full day. As a guy in his 30’s doing shift work I did not like the rechargeables and switched back to battery.

I've had Resound Quattros for at least 6 years now. I only recharge them at night. They're usually still at 75% battery when I put them on the charger.


I do maybe an hour total of streaming/calls each day.

Most HAs now will last for 30-50ish hours. I wear my Phonak sphere 90s from about 7am to midnight every day and they're usually at 60-70% battery still when I go to charge them. I stream a ton and use the sphere mode a ton. 

I had Oticon More 1s before those and I would typically get about 1.5 days of use out of them before needing to charge. It's a non-issue these days.

Only one time in three years have I ever had a low battery warning from my hearing aids. I must have been streaming very heavily that day.

Mine are 3 years old and still holding a full day charge. I *did* completely forget that I would need to charge them while we were flying overnight from the US to Iceland, so after landing, I had to charge them in the terminal while we waited for our shuttle.

I charge my Jabras every night

Mine can last several days without a charge. I try to charge it every other day if not every day

My last hearing aids were Kirkland brand and they were the first generation of rechargeable. The battery sucked. I have long days (6-11) and they would start to die between 3-6 pm depending on how much Bluetooth I used (usually a lot). 

My new hearing aids are ReSound. The battery is amazing. I can stream all day and they have tons of power left at night. Also the charging dock holds battery so if you can't plug into an outlet you can just set them in the case and they'll recharge quickly. However, their water resistance sucks (I had to get them fixed by the manufacturer after only 3 months due to a sweaty workout) and I've had a lot of issues with the Bluetooth. My next set will be Phonak and I'm never getting anything other than that.

Oticon Intent. On workdays I take them out of the charger at around 7 am, listen to music and podcasts, make calls all day. At 10 pm they are still at around 30 % charge. 

Age is about 1 year.

My Widex Moments last a full day, unless it's a heavy Bluetooth usage day.  I put them in the charger when I go to sleep around 10-ish and take them out of the charger when I wake up at 5....

I had to upgrade to a stronger hearing aid so now have battery powered but my old was a rechargeable phonak and lasted me one day easily. Sometimes two days since I never used the music or calls (couldn’t hear them clearly enough).

I have oticon HAs and wear them an average of 3/4 hours a day (I have sensory problems, and wearing them for a long time is too much). I usually only charge them once a week. To be fair, I do have a charging case and I just put them back in there each time instead of putting them in the regular case, so they're always at 100% each use, and the case holds about 3 full charges. They definitely last longer than my battery HAs did.

I've got Phonak rechargeables for a mild to profound bilateral loss, put them in around 7-8 am and they last me until 9/10 pm. use them for Bluetooth pretty consistently throughout the day (laptop, phone calls, music, etc). but I normally take them out by 4pm cuz I'm done hearing lol

Mine, Oticon Intent 4, last about 20 hours.

I charge mine at night and the charge lasts for the whole day. Every once in a while they disconnect from charging and I have to charge them. Rare tho",2025-11-14 17:32:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ox2x78/how_often_do_you_end_up_charging_your_hearing/

hardofhearing,Hearing parent with HOH child,"Hello all!

I am a mom of a newly diagnosed child (2F) with moderate hearing loss. She has a genetic condition called Marshalls Syndrome, that causes progressive hearing loss. We are working on getting hearing aids ordered and have seen all the medical professionals  (Audiology, ENT, etc).

We are already plugged in with TEIS (TN early intervention) and have seen a Social worker. My husband and I both work full time and She goes to daycare full time. 

  
Mainly I am posting because I have no idea what I am doing.  No one in my or my husbands family have gone through this process and we feel so alone. People in our circle are supportive, but they just don't understand as most of our friends don't even have kids, let alone one with a disability. 

  
Any insight would be helpful. Also, any recommendation for support groups or assistance would be appreciated as well. We are just lost and need guidance. &lt;3

[댓글]
Connecting with early intervention is a good thing. Encourage ASL and spoken english equally. Check out r/podc.

*hugs* 

You could see if there is an active hands &amp; voices program near you. 

Gallaudet has extension offices, not sure if there is one in TN, but if there is contact them. Shared Saturday Reading is an amazing experience. 

StartASL has ASL1 for free online.

I know it would be a big trip and investment if it were a good fit for your child, but our experience doing cochlear implants at Boston Children's was outstanding. We hesitated going through with it, and now that it's done we wish we had done it much earlier. 

I also recommend looking up wrights Law and getting their books. They are THE go to lawyers and advocates for special education. If they ever do an in person training near you I highly recommend it.

I'm HoH myself (100% deaf in left ear, severe-profound in right ear).

Depending on where you are, there may regularly held social events for Deaf/HoH people. Those can go a very long way to not only help you and your husband, but especially your daughter so she sees others just like her. It's likely to be at a place similar to, say, BW-3's (that's where I used to go to one all the time where I live). It's also a fantastic way to learn sign language and getting help because all of you will be totally immersed in that environment. It might be overwhelming at first, but I promise everyone there will be so eager to help!

HOH child here! Definitely do both English and sign language. Join deaf communities. You are not alone in this. There’s a lot more of us out there than you think and a lot of support!

Two of my sister's kids have genetic hearing loss so she's a few years ahead of you. 


My suggestions:


1. Reach out to your local nonprofit(s) for Deaf and HoH people and ask them to connect you with resources. Often there are more resources available  than most people are aware of. 
2. Start her learning accessible tech, languages, and devices before she needs them. For my nephew, it was a lot easier for him to adjust  to a hearing assist device in school because he wasn't having to figure it out and try to follow  along in class at the same time. 
3. Read up about  disability protection in your jurisdiction.  IME, as a child who had chronic medical disabilities growing up, if you don't know your/your kid's rights, you/your kid *will* get screwed over by folks who don't  care about  your rights (I could go into detail about my numerous near misses as a kid with brittle asthma, but I'll spare you. Suffice to say I know from experience that if you're not looking out for her, nobody is).

(Hug)

  
As a hearing Mom who raised two HOH kids, I wanted to chime in.  First of all, lots of good resources suggested. Just be proactive in your area and keep asking questions to get plugged in to what's available.

  
The path we took involved having our kids aided during all waking hours (except showers and swimming pools). I know it's hard when they're little, just do your best. My kids had hearing aids fitted when they were infants. Our goal was to have it feel weird to them when they aren't wearing the hearing aids since that is so crucial to development. 

  
And then talk, talk, talk. When I ran out of material I turned to books. We read books everywhere. On the floor, in the tub, in the car, on the sofa, in bed. The books became friends, but were really a gateway to language. Language acquisition came differently for my hoh kids than my hearing kids. They didn't absorb it like sponges. They needed more explanation, more interaction. 

  
It takes a lot of intention. But it does not have to be limiting. My two kids now: lawyer and medical laboratory scientist in their mid-20's.

Hi! I'm also the hearing parent of a HOH child. I recommend getting connected with the Deaf community, such as through a school for the deaf. Sign up for a Deaf mentor if you can. I have found it so valuable to learn from DHH adults since my child (16 months) cannot yet tell me about his experience. Connecting with other families of DHH kids can also be helpful, though to be honest, I've had some mixed experiences with other hearing parents having ableist views about our kids. But we do still attend playgroups and events for DHH kids because it's important to me that my kids see and get to know other DHH kids. I don't want my son to feel like he's the only one.

I also recommend learning ASL! Real time in person or virtual classes are ideal, but I know that can be challenging as the parent of young children. I have mostly been using the app Lingvano alongside the ASL at Home curriculum (https://www.aslathome.org/) and this book by Cecilia Grugan: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/714348/learn-to-sign-with-your-baby-by-cecilia-s-grugan-illustrated-by-brittany-castle/. ASL at Home is free to families with DHH kids. The latter two are both helpful for the kinds of vocabulary you need with young kids that might not come up as soon in ASL classes designed for adults. The site Lifeprint also has good resources, and the Oklahoma School for the Deaf offers free online classes every semester. We've also learned from our Deaf mentor. Learn ASL from Deaf people!

My son was diagnosed at 7 weeks and has had hearing aids for a little over a year now. I know it can feel like a lot to process at first, but truly, it's now just a normal part of our lives. You've got this!

Hi friend, I know things are stressful right now, and it feels like you're in uncharted waters. You've probably never met a Deaf person before. The good news is that this feels like unfamiliar ground but it's not. We've got the maps and now, we can help you find them too. Welcome to the Deaf/HoH community; we're happy you're here. 

Now, into the helpful stuff.

There are statistics on Deaf people, sign language, advice to learn ASL, Deaf cultural media and documentaries, and advice to practice and teach language, reading skills, and some other stuff besides.

hardofhearing,People look at me differently when I tell them I’m hard of hearing,"Hi all I’m 34, male. I take care of myself, I’m independent, I’ve built my life from scratch. But every damn time I try to talk to someone new a potential partner, someone I could genuinely connect with the moment I mention that I’m hard of hearing, everything changes.

It’s like a switch flips. The tone shifts, the replies get colder, and not long after… they vanish. I’m not angry about rejection that’s part of life but the reaction stings. It’s as if being hard of hearing suddenly makes me unworthy of basic respect or interest.

I’m not looking for pity or attention. I work, I live alone, I handle my life just fine. I just can’t hear as well as you do. That’s all. But people act like it’s some tragedy. The looks of pity, the “oh that’s sad” comments they drive me insane.

I’m honestly fed up. I’m not broken, I’m not less of a man. I just wish people saw the person first, not the hearing loss.

Anyone else who’s gone through something like this how do you keep your head straight when people keep treating you like you’re damaged goods?

[댓글]
Kinda trying to put a positive spin on this, in that they may be trying to make accommodations for you for when they talk to you?

For years ive said im hard of hearing which people dont really understand the implications, but now say partially deaf, which has better impact. Most people who know me, know to face me now, but that's taken years to ""teach"" them. Some dont bother and that's showing me the person they are, so I dont bother with them. Since partially deafness/hoh is more common, there is more awareness. 

However, there is one new meet, who will be chatting to others, I say hello and immediately she'll switch into exaggerated mouth movements and gestures. Almost talking to me like im stupid. But I take no offence. That's her ignorance and uneducated. I just smile and internally think im deaf, not stupid, go away and learn.

I’m sorry this happened to you. Those types of people aren’t worth your time. I gave up on dating because of my hearing loss, but have made many great friends who try to accommodate and are considerate of my hearing loss without making it a big deal or treating me as different. I hope you’re able to find people who don’t treat you like you’re damaged goods!

All. The. Time.

I just roll my eyes and ignore them and forget I ever crossed paths with them, honestly. I'm aware for some that's easier said than done, but a way to approach it is this: at the end of the day, does it matter in the grand scheme? Will you be thinking about this on your death bed many years from now?

There'll always be people like that, and there's not a lot we can do about that except control our own interactions with them. You could just walk away if it's bad enough.

As for the dating scene, if you're doing online dating, I find it helps tremendously to lay everything out on your profile. That's what I did and I eventually met my wife. I had nothing to hide or reveal on our first date, she knew up front what she was dealing with. That helps remove the anxiety on your part and, in a way, weeds out the potential mates you wouldn't want to be with anyway. Yeah, you might not get as many responses, but the few you do get? THOSE are the ones you want to be talking to. Especially the ones who contact you first!

Although I am also HoH, this rarely happens to me, people are actually willing to communicate. Also, your attitude towards life is positive enough so reactions people give to your disability hold no value. Sometimes we tend to lack confidence for this reason but then God chose us because we are strong enough to deal with it everyday. About the potential partner, not everyone is willing to communicate and stay for life given the challenges. I would say, look as much, go out and socialize through various activities, you'll definitely find the one.

Hello everyone I'm hearing of hard I'm not deaf .  
I just be alone everydays . It hurting too much I'm very hard to tell the communication.. that why  my friends is ignore me but I don't know yet what happened to me...
I'm hearing lost and my mind lost though 💔💔😭😭

I usually just mention it casually after we’ve been chatting for a while if it’s online. Usually before we plan to meet, and I just say it as a “btw you have speak clearly and directly at me because I have had bad hearing since I was young” type of thing vs hitting them with a medical condition right out the gate. If they are the right type of person they will want to know more as you get to know each other better.

I'm 35! I was in the same boat for a while.

Dating just reaaaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyy sucked as a gay dude. It's all so shallow now.  I ended up just putting everything front and center, and let people filter themselves out the door.

Dating feels so transactional and empty with the swiping - I had to mentally bolster myself, and just told myself that they are doing me a favor! You wouldn't want to be in a deep relationship with any of those people and then they suddenly reveal their shallow side and flake off on you when things are serious or you need them.

Someone who cares about you and is interested, will never be bothered at all, never be bothered by repeating what they say or learning new ways to communicate- And will be excited to be with you!

I just recently married after almost 5 years together!

There are good people out there, don't give up, but don't lower your standards for crappy people.

I went through the same thing. Lost my hearing in my early 30s and dating was a bit rough. I just stopped bringing it up or if people noticed, I just continued on as if everything was normal, because it was. 

If you're running into people that judge you at 34.... fuck em. I can't think of a single functioning adult that is worth their salt who would judge someone for a disability. Just do your thing man, there are plenty of women out there who don't give a shit and just want a nice, stable dude. It's hard enough dating in your 30s, the good ones are going to prioritize people who have their shit together over small physical things. 

I was able to land and marry a hottie as a mid/late 30s HA wearing male and I'm practically deaf, short, and pretty damn nerdy. If I could make it happen, I know for a fact that you can too! 

Biggest lesson I learned way back was that respect isn't earned, it's demanded. Meaning, if you act embarrassed of your hearing or bring it up in a way that opens the door to it, people will treat you like that. Just own it and be yourself. Confidence goes a lot further than you would think. Also, figure out where you can go on dates and hear well, wait a couple dates in for anywhere that might be a challenge.

Yes, this has been a common experience for me too. I put this info up front and center on my dating profile, I managed to phrase it in a positive way. ""It helps if you're interested in learning ASL or know some already as I'm \[deaf identity here\]."" 

The sad truth is many (most) people discriminate. The silver lining to this is being up front with the info saves me time, energy and emotional turmoil. There is no worrying about when to tell them like it's some dark secret. Anyone that connects has passed the initial discrimination filter, a promising sign.
  
I suggest focusing on making friends rather than going straight to a serious relationship. As a friend they get to know you. They see your heart and the (minor) flaws are no longer an instant disqualifier like they are when dating from the get-go. Relationships built on friendship is a great foundation as well.

Yup, I’m 35F and dealt with the same. As if it wasn’t hard enough dating with hearing loss to begin with!

I’m hard of hearing myself, granted only partially but I have a button that wear when I’m at work to tell ppl such. Some folks notice it and they speak up, or I tell them up front that I can’t hear them at first. I’ve even had some try to use sigh language which is kind of them, but I don’t even know much ASL!

I am sorry that you’ve faced such hurtles when it comes to your hearing, but I’d say it could help you figure out who is worth your time in some factors. Wishing you the best either way!

31f here and for me its kind of a joke. Like if you joke around about being deaf people are like, really? No way. And then they think its wild that im so functional even though the beep thresholds are in the 40s and 50s db 🤣😭

There seems to be a vibe that domes from saying you’re “hard of hearing” vs saying “I can’t hear very well” it’s weird but try and see if the people around you treat you differently?

I’m a 38 year old woman and I m literally in the exact same boat. I just feel like people don’t take us seriously or want to make the effort to communicate - even if we just have to ask for repetition. Yes learning ASL is great and that’s a whole community and culture but for us who are in the majority of the hearing world, it gets quite lonely.

OP, I'm very old and I've been very hard of hearing for a very, very long time and I've never, ever - not even once - experienced what you describe.

hardofhearing,Moderate Hearing Loss in One Ear - Seeking Advice for Next Steps,"Last week, after years of off-and-on tinnitus, a Meniere's diagnosis I never learned how to properly manage, and vestibular migraines, I found out I have permanent moderate hearing loss in my right ear.

My speech reception/awareness theshold is 25dB in my right ear, 10dB in my left. My word recognition was marked as 100% at 65dB for my right ear, and at 50dB for my left.

I was wondering if anyone out who has similar experience to this may have any recommendations. My ENT said a hearing aid evaluation is a reasonable next step, but she seemed to imply only some people similar to me find hearing aids preferable. 

My big question for that specifically is: Because my left ear is all good as of now, my main issue is struggling to hear people in loud environments, and differentiating someone/something I'm listening to from noise in general. Would a hearing aid help with this? Would it be worth some potential cons? And even the basics, like what even are the subjective cons for hearing aids? 

I haven't been able to find too much about those with a similar situation to mine, specifically when it comes to hearing aids, so any info would be very helpful.

Thank you so much!

I already posted something similar in the r/disability but I figured I post here too because a, I didn't get many clear answers, b, I didn't know this subreddit existed before I posted in the other. 

So, I'm a fursuiter, and I was wondering if it's okay for me to wear a hard of hearing badge (people mentioned ""impaired hearing"" may be offensive to the hard of hearing community)
I have a - diagnosed - selective hearing disorder and a slightly damped hearing on my one ear. It's already hard for me to converse with people in calm environments sometimes because I just can't hear what they say and need to ask to repeat several times. I'm imagining on conventions and especially in fursuit this would be even worse. 
I don't understand sign language very well. I know some letters and some simple phrases but that's it. There's also no real courses to take to improve this in my area. 

Thank you for your input in advance!

The text here blends in a lot, if you want people to read it I’d suggest more contrast.

Use the tools you have to communicate your needs; it is appropriate for you to make accommodations for yourself. If you search this sub you’ll see that the community is largely in support of people with auditory processing disorder using the label hoh to communicate their access needs to people.

As a Hoh person, I really would like to wear this badge. Yeah, it is okay to wear :D

Most people won't notice or read it unless you point it out.

Of course it's okay, but just a little advice.

Make it large.

I used to wear a small one, but nobody ever noticed it.  Now I have one, large button, large font.  It's pretty up front.

One thing though is my badge tells people what to do.  ""I am hard of hearing.  Please speak clearly.""

I think the best thing about the buttons is that they encourage people to be more patient.

Also....

How do I get one of these lovely buttons with this design?

Makes sense to inform people about it. But the logo looks a bit like some ad, or decoration of some sort, which contradicts it's informative purpose, imo. I'd suggest a clean and neutral badge, with no decoration.

If you’re hard of hearing then yes, perfectly ok.

Absolutely. 
In fact, I think that’s great. It will, hopefully discourage people from being absolutely rude when in certain situations where they assume you have ignored them/and/or other miscommunication that tends to happen with those of us who are HH/deaf/Deaf.

I actually have a t-shirt that says this. I like to wear it when I food shopping,  etc.

Yes. I feel like I need to keep one and whip it out whenever coworkers get sassy with me ""ignoring"" or misunderstanding them.

Where do you buy badges like these, or get them made? Because I feel like this would improve the quality of my life, tremendously

Ive “de-googled” so it couldn’t let me in the form. 

But if these are some of the things you’re looking for: 

My alarm clock is a vibrating alarm clock since I can’t hear an audible one. Yay!

But there are so many other things I need now or will definitely need in the next 5-8 years to be similar: 
- smoke alarm or someone calling in an emergency when I’m asleep that will vibrate like that
- for that matter a vibrating alarm for the security system on my house. It’s gone off 2-3 times accidentally while I was sleeping and didnt wake me. 
- basically vibrating tech that can perform some of the tasks of a hearing service dog.

I'd say real time captioning glasses is something I wish was a reality in the next few years. I could see Meta glasses having this capability but I don't think they will

I've had about 4 different models of shake-awake alarm clocks that store in pillows - all lasted a year or two, because the quality was crap.

If you're looking for budget hearing aids, Costco is a great option. They don't have as much programming flexibility as higher end hearing aids but they're more than enough for a lot of users.

I have been wearing Heardirectclub Nova hearing aids for a while. They are affordable and help compensate for my hearing loss. I was diagnosed with mild to moderate hearing loss. They go for as low as $500 a pair, they ship them directly to your address.

hardofhearing,Congenital deafness due to Kallmann syndrome,"I have a medical condition called Kallmann syndrome that affects puberty and fertility.

I also have two additional symptoms that are associated with having Kallmann syndrome, congenital anosmia and congenital hearing loss. 

My lack of sense of smell and poor hearing were both noticed in childhood but it took until I was 23 to be correctly diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome. The fact I had poor hearing and no sense of smell as well as not starting puberty should have led to an earlier diagnosis but that is another story. I was incorrectly labelled as a ""late bloomer"" for a long time as a teenager. 

I was once told I had 70% hearing loss in my left ear and 10% in my right ear. Senso-neural hearing loss. I believe the testing is different now. I used to have testing done through the NHS but they basically said it is not getting worse or better so they was not much point in having appointments any more. 

At school I was given a NHS (I live in the UK) hearing aid for my ""bad"" ear using a in ear mould. It worked up to a point but I did not like wearing it much and I ended up losing more than one of them.

As I got older I stopped using an aid for a while but found I had to restart about 10 years ago. The modern aids seem to suit me better and I got told that there was no point having an aid in my ""bad"" ear as no amount of volume would help, so instead I have a modern blue tooth chargeable aid (from Costco) for my good ear which suits me far better. 

I like the fact I can play podcasts from my I Phone through the hearing aid but I still wear headphones since I am so used to them and I do not have to worry about any noise leakage from the hearing aid.

[Per this copy of their non-discrimination policy available to the public in Google Search,](https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/Dignity%20Nondiscrimination%20Policy.pdf) you can contact their compliance office to indicate that they need to provide accommodations for you. They can determine what accommodations are reasonable/suitable and then instruct the office accordingly.

*  800-842-4681 (Voice) 
* 800-367-8939 (TTY)

Frankly this is absolutely appalling.

It's a one party state, you can record whatever you want if you're in the conversation. Your doctor's an idiot. This probably violates the ADA and you may want to insist on CART if you can't record (and you can) so you know wtf the doctor is saying. Auxiliary aids are exempt from HIPAA and it's your records being disclosed to you so it wouldn't apply anyway.

I'd e-mail a Hard of Hearing or Deaf or Disability group in the area to find out more.

Livetranscribe doesn't keep a record like the other person said but you're perfectly able to do so.

Not a lawyer not legal advice.

Android Live Transcribe has an option to transcribe without saving records

Is it something that they can arrange on their end?  They should be fine with a transcriber that they control, I would believe.

Ask for CART

That’s a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.

If it were me, I would tell them that you are a person with a disability and require accommodation to have equal access to care. Point out that they are violating the ADA and that they should be more concerned about that than you recording the conversation unless the care team is actively planning in advance to commit medical malpractice. Note that you are consenting to the recording so there’s no risk of you asserting a HIPPA claim. Request that they provide a suitable alternative or consent to you using your transcriber.

hardofhearing,PE tubes,"Anyone here have PE tubes? (Pressure equalizer) 
I got one put in when I was 12-14 years old, and I’m 26 now. 

I’m HOH with a hearing aid but it’s still there. (HOH from birth trauma and possibly the ear infections) 


I get 1-3 ear infections a year, even after the placement. I can’t clean my ear out because it’s narrow and my ear secretes extra wax, and it affects my daily life now. My ENT says the tube won’t come out on its own, and when I’m not dealing with wax impaction or chronic otitis media.. it works okay? I guess. It was supposed to help with my hearing, but seeing as I’m HOH even with the PE.. I don’t know. 


Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? Talk about? I feel like the tube shouldn’t be in there anymore but now I’m betting it’ll be a bigger issue. Is this just what I have to live with? I wonder if there’s scar tissue or something affecting the whole canal. I’m just lost on what to do, has anyone else experienced this?

I’m sure there’s some implications that would say it would make my hearing loss worse, but seeing as I’m already HOH, it’s not a big deal to me. It’s the constant internal sounds, and the fact that I can’t use my hearing aid when I’m having issues, which causes more stress on me. 

[댓글]
Just want to say I totally relate. I don’t really have an answer other than get a second opinion if you can since this current path doesn’t seem to really be working for you. 

I was in your position many moons ago, and because of the constant drainage and/or ear infections my ENT convinced me bone-anchored hearing aids were the better option. And they are if you can’t keep your ears dry. 

So I had the first implant surgery. And apparently my insurance stiffed the surgery center. So they refused to schedule the second one. And that’s how I have one BAHA implant. 

Years later I found a different surgeon who performed a tympanoplasty on one ear, and that’s been great. Got me to the point I could wear regular hearing aids. But the other ear has a microscopic hole that still drains and sometimes bursts so it’s still a chancer. 

*All that to say* you’re right. Permanent tubes and regular hearing aids don’t play well with each other, generally. You need a plan for dry ears or for a different type of hearing aid. If you’re current provider isn’t listening to your needs, get another opinion — assuming that’s an option. 

I hope you find a good solution soon.

I have one PE tube. It was inserted this year after many, many ear infections in my right ear. I am HoH but only really the right ear. 

The persistent infections perforated my ear drum more than once and I go so many infections. I don’t know why. I could constantly hear fluid in there and felt pressure a lot. The tube has really helped all that and I worry about it coming out and going back to life without it. 

Yours could be helping more than you think? Sorry you’re having a tough time. The unknown aspects of hearing loss are hard. A lot of what ifs.

I also work retail, and it's such a pain. I'm lucky enough to have loud colleagues and stable hearing, but still, it's insane the number of customers who mumble their orders; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble it slightly differently; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble in another different way; I ask them to speak up, and say it again; and then they yell at you; I usually pull out one of my hearing aids, show it to them, then say I'm hard of hearing, and ask if they could just repeat their order loudly and clearly; they usually do, and look kinda ashamed about yelling at me (which is the least consolation I would ask for). 

If you can get a few colleagues on side, to speak up for you (literally, not as in talk to management, although telling customers that they need to speak up is nice), you'll find it gets much easier. If you are able to take tasks from colleagues and give them the phone, that also tends to go pretty well if you plan how to do that ahead of time. 

But generally, retail is already crappy, but apparently it's more crappy if you can't hear what's going on. Finding the spare time to enjoy it is great though.",2025-11-04 22:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ool929/struggling_with_hearing_loss_working_in_retail/

I don’t hear the smoke detector so which brand do you use and why, like powerful strobe light. 

If my wife has a fall how would I know. The iPhone app would notify me after emergency notification. Any other ways to do this? And, she’s diabetic and would send an alert to my phone which I probably wouldn’t hear. Other than in the canal aids, any ideas? I take out mine at night.  TIA

[댓글]
If your concerns is specifically when you're asleep, I'd recommend getting a bed shaker. I got mine to alert me when the baby is crying, but you can set them up to go off with fire alarms, phone alerts, etc. Here's the brand I use: https://www.sereneinnovations.com/collections/home-alert

I have an IPhone and Apple Watch. Notifications can buzz on my wrist. It’s enough of a buzz to wake me up. Maybe look for an app that can connect to an Apple Watch. Apple Watch also has a fall detection feature. I don’t know how it connects to others, but I imagine it has some kind of alert system. 

Alternatively, look for an app that has different options for notification sounds. Something at a good frequency for you.

She can get a smart watch with fall detection. It will send an alert to your phone. If you have smart house things (like Google home and hue lights) you could program your phone to send those alerts to the lights so they blink. I don't know how to do that, but I know it's possible.

Ask your local fire department about smoke alarms. Many install ones appropriate for hearing loss.

You may want to look into getting an alert system for the deaf or hard of hearing. These systems monitor for common sounds (doorbell, kitchen appliances, fire/smoke alarm, baby cry, pet sounds) and send a notification of the sound to a receiver that alerts the deaf or hard of hearing person of the sound. Many of these alert systems also can be triggered by the push of a button transmitter. If your wife were to push the button, the alert system would notify you via whatever receiver mechanism you’ve selected (light, sound, vibration, or all three). 

[Diglo](https://www.diglo.com) (formerly Harris Communications) is a good source for alert technologies for deaf and hard of hearing consumers. 

[Sonic Alert](https://www.sonicalert.com/home-aware-signaling?page=1) has a [HomeAware system](https://www.diglo.com/sonic-alert-homeaware-ii-signaling-hub;sku=SA-HA360M-II;s=322;p=SA-HA360M-II) that listens for smoke/CO detector alerts/sirens and alerts the homeowner with flashing lights, sound, and/or vibration. 

[Silent Call](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/transmitter) also has [transmitters](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/fire-alarm-transmitter-contact-input) and [receivers](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/medallion-series-shake-up-receiver-with-vibrator-su5001mc) that can be tied into smoke/CO detectors (as well as phones, weather alerts, doorbells). 

There’s also a [Safe Awake](https://www.hearmore.com/product/safeawake-smoke-alarm-aid-with-bed-shaker?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21019171632&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADD0mp6_Y3kUzBvreN2C6OA7F6PdA&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8fbEk7jMkAMVbjRECB3-KiOMEAQYBSABEgJ71_D_BwE) monitor for smoke/CO detectors.

After researching my options for a few weeks, I just made the decision to get a [bundled alerting system](https://us.bellman.com/collections/alerting-devices) from [Bellman &amp; Symfon](https://us.bellman.com). Although the price point was higher than I would have preferred, I liked that the system is modular, easy-to-use, and has a wide range of plug and play transmitters, receivers, and accessories to choose from. This is my first alert system, and so finding something safe, simple, and scalable was important to me. 

I hope you’ll find something that meets your needs.

[EDIT: In my research I also found the following two First Alert alarm options that have strobe lights: [smoke](https://a.co/d/8nMdhBe) and [smoke/CO](https://a.co/d/28eD6yN). I think both of these would be good options for D/HH homes.]

[Another Edit: I also really like [SquareGlow](https://www.squareglow.com/). They are [deaf-owned](https://www.squareglow.com/pages/about-us) and more budget friendly than most, and their products have a modern look and feel. They have a reasonably priced [SOS button](https://www.squareglow.com/collections/accessories/products/squareglow-sos-button) ([SquareGlow on Diglo](https://www.diglo.com/shop-by-alerting-system/squareglow;d=3;c=33;s=341)). My only hesitation was not knowing how the smoke/CO safety part might work.]

hardofhearing,partial deaf and ear wax are nightmare for me,"Call this my bad luck or anything, but being a cerumen and partially deaf is a nightmare for me. The earwax makes it more tough to listen to other people. Also, i have been using earphones a lot lately, which i might think are also a reason for the increase in earwax buildup. I have had this earwax tool and it has performed great till now, however i wonder if someone else is facing a situation like me.

I remove my earwax daily and it has now become an after shower routine for me, as throughout the day the earwax eventually builds up and clogs up the ear.

[댓글]
Earwax problems are  a  common for me too cause when I put on my hearing aids my body makes extra earwax to push out the „foreign  body“. So I think a similar things is prolly happening with your earphones. You might want to wear headphones instead just to be safe

I’m in the same boat and have my ears professionally cleaned about once a year. I wear OTEs and AirPods and it’s just the best thing to do - anyone who wears something in the canal daily and produces a lot of wet wax naturally would generally benefit from getting it looked at occasionally and discussing what cadence of cleaning makes sense.

What hearing we have is so precious that I simply don’t risk doing the removal myself.

Would be worth having a specialist look at it and see if anything could be done medically",2025-11-02 08:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ombvgx/partial_deaf_and_ear_wax_are_nightmare_for_me/
hardofhearing,Looking for an app or device that helps with text to speech?,"Hi I’m currently a student. Lectures are hard with my hearing loss. What are your favorite apps that help with transcribing what the person in front of you is saying into text? Im also looking for a device that does something similar. Thanks! 

[댓글]
I’m a big fan of live transcribe for everyday use, although there does seem to be some difference in accuracy between the free and paid for versions. I’ve never really had a problem with it personally and have found paying for the app worth it. 

I also occasionally use the otter app if I know there’s going to be many different speakers. It also summarises the conversation and allows you to save them to look back on.

I use an iPhone so can’t tell you whether these apps work for android use. Hope you find something that works for you.

Android LiveTranscribe is free and pretty accurate. I have the app on my phone but I also have several cheap Samsung tablets that I use exclusively for LiveTranscribe and several of my friends keep a tablet at their houses with LiveTranscribe in case I come over. It’s nice having a dedicated device so I can use my phone for phone things while having a conversation. It doesn’t differentiate between speakers, but you can have it save your conversations for a period of days.

Lots of decent Speech to Text stuff.

Most people like LiveTranscribe on Android. I mostly used that until I wrote my own app.

If you're in the US you have the right to accommodations per the ADA(for now with the way trump is gutting everything). This means you can use/ get/ demand CART which is like closed captions in class. (Yes, even if you have an ASL interpreter) 

If you're talking about just everyday personal interactions, I use live transcribe but it's always a hit or miss. It often misunderstands to the point of where I'll just put it away bc it's nonsense. 

If you have enough hearing for it to be worthwhile, you can invest in a Roger pen; which is a microphone that connects to your hearing aids for people to talk into.

Both Apple and Android have Live Transcribe or Live Captions built in.

Otter.ai is my preferred app for live transcription, it saves the transcript, although you have to pay.

Innocaption is a free call transcribing app that also offers human transcribers, through the FCC.

Grain.com is my actual favorite app for transcription that I use on my video calls, however it's not live. I use the Zoom or Google or Teams captions during the call and then get the Grain transcript afterwards. Best quality I've found.

But you were looking for a text-to-speech app. How would that help? Shouldn’t you want a speech-to-text app?

for real time lecture transcription, google live transcribe is probably the easiest option if you’re using android since it instantly captions what’s being said. if you want to record lectures and later convert them to text, uniconverter does a good job handling that offline so you don’t have to depend on wifi or cloud services. it’s pretty useful for reviewing notes privately afterward.",2025-11-02 02:20:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om5w00/looking_for_an_app_or_device_that_helps_with_text/
hardofhearing,I’m new here! Any advice? How are the people here?,"I just got diagnosed with Mild Hearing Loss a couple days ago after teachers and my parents started to realized that I was struggling with my hearing.

It’s only mild of course, so it shouldn’t be a big deal, but I’m kinda worried.

I can barely hear my friends in large crowds, and microphones sometimes don’t help as they echo, making the words sound gibberish or muffled to me.

I can’t understand men well since their voices are deeper, which means I have trouble talking to my dad, brother, and friends that are boys, and it kinda makes me sad.

I think it’s affecting my school life too because I tend to not understand what my teachers are saying, but I’m too scared to ask for them to repeat themselves because I don’t want to be accused of not listening.

Right now I’m teaching myself ASL. I used to do it when I was younger before I grew out of it, so I need to reconnect with it.

But anything else? It kinda hurts to not hear everything, and a bit scary too.

Edit: I’m also teaching myself to lip-read, and it’s actually a bit easier than expected, but I still struggling with it.

We’re all frustrated and exhausted and have commiseration as a group. Get proper hearing aids. ASL is good to learn but you need someone to communicate with and that’s a big expectation.

Welcome to the group. Who diagnosed your hearing loss? Did you have a comprehensive hearing test with an audiologist? Did they review your audiogram and explain what it meant in a way you could understand it? Besides diagnosing you with mild loss what did they recommend? If you’re not understanding in multiple situations they should have recommended some type of assistive devices such as hearing aids. If not, why didn’t they? 
Lots of questions that you deserve to have answered. Many of our first lessons in having hearing loss was the importance of advocating for ourselves. We need and deserve complete information. If you’re in the US check out the Hearing Loss Association of America at hearing loss.org. I’ve learned so much from them and you do t have to be a member to access their resources. You can handle this with help from those who know. Good luck!

Thanks for explaining further. I’m not an audiologist so I hesitate to contradict what you were told after three tests, but I decided to google “no hearing aids for mild hearing loss.” I did so based on your clear description of when you have trouble understanding words. You’re better than most people at identifying and describing your challenges. I do know loss of high frequencies is the most common symptom. It especially impacts how well we understand in noisy environments. Most Google results say people can be helped. Here’s what the Cleveland Clinic (a trusted source) says”:
 Even people with a mild degree of hearing loss may find that they are having trouble hearing what they should. Today’s digital hearing aids give audiologists the capability of programming the aids to fit a wide range of hearing losses. You don’t need to have a lot of hearing loss to find that a hearing loss can cause you a lot of frustration. Persons with a mild hearing loss may find that they have difficulty hearing quiet speech, or hearing someone speaking from a distance. If a hearing loss is negatively affecting your life it’s time to schedule an appointment with an audiologist to find out what amplification options could benefit you. “Hearing aids are for people with a great deal of hearing loss. I just have a mild hearing loss, I don’t need hearing aids.” There are many options available to help people with any degree of hearing loss – from mild to profound. An audiologist can review these options to see which would be the best fit for you!”
 I identify with your frustration but I don’t want to cause you trouble with your provider, so please proceed as you feel comfortable. Sometimes second opinion can be a good idea.",2025-11-02 01:12:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om4j0o/im_new_here_any_advice_how_are_the_people_here/
hardofhearing,Has anyone experienced this?,"Went for a hearing test yesterday and the results were 3 losses between 1-8hz at 30db and the rest were at 20db in one ear, the other has a drop at 4hz at 40db and the rest were at 15/20db.

For the worse ear, she said a HA wouldn’t help even though I fall short in 3 areas despite working with primary children and having tinnitus. Real world experience was quickly dismissed.

She said if I’d been 70+ she would have given me tablets for the tinnitus (didn’t know that was an option…) and HA’s won’t do anything for the tinnitus.

She asked about the tinnitus and I said it was predominantly in one ear but I could hear it in both. Was I sure it was only one ear because if it was I need an mri but if it’s both I don’t. I’ve had the tinnitus for 10+ years. 

She then asked ‘so what are you going to do?’ and I said get a new job as I can’t hear the children with the background noise so I’m effectively unable to do my job. 

The next statement from her ‘I’ll write a letter and see if you can have one as you’re borderline’ despite being at 3 30db losses. Who exactly is she writing to? 

As I was leaving she ended on saying ‘I’ll put you forward for a HA, if it doesn’t work at least we’ve tried’.

I’m in the north of England and have waited 18 months for the NHS appointment and when I got there I felt I had to beg for help and she was spouting BS, am I the only one or was she right in what she said?

Reading this over I feel it’s more of a vent but I’m curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar? 



[댓글]
I was told by my audiologist that he wouldn’t push me for hearing aids as that was my decision to make. With that being said I’m not sure exactly who she’s writing to. Maybe because your hearing loss isn’t severe enough she’s worried that the manufacturer/ hospital won’t want to float the cost. 









Additionally while I understand that hearing aids aren’t necessarily a treatment for tinnitus I don’t understand why she wouldn’t give you treatment for it. Ask for a second option from someone else and get an appointment with an ent if you haven’t.

Definitely get a second opinion. The NHS is a fantastic resource but it's so overstretched and underfunded, it's a struggle to get the help you're supposed to be entitled to. When you find the right person it's amazing and they can change your life, but it's a fight to find the right professional and then say the right thing to them. I was born deaf but I was 26 by the time I got an appointment with a professor in ENT, I said ""no matter how loud the hearing aids are, nothing ever gets any clearer"" - and because of him, I got my BAHA processor on my 27th birthday :) Before him, they just kept turning my hearing aids up and up and up...

Stand your ground the best you can. Write down everything she said while you can remember it and at the next appointment, ask them to explain everything in detail. Bring a handy hearing person to sit in with you if you've got one. I'm in my thirties but still ask my mum to come with me to these type of appointments because she's great at asking WHO are you writing to, when I'm still processing that she'll write to someone.",2025-11-01 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om2xz0/has_anyone_experienced_this/

hardofhearing,Panic attacks in therapy - can't lip-read,"Hi. I have experienced a couple panic attacks in therapy and due to that I can't lip-read my therpaist so she can't help me to regulate and work through the panic attack. Does anyone have any ideas for how she could help me during a panic attack when I can't lip-read her to follow directions etc? 

[댓글]
This is in person? Instead of just talking through she could model techniques that do not rely heavily on verbal instructions. For example, the butterfly tap can be demonstrated. And also, you need to have a conversation about this and come to an agreement as to what helps in these situations. She is the therapist but you are the expert of your experience.

Literally text on paper and body language. And very important: talk about it and agree on what the steps are and somewhat rehearse what to do while you're okay. Trying to teach someone how to get theough it while they're in the deep end is hard regardless of ability to communicate.

I’m so sorry you’re suffering with panic attacks. You might want to try Live Transcribe or another transcription app. There also are therapists who specialize in working with deaf and hard of hearing patients. (((HUGS)))

My family has a lot of HoH people but no one knows sign. What has worked in these situations is having a plan ahead of time and hand signals. Like we have one for ""sensory overload, I need to go outside,"" and one for ""I need space right now, can't talk."" Maybe different techniques could have signals, or you could use visual cards. This isn't the same as a full language like sign language but thats how my family gets by.",2025-11-01 10:13:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1olk8kx/panic_attacks_in_therapy_cant_lipread/

hardofhearing,Pros and cons of rechargeable hearing aids?,"Looking to get new hearing aids in the next year, but I've been told by my audiologist that my only options are rechargeable ones. I regularly listen to music through bluetooth at work, so I'm worried about how long the hearing aids would last before needing to be charged again. My current pair are from Oticon, so I'd appreciate any reviews that are specific to them. Thanks!

[댓글]
I have rechargeable oticons, and I’m so happy I made the switch. Mine are connected to my phone by Bluetooth 24/7, and the charge typically lasts about 20 hours. It’s been an absolute godsend to not have to think about carrying batteries everywhere.

i had battery driven ones, and now i have rechargeable ones. I must say battery is 100 times better. You can buy batteries from amazon like 400 for 20€ or something. 

I just hate the fact that you have to spend extra 200€ on a box that can charge your batteries and dry them. And if you forget to charge them ( what happens to me sometimes) the day will be hard. If you forget battery you can jsut go to a shop nearby and buy  them there. 

If i had to choose again i would buy batterie driven hearing aids. 

Also they are often 100€-200€ cheaper.

I have Phonak hearing aids. I regularly use the Bluetooth option. It lasts me from 7am to 10pm so pretty much all day, even when using the Bluetooth. I can't think of any inconveniences for me at the moment, has them for 4 years.

I listen to music pretty much continuously from waking up until bedtime on my HAs and have maybe once had the battery run out (and that in my right ear which has the volume higher thanks to that ear being worse). I wouldn’t get anything else.

I resisted for a long time for god knows why and I wish I’d made the switch sooner.

Your audiologist is either misinformed or lying.  There are battery options for many hearing aid brands/models--even the Oticon website shows battery options.  Our son (19) insists on battery hearing aids and just received a new pair in September.  He sticks with Resound the majority of the time (he has the Nexia model right now).  He had rechargeable Phonaks a while back and returned them within the return window.  He didn't like the sound quality, and he streams a ton, so he was having to use his old ones as backup while the Phonaks were charging.  He also likes to wear at least one to bed (yeah, I know...), so he has at least one in 24/7.

  
We had a three day power outage a while back, and he was quite thankful for the battery hearing aids.  He wouldn't have been able to charge them.  Also, rechargeables degrade in battery life over time.  Probably an unpopular opinion, but it's definitely what works better for the way our son uses them.

Rechargeable batteries have a finite life.

Modern rechargeable batteries can last all day. I have signia HAs and they never want to sit in the charger right, so I have woken up to a dead battery several times. Some HAs use induction charging to solve that problem. 

I have the same signia HAs with disposable batteries. Overall, I like the disposable batteries more. One downside, in the US, is the new packaging.

Well now you have me wondering if listening via Bluetooth has more impact on the battery than just regular daily listening (not Bluetooth). I would think it wouldn't make much difference, but I don't actually know. 



FWIW, I have Phonak, Audeo P90. I charge them overnight and the battery lasts from 6 am until about 10 pm, with probably not more than an hour or so of streaming a podcast or book. Music sounds a little weird through the HAs and I can't figure out what setting to change, and it's not worth it to me to spend the money for an audiologist appointment so she can click this or that setting so that my music sounds right. So I just use AirPods or a speaker to listen to music. I can fit the AirPods in with the HAs still in, and it's not a great fit but good enough. I can hear well enough that if the fit is bothering me I just take out the HAs and use the AirPods alone.  



Despite the hassle of needing to charge them (and needing to recharge them partway through the day if I'm going to be staying up late), I still like them better than batteries. I was always having my battery die when I was out, and I never carried batteries around with me every day but I hated to waste part of the battery by changing them too early. Once I was on my way to the movies when I heard the telltale signal and I had to pull over and make an emergency run to the drugstore for new ones. Plus the guilt of throwing all those batteries in the landfill or trying to find a place that accepts batteries for recycling (now basically impossible)...it was a bummer. So I'm Team Rechargeable.

I had no choice with my Phonaks, they only come with rechargeables.  However they easily last all day with a fair amount of bluetooth use and luckily I haven't forgotten the charger on overnight trips.

Most people i know who has them and who have also had HA's with batteries say theyre a downgrade.

Im from the Netherlands where we get insurance cover for 75% every 5 years for new HAs. The last time i purposefully went with battery charged HAs because of all the negative reviews.

I did notice a lot of technical improvements from the 5 year ones before that (2017 vs 2022) though I must say, these ones are becoming shittier and shittier and I kind of really need new ones now but i gotta wait so long.

Im really hoping by the time im eligble for new ones the rechargable situation has improved a lot atleast.

Im sticking by rechargeable! I have the Phonak Audeo rechargeable and the battery lasts close to 24 hours if I don't stream anything. I LOVE the fact that they're Bluetooth and I can take calls and listen to music on em when needed. The reason why I got phonak is that they have an extra battery pack you can add to the charging case for traveling and its been a blessing!

I'm about to start working in the medical field, so this was a must have. Rechargeable for life! No more lost batteries, or dead battery packages. 

Only downside is if the battery does, you have to send the whole aid in to get fixed. I hate doing that since I NEED both to function. Luckily, I've always had temporary devices available, but I would rather there was a better way around it.

My considerations — I like the rechargeable but these are the pros and cons:

* You will lose your charger. You either need two or you need a plan for what to do while you wait for the new one to arrive. It's not like a phone charger.
* You can buy batteries in any drugstore.
* Batteries can give out at any point during the day, leaving you fumbling to replace them during a meeting or dinner. Rechargeables if you store them at night will last through the day.
* If you're listening to music a lot, you will run through a lot of batteries.
* The new battery packaging is hot garbage and may be a ploy by Big Battery to get you to go rechargeable.
* Before your 3 year warranty is up on the rechargeables, you can send your HAs in for a warranty replacement and they will give you new ones. They do not do that for the battery version.

I’m on my third set of OTICON HA’s and my current set is rechargeable and THEY ARE THE BEST!  The charge lasts up to 15 hours and that’s with me using the tv sound converter box via Bluetooth and/or listening to music. ♥️👍🏼🤩

I am awful at remembering my HA when I get home since I only use them in public. My batteries last like 4-5 days and I don’t think they cost too much

I made the switch to rechargable oticon hearing aids last September (2024). I will never go back to battery powered hearing aids.  They've changed my life.  I'm a mom of 3, ADHD and it's one less thing for me to remember. It's awful to be out with the kids and have to stop and buy hearing aid batteries bc the diaper bag didn't have the new package.  Also, I've only had them die once but it's because I woke up at 4am, put them on, used them all day till almost 11pm... Insane battery life with the charge.  And they connect right to my phone. It's so nice!

I've only tried rechargeable ones but they last 16h for me so I don't have issues with them running out and I always remember to charge them with my phone and my smart watch every night. However I do get worried I'll lose the charging box thing as they are ridiculously overpriced plus then I'll be stuck until I can get a new charger.

My HAs use 312 batteries and is &gt;3 years old now. When I replace them it’ll probably be rechargeable. 

How many charging cycles do the batteries last and are they replaced? If yes, what is the cost?

I have rechargeable phonaks- they bluetooth stream well and they last all day even if I'm streaming.

I listen to audiobooks. My last from when I get up in the morning to when I go to bed at night.

I'm in the process of getting new hearing aids too. I've had my set of rechargeable hearing aids for going on 6 years, previously had a few iterations of replaceable battery hearing aids (essentially from the age of 5 to 14, so 9 years). 

I'll say, that the rechargeable hearing aids are great, the battery life throughout the day (even after 6 years, and only minor repairs to some parts) is amazing, I can usually get 20-ish hours of use on a low Bluetooth day, and 16\~18-ish hours on a day with a lot of music and videos. 

The only issue I seem to come across with them is that \*when\* you do forget to plug them in over-night, you're out of hearing aids for a day, unless you can charge them on-the-way-to or at work, or whatever thing you need to do that day. However, if your current hearing aids are still serviceable, it may be beneficial if you are able to keep them to work for the hour-to-three-hours that it takes to charge the hypothetical new ones; that way, you make up for the down time that charging takes up.",2025-10-31 18:47:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ol2v7m/pros_and_cons_of_rechargeable_hearing_aids/
hardofhearing,Plugged Feeling but Everything Normal?,"Hey all!

Had moderate to severe hearing loss in my left and deaf in my right ear my whole life.

A few weeks ago after my Rituximaub infusion for MS, I noticed something felt off.

Felt plugged up or sounds muted a bit. Went to a CVS MinuteClinic and no signs of ear infection. Went to an ENT and had a bit of wax removed and a hearing test.

Test showed a 5 drop in the 250 range and like 15 in 10k and above.

My ear was puffy from wax removal and both the ENT and my normal audiologist didn't see anything concerning as the changes fell within normal range of error.

If I clear my eustachian tubes everything sounds better. Been taking a generic antihistamine to try and help.

Finally, my hearing aid is an Oticon OPN so not sure if that thing is EOL since its old.

Long story short to say I have no idea if this is weirdly psychological since according to the experts nothing is wrong?  

[댓글]
It could be psychological or it could residual puffiness from the cleaning or slight inflammation or irritation from something like allergies

That plugged feeling can totally happen even when tests look normal. It could be mild Eustachian tube stuffiness or just your brain adjusting post-wax removal. Give it time, stay on the antihistamine, and maybe get your OPN checked older aids can sometimes distort sound a bit.",2025-10-31 11:47:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1okscwg/plugged_feeling_but_everything_normal/
hardofhearing,Are children loud(er than average) because of HoH parent?,"I had mild-moderate hearing loss when my first child was born 6 years ago and I got my first hearing aids around the same time. In the meantime I progressed to moderate-severe loss, which was only detected a year ago. I'm just now testing new aids and adjustment is difficult, my world suddenly got really really noisy again. Especially my kids (4 and 6).  
I knew that they are ""of the louder variety"" already. They like loud play (stomping, running, shouting, arguing...) but also their normal talking voice seems louder than average.   
Their father keeps complaining how loud they are (his hearing is very good). And we had neighbours complaining that our kids are too loud (we live in an appartment building).   
And I myself feel that I cannot really assess their noise level. With the new hearing aids they aften seem sooo loud (but the rustling of my jacket is also really loud...), without it's no problem (obviously).  
  
Now It suddenly occured to me: what if it's me being HoH causing my kids to be so loud? That they feel the need to be loud to be heard, literally.  
What are the experiences of other HoH parents?

edit: vocabulary

[댓글]
I think in general when they’re younger no. Little kids are loud because they haven’t learned to control their volume yet. However older kids say around the age of 10 might be louder if their parents are hard of hearing. That’s because they have learned that they need to be louder than normal for their parent to hear them.

I'm HoH (severe-profound), lost my hearing around age 2, but it wasn't diagnosed until I was 4. the teachers and doctors were actually concerned my brother had hearing loss because he was so loud, so he got tested before I did, but it was just that he was speaking loudly for me. all my siblings are louder than normal, and I have a loud family in general, in part because I'm HoH. I never noticed it growing up (obviously, to me it was a good volume), but my wife was the one who pointed out to me that I have a loud family lol. I don't know if that's common, with children being louder because of HoH family members, but it happened here!

I'm loud, but I'm also hoh/deaf 

I grew up with family who were hoh given we had to SPEAK up 

My whole family is loud 
We don't yell we project, lol 😆

Totally possible kids naturally adapt to how we respond. If they learned Mom hears better when they’re louder, they’ll keep doing it. Also, with new aids, *everything* sounds extra intense at first. Give it time your brain will adjust, and they’ll learn volume control too.

I think it’s common for Hard of Hearing people to be annoyed by noise, since hearing aids don’t cope with noise well. It’s difficult to communicate if it’s noisy. I probably hush people, require good lighting and eye contact. Loud volume is not something I appreciate, the hearing aids can amplify, from people I expect clear speech.

I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and HoH in my left. So, my kids grew up with the fact that I couldn't hear well and also couldn't afford a hearing aid. 

My youngest daughter is 32 and a couple of months ago, at work, was told by a coworker that she ""laughs too loud and talks too loud"" sometimes. She said: ""Oh, sorry. My mom is deaf and sometimes I forget that I don't have to be loud."" The person scoffed with a ""yeah, right"" before walking away. I asked her: ""Do you want me to come to your office and stand next to her desk and not respond to her when she demands to know who I am and what I'm doing there? Because I WILL!""

My son (34) was once told by a woman he was seeing that he ""laughed too loud"". I told him that wasn't a ""deaf mom"" thing so much as it was ""we're a family of cackle-laughing seagulls"" thing.

I have a four year old grandgoblin and sometimes, my daughter (the 36 year old) will ask me how I was able to tolerate three noisy kids. I just smiled and took out my hearing aids: ""I didn't have these!""

Yep. Household of five here, 3 are hoh. The baby of the family has normal hearing, but boy is she LOUD. Ha!

I’m the kind of hoh person that just wants the important info. My kids (2&amp;4) are surprisingly not loud but I do think they’ll probably come across as rude as they get older because it’s acceptable in our house to just say “nevermind” when I don’t hear or speak with a loud angry tone if it’s important. E.g. if the situation isn’t easy for hearing I usually just answer with “I can’t hear you” or “is it important?”. I often can’t be bothered making the effort to hear. 

Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re fairly quiet when they’re older. In a 2 storey house my husband and I often just text each other instead of yelling. I assume the kids will be the same when they get phones. Hoping to learn a bit of my country’s sign language when the kids are a bit older.",2025-10-31 11:41:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oks8st/are_children_louder_than_average_because_of_hoh/
hardofhearing,Battery life shorter?,"Anyone else notice battery life getting shorter? 

My 612s used to last a week, then the time got down to 5 days, now the time is 3 days. Nothing in my daily routine has changed.

[댓글]
Check if there is a bluetooth option, &amp; if so disable it - bluetooth is radio, which sucks battery life. I also discovered with my new aids that had a different battery compartment, that closing the hearing aid overnight storage container lids would compress on the hearing aid battery compartment, turning the aid on, reducing battery life!

Are your batteries the same make over the years? 
Also, if your batteries are of the zinc-air type then they should come with a sticker on one side. This is to cover the air access hole. Air activates this kind of battery, which then slowly discharges, lessening its life. Ensure to leave the sticker on until you are ready to actually replace a flat battery.

Seems the only other things that have changed are the make of batteries, &amp; the models of hearing aids. Can you pinpoint a time that reduced battery life coincides with either of those changes?

Might be more features on your hearing aids draining battery, higher volumes if your hearing has deteriorated at all, listening to more noise throughout the day or using Bluetooth more?

I used to have a noisy job and it certainly made a difference. I have rechargeable though.

Yes! I felt like the first I used my hearing aids they lasted for a couple weeks now I only get a week out of them. My perception  of time isn’t the best so I thought I was going nuts. Additionally my hearing aids are linked by Bluetooth to my phone and I use them a lot so I figured it made sense they only last a week

As batteries age or humidity changes, life drops fast. Could also be firmware updates or more Bluetooth streaming. Try a fresh pack or different brand to compare.",2025-10-31 03:14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1okjxo3/battery_life_shorter/

Today in audiology class we were lead through how to perform hearing exams on each other by trained individuals and a audiologist. I could not hear 500Hz in both hears, my 1000Hz threshold for one of my ears was 15dB, and when we used headphones that perduce music by laying on your bone and vibrating the malleus, incus, and stapes I could hear there was music but could barely understand the words. If this is not normal hearing is there a way I can prevent more hearing loss?

You should probably make an appointment with an audiologist and they can explain your results. 


Normal hearing is between 0-25db so 15db is fine.

That does sound below typical thresholds. Since you already have tinnitus, it’s worth getting a full audiogram from an audiologist.",2025-10-30 15:48:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ok3auc/did_a_hearing_test_in_todays_lab/

Maybe bone conduction headset

If you don‘t wear hearing aids (which you could BT stream the audio with, and control the balance between audio stream and outside world (hearing aid mics)), and if you don‘t want to use open over the ear headphones, there are also ear buds that do not occlude the ear canal (e.g. Sony‘s „LinkBuds Open“).",2025-10-29 20:44:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ojg2sz/gaming_for_hard_of_hearing/

[댓글]
I am hard of hearing beginning in my 30s. It’s tough, I won’t lie to you. It can be very lonely, at least for me, because it’s hard for me to hear in group settings.

However, it truly has made me focus on the type of people that will be supportive of me regardless, which has shown me the type of people I want to have in my life. 

If you do have hearing loss, the most important thing you can do is to get tested. I know firsthand it’s scary as hell, but if you leave hearing loss without treatment (whether that’s steroids, surgery, or hearing aids), your hearing nerve and brain will get used to not having the sound input. That can cause long-lasting damage to both.

So please get tested. Cry and scream at the results if you need to. But please know that having something “wrong” with you, if that’s what the test shows… simply means you’re human. 

Not better. Not worse. Just human.

I had to start therapy and was prescribed Zoloft. Both really helped!

Have they tried putting a tube in your ear with the pressure yet?

Let me ask a few questions, if I might. 

When did this dysfunction occur? Was it a sudden onset? If so, can you tell me the circumstances surrounding it? 

I hear do you live? Have you always lived there?

How are your sinuses?

Have you seen an audiologist, an ENT, genetic counselor?

Oh to add, I’m kind of scared? Hearing aids are so expensive. Is there anywhere I can find them for something more reasonable?

You could post here or at r/AudiProcDisorder.

Having a processing disorder is often associated with hearing loss (depending on your disorder) they tend to go hand in hand. 

Hearing loss is something EVERYONE will experience in life, I’m glad you’re able to read lips, it’s extremely helpful and you are welcome in EVERY COMMUNITY!

I too have auditory processing disorder (ANSD) and all my hearing tests were normal and I finally got to know about ANSD after a ABR/bera test.
For me too, over the years (especially after covid and resulting very limited social interaction) it has become just a little bit difficult to understand people and ask them again and again (specially in noisy enviornment with more than 55 db of background noise). My Audiologist also recommended a hearing device to me.
I guess hearing issues does form a broad spectrum and we all can share and learn from each other's perspective and experience 😃

Plus you’ll prolly still find usefull/relatable info

I’ve never heard the term Auditory Processing Disorder, but it sounds like me. 

I lost 40% of the hearing in my left ear in 1995. But the loss was to the tone test. When it comes to identifying the sound, or speech, or what direction the sound comes from, I can’t do that with the left ear. If the right ear is brought into play, my comprehension score comes up, but still not anywhere near 100%. I also still can’t tell what direction sound comes from. 

Is that what ANSD is?

I was born an estimated 50% deaf in my right ear, although I’d debate that I’m more 75%, sounds that’d be painfully loud are like soft voices. But my left ear can hear fine, although I’ve admittedly given myself tinnitus from years of poor choices with earbud volume. 

Especially since you need hearing aids, I think the label would fit for you. I don’t even have hearing aids right now, although lord knows I’m trying.

Audioprocessing is a neurological condition that affects how your brain processes audio. Physically, you still have the ability  to hear. 

Hearing loss  is physical. Loss of hearing.  

2 separate things. They actually have a reddit for APD, though. 

I don't think you need permission from strangers on the internet it's a free country. 

You do what feels best 👌🏼

That is absolutely not true. 

Not all processing disorders are related to auditory dysfunction. 

For example, you can be dyslexic and deaf. You can have sensory textile processing disorders and be deaf. You can have cognitive dissonance disorders and be deaf. 
There’s a whole SLEW of processing disorders that have and don’t have anything to do with the auditory system. 
The issue is there is not a set of official guidelines in the ICD-11 Consult or the DSM5-TR, in fact, currently Processing Disorders and APD are not included in either due to a whole slew of factors. 

(Mainly, they don’t know jack shit about ANY of these so they can’t properly explain, diagnose nor treat them. If you haven’t LIVED or experienced a processing disorder, how, I ask, will you understand it?    You don’t. )",2025-10-28 22:59:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oioaz7/im_unsure_if_i_am_allowed_to_be_apart_of_the/
hardofhearing,Can't find reliable sound-sensor/vibration system,"I've been looking for a bed-shaker system that will alert me to sounds. I've tried two or three models, but they all have this really frustrating and confusing wrinkle: the sound sensors that transmit to them only detect LONG sounds. They often seem to be marketed as ""baby cry sensors.""

That is, they'll detect most ringtones, or a person going ""AHHHHHHHHH!"", but they won't detect a person *shouting* my name (which is just one syllable). More worryingly, I found that the one I'm using currently won't even reliably detect a smoke detector going off, even when the smoke detector is right next to the sensor!! Presumably this is because the smoke detector beeps are very short and/or high-pitched. I have no idea why this ""long sounds only"" feature is a thing. Maybe they want to protect from waking you when a door opens or closes? But hell, if it'd disturb a hearing person, I'd like it to disturb me!

Does anyone use a sound sensor/vibration system, and have you found one that is reliable for short sounds?

hardofhearing,95 year old grandfather can’t hear almost anything on phone through hearing aids &amp; barely anything in person through them. I tested him using earbuds &amp; he could hear great. Should I set him up like this permanently or are there risks to what little heading he has left?,"His hearing doctor is also a ways away and has not seemed to be helpful in the past and it’s a huge headache to get him to that doctor, so I’m hoping to just do this myself but don’t want to ruin his existing hearing.

I’d have to buy and replace his phones (wireless home phones) with phones that have a headphone jack.

Before I do all of that I’m wondering if there’s a better approach. I know they have hearing impaired phones with a large speaker but I’m unsure if those will be any better than just yelling into his ear. I know the earbuds work. I’m also wondering if I should be considering over ear headphones that way he doesn’t have to take his hearing aids out and tell people “hold on” every time someone calls, but I know in the past overear headphones for watching TV have interfered with his hearing aids and caused them to shut off, unsure if that’s because the over ear headphones for his TV were wireless though. So I just want to keep things as simple/reliable as possible while also not damaging his hearing. And considering his hearing is already damages are there are volume limitations I should set up/get a pair of headphones that CANT go past a certain db reading to further damage his hearing? 

Furthermore, if this works out I’m wondering if I should be thinking about alternatives for his hearing aid situation in general. He can’t hear at all on the phone and he can barely hear in person, so I’m wondering if I should look into/make a setup that is basically just earbuds permanently in place of hearing aids but with a Microphone strapped to his hip or whatever (possibly a directional microphone that points where he is looking/at the person he’s talking to?) that then feeds to his hearing aids? And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

I’m just past the point of wanting to go through the Dr because he’s went to this Dr many times and cannot hear a damned thing through his hearing aids yet I use a random pair of earbuds from home and he could hear clear as day. So I’m hesitant to burn 10+ hours going back and forth to Dr to get new hearing aids and spend a bunch of money for something proprietary that might not even work. 

[댓글]
I think he needs a new doctor to check his hearing if possible

See a new audiologist. Why keep going back if you're not getting what you want out of it.

If he is able,  transcription apps allow us to l read what is being said irt....  A way to keep communication open until his audiologist helps

Another vote for a new doctor. 

When you say Hearing Doctor, I want to be sure we are on the same page. I’m talking about an ENT, or a licensed Audiologist with a partnership with an ENT, at the least. Please don’t take him to one of the mass market hearing aid places. I’m referring to Beltone, Miracle Ear, Clear Tone etc. 

I’m sorry to say there are too many people out there that don’t want to invest the extra time it takes to work with some of our older seniors. Your Grandfather is a member of the greatest generation that ever lived, and we all owe them a debt of gratitude. A little extra time spent working with them sometimes results in hearing about history we didn’t know.

New doctor/audiologist.

There's transcription apps. **Live Transcribe** is popular and works well. I have one too but its not out in eu yet.

Earbuds like for a walkman or amplifier? Or AirPods? If it's the latter, if that works hey, I mean not really recommended but ppl are doing that. If it's the former, eh. Do they have costco where you are? They'll do an audiogram with their in house audiologists and sell you a hearing aid and not an amplifier.

They have multiple (hardware) transcription devices for phones too. I have moderate hearing loss and I rarely have any idea what anyone is saying on the phone. I just put it on speaker and tell people to feel free to shout. I'm ok on zoom etc since I speechread.

&gt;And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

Nothing works in a crowded room, it's why I won't generally wear hearing aids. That was the only thing that mattered for where I used to work (teaching). It was listening to a cacophony of overlapping human speech. Focusing on a single speaker was like picking out water drops in the rain. When you amplify that it's just a louder cacophony, not easier to discriminate sounds or speakers.

A lot of hearing aids just do not work well either and many audiologists are just glorified (hearing) appliance salespeople. I think you found one of those w/your grandfather.

Hope that helps and lots of luck! *fingers crossed*

It's wild how regular earbuds sometimes work better than expensive hearing aids. Just be careful with the volume so it doesn't blast his ears even if he can't hear well. You could also look into OTCs. They're kind of the middle ground between regular earbuds and full-on prescription hearing aids. My FIL has the audien ion pro and they've been amazing for everyday stuff without the constant doctor trips.

I wonder if government phones might have some of those helpful hearing impaired phones I've never heard of that but I'm about to ask them if they do if you have those government phones where you are I would try that too but definitely a new audiologist if this one isn't helping it's a lot of searching around for the perfect one but I'm sure you'll find maybe a better one closer",2025-10-27 19:07:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ohnf3v/95_year_old_grandfather_cant_hear_almost_anything/

hardofhearing,Can I get a hearing test without a doctor ordering it?,"Hi,

Does anyone know if there is a way that I can get a hearing test without a doctor's order? I know I can do that at Costco, but they only let you get one every six months, and I last had a hearing test four months ago. But if I’ve experienced sudden hearing loss now, I need to get treatment *now*. Not two months from now. Also, if I get a hearing test without a doctor's order, my medical insurance probably won’t pay for it. So I'm also wondering how much a hearing test actually costs, if I have to pay out of pocket. Thanks!

[댓글]
For sudden unexplained hearing loss your dr should get you in right away. Outside of Costco i don’t know whereas you could to get a hearing test not approved by a dr. I think the amount it cost can vary state to state so to be on the safe side you should google your area

I have no idea what the situation state-side is (where I presume you are?) but in Canada I was definitely able to just call up a hearing clinic and ask them for an appointment directly (I didn't have a GP at the time).

You need to see an ENT, not just an audiologist at a hearing aid shop. Call your insurance to see if you need Referral

I walked into the local clinic and said I think I'm going deaf ... No doctors no papers they set me up with an appointment. Now may differ based on location though

I've never had a doctor order a hearing test recently before 2020. I have been the one ordering them. I go to the office that deals with my hearing aids or the hospital where I had my CI surgery.

The hearing aid places will give you a free hearing test to sell you hearing aids, they are audiologists. You just have to be prepared to walk away &amp; finagle your results. That’s a quick, free answer before you see your ENT (not a substitute for)

Try free phone apps or Costco

[댓글]
I have the oticon ones with the actual hearing aid that sits behind the ear and the molded earpiece that goes into the ear. It is quite easy just to pull that bit out. —as opposed to hearing aids that are just little buds or something.

Anyway, so Yes, absolutely I will just pull the ear piece out and let them hang until whatever foolishness is over with.

Edit: I don’t know why, but your question reminded me of a story about Ian McKellan. He’d gone to see a play where one of his friends was starring. Afterwards he was giving the usual praise about how much he enjoyed it, and the friend replied, “We could tell you enjoyed it, you didn’t even take out your hearing aids!” Idk why that tickled me so much. Maybe bc I’d never thought about being “caught” doing it!

Ugh, loud sudden noises are rough. You can try asking your audiologist to tweak your compression settings. It can help dampen sharp spikes like that. Personally, I use audien ion pro and they seem a bit less reactive to sharp noise compared to my older ones. They got quick-switch profiles for noisy places so I can just tap to tone things down.

I really only wear mine to work or to situations where I need to understand every single word. The world is so noisy. If I'm just going out to run errands or at home I will typically leave them out and rely on lip reading and asking for clarification. I can still hear lots of things but it's easier to tune out. I do get easily overwhelmed when I wear them in a loud environment. I will turn them all the way down, or like the other comment said just pop the speakers out of my ear canals

If the sounds are bothering you, turn your hearing aids down or off! That's what I do; there's no use hearing when it does more harm than good, especially for loud noises that can actually damage your hearing in the long run.

Hearing aids don't help me in most situations- im HOH in one ear- it actually overstimulates me in situations where there is more than one person or child talking

I work in an upper elementary school in SPED. I’ve absolutely taken my hearing aids out while dealing with a student who is escalated and being very loud. It’s damaging my hearing by leaving them in, not to mention probably going to trigger a vertigo attack for me. Maybe it’s rude, but tbf I don’t think my students have ever noticed it in the moment.

I am in the same situation.  I had my audiologist set one of the buttons on my hearing aides to mute so I can quickly mute when a loud sound happens.  I live in the city so the ambulances and fire trucks are super loud.  When I take the subway I wear Sony earphones over the ear kind over my hearing aides.  I don’t even turn them on or anything ,  just having them up over my hears is enough to dull the screeching subway trains.  I also have a custom “ calm” setting that I made for noisy situations where I still want to hear but way softer like noisy restaurants or my office where the loud overhead AC vents drive me nuts..

I struggle with this situation - and am not convinced that wearing hearing aids in loud areas doesn't further damage your ears.  Doesn't the loud noise you no longer hear still damage your hearing??

I recently opted to put earplugs in my ears when out on long walks rather than wear my hearing aids.  The every increasing traffic noise has been too much for me - I stopped looking forward to walks.   So now I just leave hearing aids at home and plug my ears with those simple foam ear plugs to reduce the decibels.  I can still hear the hum of traffic and my head swivels around paying attention to the traffic, people, cyclists etc around me.  My ears no longer hurt after a long walk, since I cut out the over exposure to noise. 

I don't believe that my decision to remove hearing aids and wear ear plugs is ideal  - but it still doesn't make sense that wearing aids in loud environments doesn't further harm my hearing; especially when my ears physically hurt after lengthy exposure to environment.  It's not like you can quickly cover your ears when a car or store alarm goes off.

I am interested in this post and look forward to reading all comments.

I honestly just pop open the battery compartments so the hearing aids *block* noise instead

Unfortunately the answer you don’t want to hear is……. You get what you pay for, I have a profound hearing loss and have worn hearing aides since I was 22.  I am now 56, and have grown through all of the technological advancements.  Set aside the arguments that you shouldn’t have to pay this much to hear and just accept reality, it is what it is.
Get the absolute highest technology from a reputable doctor of audiology and you will find this day and age has automatic noise reduction built in.  They will automatically turn down the volume when sensing the incoming volume is a certain percentage above ambient sound.  Obviously it’s more complicated than that but we don’t need to know the physics, we just want to hear.  You will find it strange at first when it happens because it will also give you a perceived pressure change that takes some getting used to.
Make sure you get quality custom ear molds and a quality audiologist that will be patient with you.  After I get my new ones it typically takes about 6 weeks of at east once a week appointments for the audiologist to get them dialed in for my use.  If they are not willing, they are not worth your money.  Remember, if your audiologist is not hearing impaired themselves, they do not know what it’s like to have this affliction.

hardofhearing,"My ears ""transferring"" the fullness feeling?","Earlier this year in January, I had my right ear blocked from trying to get water out of it after swimming at a hotel pool (I tried shoving my finger inside) and I have never been to an ENT once, since my parents don't have time to get my ear checked out, and they think its not a big problem. Fast forward to today my blocked ear suddenly popped its fullness away, but my other ear felt a little blocked after that. I tried the method where I block and blow out of my house to pop the tubes, but when I did that, my right ear felt blocked again. Does anyone know what could be going on with my eustachian tubes?

You should speak to Elivania Abreu, Fonoaudióloga

You have a high frequency hearing loss. Search for ""speech banana"", map your loss,  and you can see the speech you will miss . Your audiologist should be able to give you an explamation. If they can't,  find a new one!.

The line in red goes down and then up a little bit, the other line goes down not as rapidly.

In short, you can hear (roughly) normally in most frequencies, but you don't hear higher pitched sounds nearly as well. Your ears are roughly the same, but your left ear is your better ear. This may mean you have trouble hearing certain speech sounds and quiet high pitched noises like electricity whine, whispering, sounds from small animals and insects, etc. It doesn't mean that you *can't* hear those noises, just that you have more difficulty than the typical person. 

I'm not an audiologist, just hard of hearing myself, so I can't say whether hearing aids would be needed, but if your audiologist/hearing aid tech recommends them, I would look into it if financially feasible. Unaided hearing loss has been linked to increased rates of dementia in later life, so it does have implications for brain health.

Looks like mine from 5 years ago.

The line of the left is percentage of sound heard compared to normal hearing. The negative # is better than normal. The numbers on the top are frequency starting from very low to medium sound, drums, vibration, low notes pretty well but I can't hear higher so high women's voices. (ie soprano}, become indisputably non existent.

Disclaimer: I am not an audiologist, but from my understanding as someone who has studied audiology in undergrad,
You have a bilateral high frequency hearing loss that is slightly asymmetrical. The degree in your right ear is moderately severe at high frequencies (over 4k Hz), and the degree in your left is is moderate at high frequencies (over 4k Hz). At all other frequencies (4k and below) you have normal hearing. It looks like you only had air conduction tested, and without also testing bone conduction, the type of loss cannot be determined for certain.

I want this hearing : (

X-axis is the frequency of the sound.


Y-axis is how loud that frequency has to be in order for you to hear it.


The shaded area is a normal range of hearing. Anything in the white area indicates hearing loss in that frequency. The lower you go, the worse the hearing loss is.


You have moderate high frequency hearing loss.",2025-10-24 19:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1of7maq/can_you_explain_my_audiogram_in_detail_if_possible/

hardofhearing,Sudden hearing loss after blowing my nose – anyone had this and recovered?,"I’m 25 and a today I was congested from a cold. I tried to pop my ears by blowing gently into my closed nose — and I felt a small “pop” in my left ear.

Right after that, I got dizzy, nauseous, and even threw up once. Since then, my left ear feels full, I hear almost nothing from it, and there’s constant ringing.

I went to the ENT today and got diagnosed with:

Sudden hearing loss (hypoacusis) due to barotrauma

The eardrum looks fine (not ruptured), but they confirmed significant hearing loss on the left side. Tomorrow I’m going for another hearing test and likely steroid treatment.

Has anyone here experienced sudden hearing loss after pressure / blowing your nose, and did your hearing recover?
How long did it take, and did you do any specific treatments (steroids, oxygen therapy, etc.)?

[댓글]
It very possible that this can be an issue that can be corrected by having tubes (or a tube) put in ear(s).

Can you describe what you hear? Is it muffled/stuffy? Like it seems like your ears are suddenly stuffed?

Go to emergency, if there is any chance that the loss is due to lack of blood/oxygen to the ear, the longer you wait the higher chance of permanent hearing loss.

I had the same issue, after like 4 days it turns  out to be pressure difference between the ear and the environment. I was also sick, maybe my ear was infected and it cleared itself

Could be a round window fistula

Sudden hearing loss like this should be seen as soon as possible by a dr. According to many credible medical sites  (NIH in the UK, Harvard medical and Mayo clinic in the US) you have about a10-14 day window to address this (assuming it continues) without at least some permanent hearing loss resulting. The longer you delay, the more likely so e or all hearing loss will be unrecoverable.",2025-10-22 17:04:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ode1rg/sudden_hearing_loss_after_blowing_my_nose_anyone/
hardofhearing,Any tips???,"So for the past month my hearing has been deteriorating and I have been struggling to hear people a lot. For context I work in a very busy cafe/bakery and there are voices constantly which is quite annoying for me. I was wondering if people had any tips to help keep my focus on what people are saying to me. I want to try lip reading but I’m not able to in my job as I have to look at a bunch of screens while people are talking to me. I already had a complaint from this woman who shouted at me from across the place and I didn’t hear her and when I explained my situation she said “we’ll fix your hearing then” lady if I could I would mate but luckily my boss is so lovely she went over to the woman and asked her not to speak to me like that so I am very thankful for my colleagues and managers. But it is just hard on me aswell as work I also go to school for engineering in an airport so I have alot of noises going on in the workshop which makes it hard to hear people which is a recipe for disaster
I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, I don’t have any resources to get to my closest doctor and my mum won’t drive me 😢😢 that just puts out any hearing aids for me but oh well I think I can manage without them I would just like tips on how to keep focus on people and lip reading!! Thank you 

[댓글]
You need to get a dr. There very little that can be done until you know what your hearing is. Medical help is a right in most countries and not getting a child medical attention is neglect and not legal in most places.



















Furthermore lip reading is not an exact science  and while there are classes for lip reading and sign language if you don’t have the resources to get to the dr i don’t see how you would get to lip reading classes.

Agreed, find a way to get a hearing test whether it be someone driving you or an uber. You can try to work on auditory training to hear in the presence of background noise, such as listening to an audiobook while they’re another source of sound like a tv show on to try to train your brain to filter out extraneous noise. but ultimately, hearing test is your better move

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Like the others, I urge you to prioritize getting to the doctor as soon as possible, preferably to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist, but in the very least to a primary care physician, understanding that you likely will need to follow up with an ENT. I know it’s difficult to take time off for work for medical appointments, but some hearing loss is treatable. Also, some hearing losses need to be treated as soon as possible for the best chance of recovering hearing. 

Lip reading is a helpful context clue for understanding what’s been said, but it’s more an aid than a solution, as many words look similar (e.g., “I love you” and “olive juice”). There are live closed captioning apps (system accessibility settings, apps like Live Transcribe) that can assist with in person and telephone communication. 

One difficulty it sounds like you may have is communicating when your vision has to be directed toward screens (unless you can have a transcription program running at the bottom of the screen that detects and transcribes nearby speech). Sighted deaf and hard of hearing individuals often are highly dependent upon their vision for communication, and adapting to a newly acquired hearing loss takes considerable visual cuing at first. 

Again, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Prioritize your medical treatment, then work on finding the best communication options for you. There may be support services for the deaf and hearing impaired in your area, and it would be good to reach out to them too. 

Best of luck!

[EDIT: Wanted to add that hearing aids can be life changing for some people experiencing hearing loss that can be remediated. You should definitely try them if given the opportunity. They might be the best solution for you. However, do keep in mind that noisy environments create challenges no matter what solution you’re using.]",2025-10-22 16:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oddo6v/any_tips/
hardofhearing,Phonak Roger One rant,"My wife got me a Roger One a couple years ago - it's an extremely fancy remote mic. It works pretty well, but the construction is *shoddy*. After two years of light use, the power switch broke so I can't turn it *off*. I didn't drop it, it didn't get wet, it just...stopped working. Phonak is charging $200 to fix something that cost $2000 new.

Having a remote mic is nice but the construction quality is inexcusable for something this pricy.

[댓글]
If it happened to you, it probably happened to others too.  Complain to the business you purchased it from and to Phonak.  If they do not provide a suitable solution, post here again so others know to avoid it.  I couldn't afford it when I  tried it a few years ago and certainly would not consider it again if they cannot support it properly, it's definitely an expensive accessory .

That's ridiculous. You'd think something that expensive would last more than two years. Maybe see if CS will do a goodwill repair but if not, there are better-built options for way less. My MIL's audien ion pro aids cost under $600 and have survived daily wear and tear no problem.

This was my feedback to them when they invited me to a Roger users focus group. The difference between the Roger Table Mic and Table Mic 2 is astounding. The first generation for me is still going strong, battery lasts ages but the Table Mic 2, after just 2 years, I have 1 (out of 4) that no longer takes charge. 

Knowing Phonak, it is planned obsolescence. If your device breaks within the 2 first years though, they just replace it. Had this happen with a Roger Pen and a Roger On.

Please DM me with details of your Roger.  I may have one for sale, and am happy to negotiate.",2025-10-22 14:16:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1od9ibm/phonak_roger_one_rant/

You can demo the Shokz at places like Best Buy or Sam's. One ear has a lot of distortion and I do a little better with them compared to open ear headphones.

My surgeon prepared me to not hear out of that ear for a long while.

hardofhearing,The idea of a device that allows you to feel orchestral music through vibrations,"Hello everyone! I'm a sound engineer, and I want to make classical music concerts more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing.

The idea: a device called ""Touchestra"" — a small board that represents an orchestra map, divided into sections (percussion, strings, woodwinds, brass, etc.). When a section starts playing, its corresponding sector lights up and begins vibrating at its own unique frequency.

And before I proceed with any further work, I need your feedback!!

1. Would something like this even be in demand? Could it help deaf individuals get closer to the music of a symphony orchestra?
2. Do you attend classical music concerts? If yes/no — why?
3. Will different vibration frequencies be perceptible at all?
4. What inclusion options have you seen in practice, or have you simply thought about?

I welcome any and all answers; it's important for me to see opinion from my target audience. It's better for me to understand if it's needed now than to create something that finds no application.
Thank you very much in advance

The problem is orchestra. You can pull that off for like 3 instruments. 4 gets to be a lot. 

There's no way to parse out an orchestra. Would be too much to make sense of. Maybe a board thing like for sports, but I don't see the appeal.

Watch Mr. Holland's Opus for how to make music accessible to deaf people.

A new way to be accessible! I have a friend who built a platform that vibrates to the base of music. I like it a lot even though I feel the base (he doesn't). I've told him he needs to build something for people like me who have lost the high frequencies. He hasn't had the time. He's making music accessible in other ways now.

Look up ""haptic"" shirt + deaf. Also Opus Sound Bed.  There are also Ayurvedic versions made of wood with strings underneath the practitioner strums.",2025-10-19 00:17:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oabq2k/the_idea_of_a_device_that_allows_you_to_feel/
hardofhearing,A victim of my fathers hearing aids,"Dear Hard of Hearing Community,

Edit: I've the the same question worded differently and as I'm new to this I didn't know that it was pretty important, but should have realized that it is: the model I believe is rexton reach r-li t, it things that go in the ears are custom fitted. All of this has been done through public healthcare (Denmark) so I don't know that much but at least I think the fit is to standard but would most likely have been even better done in the private sector. Finally I've never heard the sound when his ears are covered all though that doesn't happen often, I've only heard it when he is messing with the software settings on his app and he never adjust anything sound wise on hearing aid themselves. Thank you for all the curious questions and suggestions to far


I’m reaching out as a victim of my father’s recently prescribed hearing aids, hoping that someone here or maybe a relative of a hard of hearing person can answer my question.

So, he got these hearing aids that he *does* need. They’re fairly ""modern"", which means they come with a lovely little app that lets him adjust the volume, sensitivity, and all sorts of other settings.

Here’s my problem—and the reason I feel like a victim of them:  
Why the F@$# do they have to make a horrendous sound every single time he makes even a single microadjustment?!

Why does it have to sound like a thousand grasshoppers screeching right next to my ear, in a tone so high that any not hard of hearing person above the age 40 probably can’t even hear it?  
Why does my hearing have to suffer just because he’s tweaking his hearing aids through some app?!

Please, I need this explained. I'm losing my mind 

—A 24-year-old victim of his father’s hearing aids

  
P.S**.** He’s a 61-year-old fiddler, so he loves to adjust the app often, also when I’m visiting, forgetfull of (having commented on the horrendous sound) and obviously unable to hear the sound currently MESSING WITH MY MIND. I feel so alone in my suffering, being an only child and thus the only one in relative nearness to him WHO IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO HEAR IT.

[댓글]
Please mention the make &amp; model number of the hearing-aids he has, as this enables pinpoint research of the issue, whether it's limited to just this model, or across different makes etc

They shouldn't be making any sound if they are in his ear. If there is feedback happening while he's wearing them, they are not fit correctly and he should return to his audiologist for an adjustment. (Or he is doing something like cupping his ear).

Feedback.  It’s a speaker and a microphone very close together.  If it gets covered at all, the sound coming from the speaker bounces back into the microphone.  It’s the same as when you hold a microphone up to its speaker on a stage.  Or when two people have their mics on in the same room on a zoom call.

When I was first dating, it was a fun proximity alert for how close my boyfriend and I were dancing lol.

They can sometimes be adjusted to not have so much feedback, but they are limited by how much amplification is needed for the patient.

When my grandmother got older, she couldn’t hear the squealing, so she’d sit there with it low level squealing until someone told her to fix it.

Sounds like a poor fitting process from the audiologist. What you hear is called feedback, and you will also hear it when hugging him or when something covers the microphone. Basically, it’s sound leaking from the speaker to the microphone and creates an unintended feedback loop causing the squeaking sound. 

Modern hearing aids are pretty good at minimizing feedback. However, it is important that sound doesn’t leak through the piece in the ear. For mild hearing losses, sometimes domes are good enough. In your case I’d make sure your father doesn’t use domes, but custom made ear molds. The sound actually becomes better with well fitted ear molds.

Go back to the audiologist and discuss the problem.

Also, a more important thing is that you need to understand that your father still have hearing loss. Hearing aids don’t really solve anything. Yes, they amplify the right frequencies so that we can hear them, but they cannot make the sound any clearer. This means that they help in quiet environments at short distances to the speaker, if people speak clearly and you see the speaker clearly. It’s up to you to change your view on communication. Never speak from a different room, make sure lighting and listening conditions are good. It’s fatiguing to listen even with hearing aids, since the cognition is used to just identifying and processing sounds, instead of being available for information processing. Keep that in mind, and always be flexible to make communication easy and less dependent on listening.

So it only makes the feedback sound when he's adjusting it? He's not bringing his hands anywhere near his hearing-aid when adjusting the settings? If he is, then the cupping effect will cause feedback. If he's not, then there's an issue with the hearing-aids and/or app that needs to be reported to the manufacturer/provider of the devices.

In my experience this kind of feedback comes from either handling or touching the hearing aids, a poor fit (perhaps the domes are too big or small) or a buildup of earwax. 

I’ve also had this problem to a degree when I need a haircut and my hair touches the aids.

Are his hearing aids custom aids? There’s a manufacturer that does programme and volume changes to the custom aids by making the phone emit a specific pattern of high frequency chirp. The aids “hear” this sound and execute the change in volume. This is to get around the fact that not all customs have a Bluetooth receiver, so as to make the aids smaller.

I also get a short beeping sound when I switch my program setting for both my hearing aid and my processor, unless the batteries are low.

my hearing aids do this too with any little adjustment and even to me the sounds Is so high screeching and annoying idk why it does that maybe you can turn it off ?

Oh lord. 

FEEDBACK. 

It isn’t just your worst nightmare, imagine being HIM. yeah. He hears it too. 
Also imagine the single most annoying jingle you’ve ever heard. Got it? Yeah? Now imagine having to hear that jingle play every single time you put your hearing aids on because that is the very thing that you hear when you turn your hearing aids on that jingle is what is programmed into the hearing aid as the start up to you that the hearing aids are on every single time you want to hear you start your day to the most annoying sound you have ever heard yes yes that’s what you have to look forward to as you get older and you start to lose your hearing. It’s inevitable because everybody starts to lose their hearing. It’s a biological evolutionary process.

I was born with severe nerve darkness, bilateral both ears diagnosed at 18 months. The doctors told my parents I would never learn to hear. I would never learn to communicate. I would never understand sound at 18 months old. I was with hearing aids in both ears and started intense. Speech therapy I went four days a week for three hours, one day, four hours the next day, alternating on the last day of the week until I was 4 1/2 years old, my speech is absolutely perfect to the point that doctors do not believe that I was born without language never had language never had hearing. I went into profound deafness in my late 30s and could no longer use hearing aids. I got a implant in 2022 and it is the best thing that has ever happened. Hearing aids are horrible horrible horrible I cannot recommend hearing aids to anyone. All they do is amplify sounds they give you feedback they are just awful. They are awful if I have been able to get a cochlear implant much earlier in life I would have done so that difference between the two is  astronomical; hearing aids are absolutely worthless and this is coming from a person that has had lifelong hearing loss. I have never experienced life any other way and I am telling you hearing aids are just horrible.",2025-10-18 18:03:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oa2nue/a_victim_of_my_fathers_hearing_aids/

[댓글]
That’s really a discussion for you and your audiologist. I’m not a specialist but in my unprofessional opinion I imagine there would be some improvement if you had hearing aids.

Do you feel like your quality of life is affected? That's the main thing. Also you may not realize how much your missing till you try them out. Go chat with an audiologist and see what they recommend.

This looks like you could benefit from hearing aids but like fallspector says, talk to a professional.

Blue is usually the left ear and red is the right. I’m pretty sure that’s universal but happy to be corrected. I’ve had HAs for years and the colour has always been Red-right and Blue-left.

I bet hearing aids would help. They aren't hearing miracles but they would make a difference. My life is easier with them than without them. I have workarounds for hearing limits and that makes a difference too. 

[https://hearinglosslive.com/unrealistic-expectations-hearing-aids/](https://hearinglosslive.com/unrealistic-expectations-hearing-aids/)

I have only around 40 decibels loss as of a few years ago, like others said, you need to ask your audiologist. 

But one time I got tested at Costco and they gave me hearing aids to try while I shop, I was blown away at everything I was missing. Unfortunately for me, every audiologist recommends I have many channels and the cheapest was like $5k-$6k pre-pandemic. I have congenital and acquired hearing loss and they call it ""cookie bite"" because my audiogram looks like a big semicircle, like someone bit it. That's why I need many channels to have more adjustability.

You could test some and see what it is like.

Looks a little like mine from memory and I can't hear shit

Someone’s already said it but talk to your audiologist

We are not doctors - talk to an audiologist

It depends on your hearing. A test from an audiologist is the best way to know. Hearing aids help some people, but aren’t always needed.

Your questions aren’t useful at all, I’m afraid. I don’t think you understand what it is like to live with deafness or hearing loss. You need to read up on that. 

* Accommodations such as interpreters, CART, external microphones and so on should be available in a class. If someone can’t volunteer in class, it’s not solved by design, but by assuring better accommodations and understanding of how to structure the communication. (Read about Nyle DiMarcos school experience in Deaf Utopia, for example.) The inclusion in schools is a much bigger problem than design.

* Install hearing loops and ensure hearing aids have a t-tool.

* Make information and communication visible.

Research the potential accoustics...type of floor, walls, etc. I would prefer a room with excellent acoustics to any design.",2025-10-16 12:57:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o85gbd/please_help_with_my_uni_assignment/

hardofhearing,Hearing test results and hearing aids at 27,"Hi! I just wanted to get on here and see if anyone had a similar “story” and test results! 

I, and all my friends, noticed my lack of hearing around 16 yrs old. Since then it has been a constant conversation through school, meeting my husband, and at work. Well, 10+ years later I finally go take a hearing test. I was SHOCKED when the audiologist recommended two hearing aids. Just wondering if anyone has a similar “cookie bite” and if you have noticed any more decreases throughout the years. 

I understand that since this is genetic, I really can’t base anything off of others experiences. But purely curious! 

Thanks in advance!

Cookie bite here, similar story as you.  In my late teens people kept telling me to go get the wax cleaned out of my ears and whatnot, heh.  I knew it was there, my wife and I joked that I was the eyes and she was the ears, but I didn't deal with it until 45 years old and it was really affecting both my work and personal life.  I did feel like it was getting worse. 

Hearing aids have been life-changing, I really didn't even realize just how much of the world I was missing.

I have cookie bite loss, I don’t know how much loss there’s really been aside from the typical slight loss in the 8k range, which for me is still above average (?!). My hearing loss was first suspected in second grade, but my parents never really followed through about it until I was 17 and got a pair of hearing aids that really worked for me. They help so much because I always say “I wasn’t meant to hear people”, as my loss is focused similarly around where most speech falls. The difference with them in and out is day and night. At home it doesn’t matter so much, but being able to function at work and having conversations is so worth having hearing aids for. If you can get a pair, I think you’ll find them worth it. I found myself much less exhausted because I wasn’t trying so hard to hear all of the time.

Oh wow, yours is like perfect cookie bite. I have that as well, i had hearing aids in elementary school, hated them and quit by third grade, tried again in high school, gave up within a year. In my early 30s i finally admitted i was struggling more, and got another hearing test done. My cookie bite is now a cookie bit, the ends have evened out to a pretty steady across the board loss with a smaller dip in the middle, but the upside is hearing aid technology is wayyy better!

Welcome to the club buddy! I’ve had cookie bite as a teen and my chart is a little more C shaped but about the same :)

I don’t have a deaf community I’m ingrained in or have a job that can accommodate me easily (I’m a teacher) so HA it is and it’s been a life changer for me to be able to work in the hearing world.

Mine looks almost exactly like yours but more symmetrical. I have noticed a bit of a decline since I started wearing aids and have had them modified a bit. I didn’t start wearing them until about 5 years ago (37) but probably needed them in my 20s. I haven’t figured out which side of my family the hearing loss is from. I really benefitted from aids in conversations. Good luck!

Cookie bite here. Mine has been steady for about 15 years.

TIL of cookie bite hearing loss! I thought it was so weird you had loss in the middle frequencies instead of high like most.

Just curious from the professionals, who is able to adapt better to understanding speech with hearing aids?  Those with a cookie bite loss or those with high frequency loss?  I'm observing the comments about how much hearing aids helped the cookie bites. I'm a high frequency loss person but it's still a struggle even with the aids in both ears. So, just wondering what the professionals say?

33. Also cookie bite. Had hearing issues my whole life and got hearing aids just over a month ago. It’s been a huge improvement in my day to day.

Basically same story (34f) - sister kinda always knew, then high school it was fairly obvious/a joke that I was deaf. There were a lot of signs in my 20s, e.g wondered why phones never turned up to an understandable volume 😂, starting to need subtitles for the tv. 

It was shockingly apparent at the start of COVID-19. Couldn’t hear a word through the masks🫠 got hearing tests and the technician was so confused “normally the line goes straight up that way or  that way if it’s not perfect… 👀” (went to proper audiologist and ENT soon after). 

Been using hearing aids for a few years now. They work pretty good, but still more hard of hearing than everyone else with them in. Thanks for sharing",2025-10-14 19:18:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o6owmt/hearing_test_results_and_hearing_aids_at_27/
hardofhearing,"For my fellow HoH Android users - I made a free app like Live Transcribe, but with the 'Save' button we always needed.","Hey everyone,

Like many of you folks, I'm Hard of Hearing. While I think Google's Live Transcribe is a fantastic tool, I always got frustrated by one thing: I couldn't save the transcript. It was useless for practical things like taking down my mother's grocery list, because the text would disappear as soon as I closed the app.

I've seen this sentiment shared here before, and I was especially inspired to finish this up after seeing the great app a developer made for his HoH partner on iOS last month. I wanted to make sure us Android users had a great option, too. 

So, I built Transcriboar. It's live now and it's 100% free.

Link to Transcriboar on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neonsnake.transcriboar

Think of it as Live Transcribe, but with all the features we need to actually use the text later:

* Save transcripts to your phone
* Edit and Rename saved files
* Share the text with other apps
* Print directly

And, of course, a cool boar logo, which was a significant feature I felt Live Transcribe also lacked.

Most importantly, it's truly free and private. Everything is stored locally on your device. There is no cloud, no data recording, and no expensive AI subscription. I used the same fast, free, and reliable API that Google already provides.

Please be kind, I'm just one guy who built this in his kitchen. I wasn't compensated and I don't make any money from this. I just wanted to build something that would genuinely help me and, hopefully, others in our community.

Thanks for checking it out.

P.S. / Important Info:

* Privacy Policy: https://neonsnake.com/privacy.html
* More Info: https://neonsnake.com/transcriboar.html
* Availability Note: Currently, the app is live in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. I'm working to expand this to many more countries very soon

You are an amazing one guy who built this in your kitchen. Maybe the best

Thank you so much.  Transcription was so critical during my husband illness and it was frustrating not to be able to have the conversion to refer back to. 
I just downloaded the app and will try it out tomorrow.

this is an excellent initiative and an example of your brilliance!

Hello! It's not available in my country (Malaysia) yet but I just wanted to say a HUGE THANK YOU for putting in the time and your expertise to build this app. I saw the same post last month on the iOS app and totally wished someone would do the same for us Android users haha...
But truly, life already can be so challenging and it's kind &amp; giving people like you who make such a difference in our HoH community.

FYI just pushed an update to the play store for the Android 11 folks, should be out (hopefully) by tomorrow-ish.

* Fixed Transcription on Android 11 devices, works reliably on tested devices
* Resolved an issue that prevented the microphone from starting on certain Android 11 phones.
* Minor Performance improvements and bug fixes

Thanks for all the patience and feedback!

Is it possible to make Transcriboar available outside of Google Playstore?",2025-10-14 03:40:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o653ju/for_my_fellow_hoh_android_users_i_made_a_free_app/

hardofhearing,Living with reverse-slope hearing loss: worried about progression!,"Hey people!

I (28M) was diagnosed with RSHL (reverse slope hearing loss) about six years ago. My ENT identified a genetic factor as the main cause, and I got fitted with hearing aids right away. They've made a huge difference in my daily life, honestly, I can't imagine getting by without them.

I just had my yearly checkup today, and when we compared my recent audiogram to the one from four years ago, it showed a 15 dB drop in both ears. That was a bit unsettling to see. 

I'm wondering if anyone here has RSHL or a similar type of progressive genetic hearing loss. Have you noticed your hearing changing significantly over time? Is gradual decline something that tends to happen with this type of loss, or can it sometimes stabilise?

I know everyone's hearing journey is different, but I'd really appreciate hearing about your experiences. It's been on my mind a lot today, especially thinking of what things might look like in 15 years down the line if the rate of decline stays the same. 

Thanks for taking the time to read!!

hardofhearing,How hearing parents learn to connect after finding out their child is deaf or hard of hearing,"Hi everyone! I’m a grad student at Northwestern studying design, and my thesis focuses on how hearing parents learn to communicate and connect after finding out their child is deaf or hard of hearing.

I came across a few stories online that really stayed with me, and I wanted to understand more about what that experience is like from those who’ve lived it, whether as someone HoH or Deaf, a parent, or a teacher or interpreter who’s supported families in that stage.

I’m hoping to learn from real experiences, not to design *for* anyone, but to better understand what helps parents and kids connect and what makes that process harder. I know it’s a deeply personal topic, and I want to approach it with care and respect.

If you’re open to sharing, I’d be so grateful to hear your thoughts here or privately by DM if that feels more comfortable. Either way, thank you for taking the time to read this and for creating such a welcoming community.

I don’t really see where the design come in, since connection is about the human to human communication.

During the meeting with the microphone, the speakers did a terrible job of using it. So frustrating!

I had the live translation up on my phone and even that didn’t pick up everything. What to do about this situation?

I know it’s uncomfortable to do, but asking the speaker to use a microphone and use it correctly is valid. It’s will probably help others who are having a hard time hearing too.

For work? Think about what kind of reasonable accommodations would enable you to do your job (like getting the info in writing, research solutions for better live captions) and talk to your manager or HR about it.

In my country we can book CART for such events.

hardofhearing,I am a HOH teacher - are there any support groups for HOH/deaf educators?,"I am a first year educator with a hearing disability. I teach hearing students. I am having trouble policing talking as I can struggle to hear what exactly was said, who said it, and where the voice was coming from. I have talked to students about it. I am not seeing the changes I hoped for. Does anyone know of groups for teachers with disabilities that I could maybe join for support? A quick internet search has let me down - I don't seem to be able to find anything.

  


[댓글]
I don't know of any groups for HOH teachers, but I will share my experiences in the classroom as a HOH teacher. This seems more like a classroom management problem more than a HOH problem. The better your classroom management is, the less ""talking"" you are going to have to contend with. This isn't to say that ***you*** are doing things the wrong way, just that there are small changes that you can make to lessen the talking going on in your classroom.

* Set the expectations by enforcing noise levels. In my school we use the 3-0 scale. 3 is recess/assembly level, 2 is general talking/hallway levels, 1 is whisper (can only be heard by the person next to you), and 0 is no talking/noise at all. When we are in the classroom, the expectation is that noise levels do not raise above 1. Holding up a 0 or 1 is the signal for students to mirror your gesture and bring it down to that level. Hold up the 0 or 1 until all students have theirs raised.
* Use prompts like ""If you can hear the sound of my voice, clap once/clap twice"" at a low level and increase claps until the room is silent, or hold up your hand and count down from 5. At 1 the class should be silent. These work well with Proximity or the use of a microphone. Walk around the room so you know students can hear you in all parts of the room without the need to raise your voice.
* Reiterate these expectations every time you use these prompts, and be consistent. These are strategies that work at all grade levels. Also reiterate the expectation when you release students for individual or group work. ""We will be working in groups/individually. The expectation during this time is that the noise level will remain at a 1/0.""
* Proximity is a great way to get students to focus. If students are being too loud, go stand next to/over them. They quiet down pretty quickly when they have their teacher standing within inches of them. However if you are sitting at your desk or helping a student across the classroom, they are more likely to be talking loudly or goofing off.
* Use a microphone in the classroom hooked up to the classroom speakers or a bluetooth speaker while you are giving instruction. While it won't directly stop the talking going on during the lesson/lecture portion of your instruction, it will lessen it because now they are contending with the volume of your voice drowning out their own whispering.
* Keep students busy. If they are talking, this means they either don't have any work (they finished early), or the work they do have isn't mentally stimulating them enough to where they have to focus to complete the assignment. Additionally, set a time limit (with visual timers) for work you assign that is tight enough that students who aren't focusing will not be able to complete it in time.

Here is a good resource that has helped me improve my classroom management skills. It is a good read, and will only take an hour or 2 to read it: [https://archive.org/details/fredjonestoolsfo0000fred/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/fredjonestoolsfo0000fred/mode/2up)

You can read the entire book as long as you have a login for the site (just check the book out at the top.)

I would also recommend posting this in r/Teachers if you haven't already so you can get some advice from more seasoned teachers in the field.

I wish I could join a support club with you. I have exactly the same classroom management struggles.

i work in a deaf school so im not sure, but maybe assign a classroom job of “noise monitor”?

I’m a deaf (but use ha) teacher of high school age hearing students. A decade in, I’m over trying to police what they say. If they can say it where I don’t hear them then  it’s not my problem. They know I’m deaf and if they need me I have to see them and see their mouths. They learn quickly how to interact with me

I am a Deaf educator. I have a hearing TA but. I work in a school for the Deaf. My students are very helpful for figuring who or where noises came from if they saw or heard it too. 

I am sure there are a couple of others on here and r/deaf. Maybe I could create a facebook group.

I would love to join a group. I find this a struggle and I have a co-teacher who is hearing. It’s frustrating because I can’t hear them and I feel like they think I’m ignoring the students when we should be completely silent.

I used to teach High School to hearing students. It was a chore to police the use of cell phones since I am high frequency deaf. The students cought on that I did not hear the rings. Ugh. I just couldn't and ended up quitting. I hope it gets better and easier for you.

I am HoH and teach hearing University students. When they gave me a teaching role I was very clear that the struggle would be real, and they assured me I would be fine and then I wasn't. And on top of it I lost even more hearing towards the end of my first semester of teaching. Our disability services team couldn't link me up with any other HoH educators. The University has now put supports in place for me, like giving me much more lead in time to prepare, and becoming ok with me taking all of my tech everywhere.

I love your idea. Please set up a group.",2025-10-12 14:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o4qt3o/i_am_a_hoh_teacher_are_there_any_support_groups/
hardofhearing,reverse slope (low frequency loss) and hearing aids,"hi all. looking to get hearing aids after 10+ years of not having them. 

my issues in the past were that the background noise would be amplified, and mask any high frequency speech sounds that i could already hear making it harder to hear with the hearing aids on. 

i was curious how tech has changed in the last 10 years. are hearing aids beneficial to you?

[댓글]
Been wearing hearing aids since I was a toddler. Audiologists have this mindset of only following your audiogram, but you have the right to tell them that it’s not your preference and you need the sound brought forward or the speech levels need to be amplified, whatever. 

Trust me. I have had multiple confrontations with audiologists over the years over this. They need reminding that YOU are the user and what you need goes. Don’t be afraid to push back as hard as you need to. 

Other than that, I’ve been told hearing aid tech has improved immensely but I’m not sure how, other than we have bluetooth and rechargeable battery capabilities now. The downside is the programming tracks the frequency and length of the wearing period which gets me scolded because I never wear them alone, which is 99% of the time.

Anyway, find your IDGAF energy and an audiologist you like and get fitted. Lol. Happy wearing! :)

I had reverse slope hearing loss, though it's leveled off and is pretty flat these days, so take it with a grain of salt. That said, couple things:

1. It took time for my ears to adjust to the new sounds. Keyboard presses sounded like gunshots, the air conditioner was deafening. I got used to it only after wearing my HAs all day for several weeks straight - your brain has to adapt.
2. It took several rounds of programming to dial in the right settings. I visited my audiologist monthly or even twice a month for the first 6 months or so, then every three months after that for a couple years. It's amazing how much of a difference tuning makes.",2025-10-11 21:30:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o47dz3/reverse_slope_low_frequency_loss_and_hearing_aids/

Deaf people are already less likely to get into an auto crash. Maybe you could look o to accessibility devices to help hearing people drive better.

You don’t really need hearing to drive. In fact, one of the biggest prejudices there are about the Deaf community is that we can’t drive. I have personally participated in research that showed that we HoH and Deaf drive **more** safely than average, because of paying visual attention to the traffic better, for example a more consistent and appropriate use of rear mirrors, and so on. Your project therefore doesn’t really solve a problem, but rather contributes to cementing misconceptions.

Note, we don’t really need to communicate using speech when driving, we don’t need to hear what people say and we aren’t socially excluded when driving.

I’d recommend doing much more research before starting a project.

I went to the other post on the other thread that you shared and some of the comments were fantastic, advising you to find a lawyer and explaining step by step how much of an ADA violation this is as well as workplace retaliation and discrimination. Those are awesome. 

As a hard of hearing person, I am curious if they have provided any kind of accommodations in your classroom that may help? I am thinking... mirrors above the board and on the side of the board so you can see if a student is raising their hand when you're writing something. 

A strict policy of hand raising since you cannot follow random comments. 

I'm wondering if you would be allowed to have your phone on you and do speech to text when an incident is happening so you can have a transcript of what is said? Obviously, you will not be able to stare at your phone to keep up during the incident, but It can help when filing an incident report.   
  
I'm trying to think creatively. Obviously you won't get any fancy accommodations from admin who don't understand the nature of hearing loss. I'm just honestly stunned that a SCHOOL wouldn't provide... accommodations even for a teacher. That's wild to me. Do they have a disability services office? That's my own curious question.

Check with your states agency for deaf and hard of hearing for a caption device or phone. 

Check with your fire department for smoke alarms that flash a light.

Reading a message can be challenging too, depending on their ability to process/ read quickly. Some apps retain the written msg for review. Im using CaptionCall for calls, and a transcription app for irt meetings.

Caption Call is free

Innocaption is free for deaf/ hoh 
I think you might have to enter your  SSN to register. I forgot.  Its decent sometimes hit or miss

For face to face conversations in quiet environments, the captions built into any phones accessibility menu should be good enough. Paid services like otter.ai are more accurate. 

Is this a situation where they just need a little help or do they need adult care services? In the US, they can use IP relays, VRS (if they sign), or InnoCaption free of charge to make phone calls. Having adult children in the area does not mean they are capable of living on their own.

Android or IoS?

Android use live transcribe. I have an app that's basically an improved version of that hopefully in a few days or whenever the play store approves it, too.

hardofhearing,Hearing Aids Best for Heavy Sweating?,"I am going in for a hearing aid fitting/evaluation in a couple weeks to get a new pair. I had the fancy starkeys with all the Bluetooth this and this that for about 5 years and I HATE THEM. 

This time around I want some that are absolutely NOT Bluetooth capable and do not have *any* phone connectivity and are made for people who work outside and sweat, etc a LOT.

Are there any particular ones I should be looking at and thinking about? 

[댓글]
Talk to your audiologist about that. And for hearing aids to not be connected is totally fine. your audiologist will knkw how to help for both of those concerns. Fyi

You don't need to use the Bluetooth feature. Definitely not ReSound. Phonak managed sweat better.

Some of them are waterproof, or at least rated water resistant.

When I was a kid I think sweat did in one of my BTE aids.  More recently, my old Phonak would sometimes shut off when I got very sweaty but they'd turn back on when they dried out.

My current ones (Oticon) seem completely resistant to it.  I work a job where I'm sometimes very sweaty and they're basically sitting in pools of salt water for hours behind my ears and they're fine.  I wear them at the gym, too.

I used to worry about it but I decided to just not worry about it.  They're under a fairly comprehensive warranty.

Absolutely no phone connectivity may be a tough ask.  Almost all hearing aids have a T-coil receiver even if they don't have Bluetooth.  And almost all have Bluetooth, too, these days.

This is one of the reasons I went with in the ear. They are naturally protected from sweat and don't bounce around when I'm working out. Not an option for everyone, but I greatly prefer them.

My audiologist actually said Bluetooth options tend to be more waterproof because they don’t have any access points to the battery like the ones with a physical battery do.

Ooooh so you’re switching to rechargeable?

I switched from Signia to Phonak, and I LOVE them. Withstand heavy workouts much better than Signia. You will still have to give them maintenance though and more often because of the sweat. There's truly no brands out there that are sweat proof.",2025-10-08 01:33:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0xjgf/hearing_aids_best_for_heavy_sweating/

He said it could take 12 weeks from the surgery date for my hearing to be normal, but I’m at about 15 weeks now and I’m still hearing a lot of internal noise when I open/close my jaw. My voice also sounds really loud in that ear when I talk. I have a hearing test scheduled in a few weeks, but I’m starting to panic since I haven’t noticed any improvement in the last month. Has anyone else experienced this, and did it resolve? Thanks!

I had tympanoplasty on left ear on 23 July 2024
I had no internal voices before the surgery and it began immediately when I was awake after the surgery 
I am from India and this was the same with me what you are going through
When I open my mouth wide from left to right - the internal voice increases
The voice is more like an eeeeeeee
I have habituated to this but its like really annoying, don’t know what causes it
But hang in there - You will ignore this too",2025-10-08 00:40:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0weh8/tympanoplasty_recovery_question/
hardofhearing,New Signia hearing aids making me crazy! 😵‍💫,"I just got hearing aids for the first time. The left one, that is. I’ve always semi joked that my left ear canal was deformed because I could never get regular in-ear speakers (can’t remember actual name) to fit.

This left one will not seat properly. We’ve tried a large dome, a smaller dome, and the one you see in the picture. It’s always loosening in my ear canal, especially when I’m eating. It’s making me just crazy!!! The right ear is seated just right and doesn’t loosen at all. I need to go back to the hearing center. But first, what are your thoughts?

My ears are so tiny internally that they used the kids dome from a different set. Look into it!

Why not get the custom earmolds? They'll be exact to your ear canal that way

I got custom made molds. I could not stand the domes. My hearing aids are receiver in the ear too.

Maybe you and your audiologist can look into Grip Tips? I know Oticon makes a few sizes and maybe they would fit on your Signia hearing aids? I was having so many fit issues this year with my new hearing aids and this is what I landed on. They’re kind of an in-between of domes and custom ear molds. They’re almost sticky feeling and as they warm up in your ear they really grip on and don’t move around like domes do.

Molds are the way to go, as long as it's an option with that style receiver. I had a trial pair one time with domes, they would pull off the receiver and get stuck in my ear all the time. I would use this tiny pair of eyeglasses tweezers to fish them out of my ears.

I’m somewhat like that with my right. It won’t seal. I have tiny ear canals and get wax plugs easily

Audiologist here. If you were my patient I'd add a retention tail. When my patients are between sizes I go with the larger size and cut 1 or 2 slits in it to make it ""tulip"" and then you've made a dome that's between sizes. If none of that worked, we'd be talking about custom molds.

Depending on your insurance custom ear molds might be the answer for you. My ears are tiny as well and the only thing that worked for me are custom ear molds. The feedback went away when I got them.

For years my domes slipped out and I didn’t know any better.  I was told there was one size larger they could use.  When it first went inside t was a bit uncomfortable and took me about a week to get used to it.  But I now don’t have them coming out anymore.  Maybe if the kid ones don’t help you you could try this.

I suggest custom earmolds. Because they'll be custom-made to your ear, you won't have any problems.",2025-10-07 21:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0s3dc/new_signia_hearing_aids_making_me_crazy/
hardofhearing,Lipreading and Auditory Training,"In 1950s, more rehabilitation was offered for hearing loss through the VA. It not only included hearing aids but auditory training and lipreading practices. In the 70s, that fell by the wayside and the focus became more about hearing technology. By the 90s, lipreading just about disappeared.

I've had hearing loss since the mid 80s and got my first pair of hearing aids in the early 90s. Back then, it was analog hearing aids and boy did I struggle with them. What I didn't know at the time was that hearing aids didn't fix my kind of hearing loss. I also didn't know about hearing aid limits back then so background noise continued to be a huge problem in my work environment. I had coworkers say things like, ""Are your ears on,"" when I couldn't understand them. Or the hated, ""Turn up your hearing aids!"" During those years, I thought something was wrong with me. 

Hearing aid limits: They work best within 6 feet. Even though they are better than ever (I love my digital hearing aids over those old analogs), it still interferers. Harsh acoustics with reverberation also impact the usefulness of hearing aids. I didn't learn that until after 17 years of hearing aid use. If I had known, I could created workarounds way back in the 90s. 

After a big drop in hearing going into the severe range (high frequency hearing loss), I had to learn to communicate all over again. I also lost my career at this point because I couldn't cope in noisy environments and there weren't as many accommodations as there are today.  

After two years of feeling like I was in a hole, I did climb out with persistence and determination. I started to teach lipreading for the D/HH state agency, among other hearing loss related classes. I found lipreading to be most helpful because it taught me how to advocate for myself and evaluate communication situations. Now I teach for [Hearing Loss LIVE!](https://hearinglosslive.com/lipreading-classes/) and I have a class this Saturday for the strategies that go with lipreading. Strategies are must because 60 to 70 percent of speech is NOT visible. We need workarounds. Lip shapes are only one of the tools of lipreading and I can teach the visible shapes too, with a class on Oct 25th.

Lipreading aside, auditory training is important too. Over two years ago, I got my first Bluetooth hearing aids. Wow! After not listening to audio books most of my life, I dipped my toe in with these hearing aids in. At first I kept the [built-in smartphone captions](https://hearinglosslive.com/smartphone-built-in-accessibility-for-hearing-loss/) on to help me with the listening. After enough practice, I was able to let go of the captions. The trick was using my hearing aid app to slide out ambient/environmental noise.  I miss words from time to time but I can usually puzzle it out at some point. After a few years of this, I realized auditory training has improved my comprehension. So there really is something to the full rehabilitation the VA offered many years ago. I highly encourage this practice now with podcasts and audiobooks if you don't already do this. Just make sure the narrators/speakers don't have an accent, they talk one at a time, have a steady pace and no background noise. I'm choosy what I listen to and it helps. 

We don't hear things like this from most hearing professionals. It comes from hardcore personal experience.  Thought I'd share a couple of tips to help. Also, use the [Three Golden Rules](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/) with everyone. That alone helped me a lot year ago when I discovered that made all the difference for me.

Great points.  I have been avoiding audiobooks but I can see the benefits uf using them.

There is no scientific proof that auditory training helps. Getting use to a CInis a different thing, with hearing aids you simply lack the input.

Lip reading might be ok for emergencies, when other options aren’t available, but I feel you should be advocating for skills that do offer us 100% of what’s said without effort, instead of 30% with a great cognitive effort. Why should we waste our cognition on just listening, instead of using it to actually process the information itself. CART, captioning and sign language provide so much more efficient access to speech, and we deserve it.",2025-10-07 17:43:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0loz4/lipreading_and_auditory_training/
hardofhearing,Do you notice as well people being hard of hearing?,"Hello there, I'm hard of hearing and got my first pair 5 years ago, and since then I did notice some of people I suspect being hoh. Do you notice the same or it's because I got my diag quite early? Here is things I notice in their behavior.

\-They often ask me to repeat.

\-They ""stare me"" like it's being more confortable to hear me due to lip reading (without noticing?)

\-They also speak louder than other people, and when we watch tv, often ask me to higher the sound.

Do you notice this behavior on other people and if so do you speak about hearing loss? A friend of mine decided to test themself to see if their hearing is right.

I feel like before this I did not notice this behavior because I was quite on denial.

Take care of yourself!

Yeah all the time. HoH people often show the same masking techniques. Iykyk

Aye, it's pretty noticable.

I got a lovely new boss a few years ago and I realised she was deaf by the end of her first week, whereas some of our team still have no idea. She couldn't hear anything going on behind her which is the biggest giveaway for me :D We're a good combo. My desk faces into the room so I alert her when someone wants her and in return, she handles accents for me lmao.

I also seem to be able to identify hearing aids at fifty paces. Even just walking down the street, I'll notice if someone walking past has got a hearing aid. I love seeing them! I was the only deaf kid at school and the only deaf adult I knew was my grandad. Now I go to work and there are deaf students and other deaf staff and I don't feel alone any more.

I’ve suspected I may have less than great hearing, because if someone isn’t looking at me I struggle to make out what they are saying, and noticed I didn’t hear as well during covid when people were wearing masks. I also ask people to repeat things, and then smile and nod if I feel like I’ve asked too many times.

Yes, especially if they're a lipreader. I've also noticed the other signs you mentioned.

Same here. They say hearing loss is invisible but to those in the know, we know. I instantly recognize it as I talk to people too.

What does masking mean?

Yeah, I do. I've been wearing mine for 7 years, and somehow found more people with mild hearing loss, thanks to mine.

I've telling my neighbor that her child is HoH for several years. She honestly gets offended.

About three months ago they went to an ENT and audiologist.

He has hearing loss and a speech therapist now. 🥲

Also, I have an employee who I've worked with off and on for over a decade.

About a month ago she found out I was HoH for the first time in a hilarious exchange where she realized how many times she's heard me say ""I can't hear you"". 😆",2025-10-07 14:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0guay/do_you_notice_as_well_people_being_hard_of_hearing/

I’m hard of hearing, wear hearing aids, was in special ed, and am now 40, married to a smart, hot wife, we have kids, a house, happiness, and I have a kick ass career. 

You got this, bro.

High school is not forever don’t judge your entire future based off it.

Hey man you got this. Women are attracted to guys who believe in themselves to get through adversity. You are doing that everyday. You are using something that helps you, the hearing aids and that’s a plus because you are resourceful and not afraid to get help. 

Most people can’t see hearing aids so it’s not a big deal.

16 yr old F HOH here in gen ed class: high school aint forever, once you start trolling the hearies then life is bright :)

22F here, some girls may not like you for those two things but some will. People can be ignorant, girls are not a monolith and can be awful people too. Everyone will not like you. 

But! There are girls who will 100% accept you for those two things. I’ve learned with dating that it isn’t about me impressing them, getting them to like me but figuring out if I like them. You deserve someone who accepts you for who you are.

hardofhearing,how to explain my hearing to friends/classmates,"Some context to begin with, i struggle with low frequencies rather than high ones, and im on a months long wait list to see an audiologist to figure out how much hearing i have and what type of loss. My GP agrees that i have some level of loss, and that hearing aids may be helpful for me, but i dont know how bad my hearing is nor have access to aids yet. I struggle with conversations even in quiet environments unless the other person is louder, next to me, and facing me, and it has to be just the one person so i can focus on them. I only hear the higher pitched sounds of rain, and even at its heaviest rain is quiet for me. I can only really hear things comfortably when its loud, singular things to focus on, and in a quiet environment.   
I'm not even sure if its a loss at all, as my hearing has always been this way since i was  little, im now 20, but as i was neglected i never saw a doctor from what im aware of. My parents often complained about my ""selective"" hearing, and i have never really been much of an out loud talker from what i now know was social fatigue from being autistic, and listening fatigue making conversations especially difficult and taxing. I also struggle to speak in general as i trip over words, and according to my flatmate i apparently have a lisp and audibly struggle to say letters that i coincidentally also struggle to hear. I was put into a BSL club when i was a kid so i can do basic signs and fingerspelling, but we're not really sure if i was there just because it was available or if i was having visible issues or delays.  
  
I'm now finally in a college course and in a place where i have the energy for it, but im really struggling with communicating with my friends and classmates out loud. Its an art course and the majority of us are autistic/adhd, so when i explain that i cant hear very well or am hard of hearing they tend to go ""oh me too! i struggle to process words, i always go what? whenever someone is repeating what theyve said for me!"". And i get it i really do, but they arent seeming to understand that its not what i mean. And ive already noticed people looking at me funny as i assume ive missed them talking to me, or completely ignored them because ive had to focus on the lecturer speaking. So saying im hard of hearing just isnt explaining enough anymore, but i dont want to have to completely explain my experience just so people finally start speaking up to me. I've thought about saying im d/Deaf, as it has been since i was a child and i would rather use BSL if i had people that knew it, but as we dont know my level of loss yet im not sure im comfortable or right in doing so.   


It's a tough situation for me rn, but i have these classmates for at least this school year and the next, and I may not be seen by audiology until February. I'm also not sure if hearing aids would even be useful if they are offered as i expect i will be very overwhelmed with sound.

[댓글]
Say you're hard of hearing but unfortunately don't have your hearing aids yet, and ask them to speak up/speak to you from the front/whatever helps. Mentioning the aids should make clear that it is indeed a physical problem without you having to explain your whole life?

I do that when I'm too lazy to put mine in (I say I forgot lol) because I didn't expect to talk to people XD

PS: if you have good care they will gradually, and with you in team, adjust the aids so you aren't swamped with sound right away. Well worth it :)

I also struggle with low frequencies, but I didn't lose my hearing until last year. It's been a huge adjustment. I just got my hearing aids in May, but I couldn't hear in September, and now I'm in a PhD program. I'm just super honest with people. 


I worried about people not understanding when I said hard of hearing so I would say, ""hey sorry I'm deaf, I didn't catch that. Can you face me?"" Etc. 


Even if I've told people before and they forget, I just try to remind them and keep it lighthearted. I'm in a lab with loud machines, so I just blame them. I always go. ""Sorry, whenever the centrifuge is running all my hearing aids pick up is the machine, can you repeat that?"" 


Everyone I mention it to it super supportive and understanding. People don't mean to be rude, they just genuinely forget a lot. Especially if you're good at keeping up by lip-reading/hearing aids most of the time.

So I’ve been hard of hearing my whole life. I learned to mask so well in social situations even when I miss parts of conversations.  The best thing to do is be honest and say that you didn’t hear something and ask them to please speak up or face you as they are talking. And I agree with mentioning that you’re in the process of getting aids and you have a really hard time hearing without them. Also since you’re in college have you looked into getting accommodations to help? When you go to the audiologist definitely mention it. They can give you a microphone that the professor wears and it amplifies their voice and helps you not strain your ears so much trying to listen to what they are saying.

hardofhearing,Anniversary of my Hearing Aid (humor),"Feeling a bit sentimental - I've officially had a hearing aid for a year to help my moderate low frequency hearing loss. It's been quite a year of learning, being a better advocate for myself, and navigating the grief.

I'm a young woman working in engineering, with many, many soft-spoken men. Probably one of the worst combinations with my particular flavor of loss (fortunately the hearing aid helps tremendously). Part of the learning and advocacy has been figuring out where the silver linings and humor lie.

So please enjoy my lifelong friend's immediate reaction to learning about my loss - I still pull up this screenshot on the dark days.

hardofhearing,BAHA issue,"Good morning everyone. Just looking to get some advice and see if anyone has had a similar issue. 

I’m 31 and a few years ago had to have a mastoidectomy on both sides to resolve an issue. As a result the hearing loss in both ears was significantly reduced. As of August this year I recently had BAHA surgery. Currently waiting for my switch on to get the hearing aids attached. 

The issue I’m having is that the left bolt has completely slipped out leaving a small hole in my head. I went to A&amp;E over the weekend, got seen by an ENT doctor who has advised that I call my audiologist department that fitted my implants. I’m currently waiting on a call back. 

I’m just curious has anyone that has had a BAHA had the bolt slip out before? I’ve followed all instructions. Don’t touch it etc so I’m quite baffled at how it has just quite literally slipped out. My panic is that this will happen again. 

Any advice would be most kindly appreciated and hope you all have a great day! 

[댓글]
Yeah it happened before to me. I remember the doctor saying to me that I can’t be hit on the head or else the abutment would get loose and fall out. I eventually got hit once on the head so I had to go get the surgery again a couple months later.",2025-10-06 08:52:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nzdusd/baha_issue/

hardofhearing,Am I certain to be deaf now?,"I have been clubbing for once a week or once a month for the last 6 months. Have never done it before.

I will not be doing any clubbing anymore is what I have vowed to myself. I hope that all the damage that I did to my ears in the last 6 months will get recovered in due time as I stop exposure to loud music. I have so far been to clubs for 25 times this year for an average 3.5 hours per session. The music I would say was loud for hald of that time. The res of the time it stays quite medium.  

[댓글]
I think it’s a little more complicated than that so the short answer is no.

If you lose hearing I highly doubt the club would be the sole issue. Both of my siblings went to the club once a week for years and neither has a hearing issue. If you’d like to keep going clubbing and reduce the potential for hearing loss caused my loud noise use earplugs.

I think if 3 hours of loud music 1-4 times a month guaranteed deafness, there would be a lot more deaf people in the world. You’re fine. Wear some earplugs when you’re at the club to protect yourself and ease up that anxiety.

you should be fine. it takes years of exposure so if your going deaf its certainly not that alone if that at all. it would be more like daily for 6 months to make any sense. but use noise reduction earplugs made for concerts going forward to reduce risk and youll be fine.",2025-10-05 20:32:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nyz8qp/am_i_certain_to_be_deaf_now/
