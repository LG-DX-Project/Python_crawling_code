1oy15nu,hardofhearing,Anyone else get extra bothered by loud noises?,"I became HOH around 2-3 months ago and one of the things I noticed is that loud sounds irritate me a lot more. I hate loud music, loud clattering, anything loud. Went to the club for Halloween and regretted it heavily lol. Ironically, when my parents speak loud to me to get me to hear it irritates me heavily... I find myself using the noise suppression on my hearing aids quite often.

Anyone else relate to this? Why could this be?

yeeeup. i’ve been losing my hearing steadily ever since I spent years in marching band, shit was way too loud for my teenybopper ears. 😭 I have to wear earplugs at work when I do dishes because the plates clattering feel like scissors in my ear canals.

Lost my hearing when I was 3 and I’m now 35. A club has always sucked. I can read lips but it’s *so annoying* to hear nothing over the music.

i think with noise induced hearing loss its entirely possible your injury can cause pain with loud sounds, and thsoe with hearing loss lose the sound buffers we have. all of the hairs in my cochlea that both booths quiet sounds and dampen the louder ones are gone. my acoustic reflexes are also gone, which is what protects a healthy ear from loud sounds

I definitely am. I'm reasonably certain it's because I'm autistic. I wore hearing aids age 12-18, and when no one could make me wear them anymore, I stopped. I just picked up my new ones yesterday (age 31) and remembered immediately why I stopped. Even with the upper volume threshold lowered (the hearing aid techs can do this btw!) I was overstimulated to the point of a full meltdown within four hours. 

The thing I kept thinking the whole time was ""damn, why does *everything* need to make sound? Why can't some things just be silent?"" Frankly, if it wasn't for the benefits to communication and brain health, I wouldn't have gotten new hearing aids at all. My hearing loss is a blessing in the face of my auditory avoidance.",2025-11-15 19:52:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oy15nu/anyone_else_get_extra_bothered_by_loud_noises/
1oxx86o,hardofhearing,Ear Distortion Got Better but Not Gone What Could This Be?,"I’m 15 and last week I suddenly started getting this weird *robotic/buzzy distortion* in my **left ear** whenever I heard sounds. It lasted about 2–3 days and then mostly went away, but my hearing still isn’t completely normal.

Here’s what’s still happening:

* Sounds in my left ear still feel **slightly low-pitched**, especially noticeable in things like my OnePlus Buds Pro boot-up sound
* Occasionally the robotic distortion comes back for a some time
* I have a mild cold, and now I also notice a very faint **“fluid moving” sound** in my **right ear**, but only when I really focus
* My right ear otherwise seems fine
* No injury, nothing loud happened that day, it was a normal day
* I use earbuds regularly but never had this issue before

Last week’s robotic sound scared me a bit, even though it went away. I’m just wondering if this is something like fluid/pressure from my cold and if it can fix itself, or if I should see a doctor/ENT. =

Has anyone had something similar? Should I be concerned that some symptoms are still hanging around?

Yes generally if  you’re having a health issue you should see a health care provider. That being said  if you have a cold it may be worth waiting for that to subside and then assessing if you need to see a dr. Having a cold impacts the ears nose and throat so it’s possible that’s the issue",2025-11-15 17:16:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxx86o/ear_distortion_got_better_but_not_gone_what_could/

Forget your HAs from your bluetooth settings and set them up again as a new set. That usually fixes it.

It is totally wrong to think you are worthless just because of a hearing problem. How old are you? When I was in middle school, I lacked confidence because I wore hearing aids, and my life was a mess. Even in China, where long hair is not allowed for boys in school , I grew my hair long to cover them up. I tried my best to avoid socializing because I thought people would laugh at my hearing aids. Instead of worrying about your irreversible hearing issue, try to improve the things you can change. From my experience, most people don’t actually care about your hearing aids. Sure, they might talk about them occasionally, but most of the time, they’re just being kind and want to understand your situation. If someone laugh at you, just ignore them, or like me punched them. I have been watching a lot of posts from reddit and other platforms to seek for other experience. Only conclusion I can find is be confident. Confidence changed my high school life. If you still struggle to make new friends, I can tell you that social skills are *really* important.  
All I want to say is you have a lot of things to improve on,don’t struggle with something you can’t change.

I'm so sorry you’re feeling sad, worthless, and hopeless. You’re not alone in experiencing those feelings, and many people feel this way at some point in their lives. I’ve personally felt that way. The good news is that feelings are transient, and help is available for times when we feel stuck in unpleasant emotions or situations. 

Have you spoken to your doctor or to a therapist? I’m neither a doctor nor a therapist, but it sounds as if you may be experiencing [depression or major depressive disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007). If so, the PHQ-9 is a [simple diagnostic tool](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1725/phq9-patient-health-questionnaire9) that can provide you with a sense of your level of depression. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself, it’s important that you call the [988 Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org) right away. The Lifeline has [options for deaf and hard of hearing individuals](https://988lifeline.org/deaf-hard-of-hearing-hearing-loss/). Depression hurts, but there’s treatment available to ease the pain. 

Your first step is to make an appointment with your primary care physician for a physical to make sure you’re healthy and that there are no underlying causes for your depression. Your doctor may be able to recommend a therapist in your area, and s/he may also recommend pharmaceutical treatment(s) for depression. Sometimes the brain needs extra help in getting out of a mental or emotional rut. Next schedule an appointment with a therapist. If you can’t find a therapist in your area, [DeafLead](https://deaflead.org/services/mental-health-services/) may be able to help. 

Please know that you matter and that you’re infinitely valuable. You’re also a stronger person than you know. Nature has given you all the resources you need to survive and thrive. You will feel better with time and treatment. Please don’t give up. Happiness is not beyond your reach.

1oxj2qv,hardofhearing,Did getting hearing aids change how social you are?,"Before I got my hearing aids, I didn’t realize how much I avoided having conversations.
I’d smile, nod, and hope I was responding at the right time but inside I was always
anxious I’d misheard something. Over time, I stopped joining group chats or going to
noisy places because it just felt exhausting trying to keep up.

After getting my hearing aids, I was able to follow along without guessing. This has
honestly changed how social I am, I feel more confident speaking up or even just
hanging out without worrying I’ll miss half the conversation.

No. That's never happened. Hearing aids *always* pick up unwanted background noise.

Every family gathering last year had me basically saying nothing and not really interacting a lot, because of all the extra noise making it virtually impossible for me to actually meaningfully participate in the social aspect of these events.

Anytime I'm anywhere and someone wants to socialize with me, it never seems to be quiet enough. A refrigerator can be too distracting. I go to the bar, the store, the coffee shop, or the bank (of all places) and some idiot just *has* to have the radio on.

If anything, even after 30 years of wearing hearing aids (I'm 37), I long for the quiet solitude of just being able to watch Netflix (which has CC) or YouTube (usually with a Bluetooth headset).

Hearing aids do more to improve my quality of life than any other health remedy or appliance! No clueless smiling-and-nodding. No failure to engage for fear of misunderstanding or social faux pas. Renewed satisfaction in being a real-time interactive part of family gatherings and intimate moments.

Yes. HAs helped me reenter life!

i would say yes, mostly. i love my phonaks. the settings do well to tune out background noise in social settings. i also get to enjoy music again which is a huge part of my life and something that connects my circle of friends. i’ve done a lot less smile and nodding.

Hearing aides don't work for me, but with learning ASL and visiting Deaf spaces I've had a similar experience. I'm enjoying the company of other people for the first time and having a blast!

You’re lucky, my hearing is too poor for that.

Pretty much everything! Conversations that would get skipped due to fear of non-hearing started happening, brought a lot of extroversion too.

No, not really I think. Although I’m much more responsive instead of saying “what?” or “huh?” all the time or not even responding at all

No, I can just hear better

I would love to know from OP and the other people who say their hearing aids have helped, which hearing aids they have? Because mine are useless with background noise but I've got basic ones and I'm hoping to save up and get something a bit fancier.

Well, I can interact better with others, so in a way, yes. But not completely, because I was born hard of hearing and I'm very much in my own world.

We all have our issues with HA. A lot depends on the degree of loss we have and including tinnitus. My hearing loss is severe and HA (Phonak) have literally saved me from severe depression. I’m unable to hear music, but I have been able to get by in every day living. Background noise is our biggest nemesis, and the industry has made some headway with AI chips.

I wish. I really miss being social. HAs don’t help me in group settings. Most of my interactions are online, and limited at that. 😞",2025-11-15 05:04:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxj2qv/did_getting_hearing_aids_change_how_social_you_are/

I've owned a couple of sets with BT and never had this problem.  If it happens with different media on different devices like tv and computer, maybe it's using an older version of Bluetooth, or maybe it's using the latest Bluetooth but the processor can't quite handle it properly?

I’ve struggled with this for most of my life, for some background info, I’m a woman and almost 40 and have a hearing loss. I am well educated and hold a job and own my own home. 

I find it hard to make friends that take me seriously or don’t seem to comprehend that I have understanding of human depth and conversations. I am socially awkward due to my hearing loss and have missed a lot on social cues growing up. I have some friends and good ones but the ones I am unsure about, they seem to be surface level friends- not meeting me halfway or understanding me or making an effort. (Don’t get me wrong, with my hearing devices I hear perfectly clear and communicate just fine) but they seem more surface level and just meh. I feel like sometimes I’m a filler friend like an option if no one else is around. Are these people just fake acquaintances? I have a hard time reading social cues as well.

I am currently in therapy figuring out my shit- working on being healthier and making healthier choices and learning my own self worth. But it only seems to solve my problems as it is on my own, but hasn’t seemed to improve my social life. Does anyone have any tips to just let this go and focus on oneself?

Sorry if this all sounds like a midlife crisis- but I’m so tired. 😪

If anyone has any motivating advice or inspiration, please send them my way. 🤟🏼

I'm 57. I've been wearing aids since I was 23. For the longest time I had only hearing friends, which is good. Some understand better than others, that's for sure. When my hearing dropped the last time, two hearing friends didn't fully understand my new communication issues and I had to let it all go and that was hard. I don't know if you have any local hearing loss support groups but that's helped me in the end. They validate my experiences. 

I've been talking about confidence and self-esteem the last week or so on other social media. If you're on LinkedIn, my posts is open to anyone (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelle-wyatt-a410b7233/). It is hard to have confidence with hearing loss, doubting whether or not we heard right or not. Plus people have so many misconceptions about hearing loss. That's the part I'm always correcting.

Hi. 

You took a page from my diary, typed it and called it your own! 🤭🙃🥰🫣 

You are far from alone. 

(I write this while sitting in my car after hiking, watching the sun set. Alone. )

If you’d like to talk/txt/be pen pals, please reach out. I’ve found that the more I talk with those who have walked the path similar to mine, the more we understand each other. I went through my entire life thinking I was broken; I didn’t know anyone else like me. I was living in a very small town, my parents had the best intentions but they kept me isolated (severely) and I never got the chance to go out into the real world until I was in my 30’s. It was…SHOCKING. 

It still is. 

I’m now 44. I have went from hearing aides to a Cochlear Implant, which was the best thing I have ever done in my life. I have been a Cochlear mentor for about 3 years; I went from being the person who viewed my hearing loss as my deepest darkest secret. I hid it at all costs; it was the shame that undid me. Now? I’m proud of my path. I’m one of the, if not the biggest advocates for @CochlearAmerica 
I tell everyone the truth about life with hearing loss, deadness, and how it affects not only you but everyone else around you. Hearing loss is a one way street, fast track to early onset of dementia. Cochlear gave me a chance to learn how to live AGAIN. This time? I hear so much that I have never heard before. 
Fortunately/Unfortunately. 
Ha! 

Please, reach out. 
You are not alone.

1ox2x78,hardofhearing,How often do you end up charging your hearing aids during,"I’ve been thinking about upgrading soon, but I’m curious how people handle charging routines. I know most newer models are rechargeable now, but do they realistically last a full day with normal use, especially if you stream music or take calls through Bluetooth? Please let me know how your experience has been with rechargeable hearing aids.

[댓글]
battery life for mine (phonak) is the whole day, 9am-10pm give or take and i only charge them when i’m sleeping. on the plus side, if you forget to charge them overnight i find that charging them just for 20-30 minutes gets me through 5-6 hours. I’m constantly listening to music through them, and find it doesn’t affect the battery life. my last hearing aids (first of rechargeable/bluetooth model) lasted me a little more than 4 years until battery was basically gone

Yes, they absolutely last a full day. I've had mine for two years and they last for 14-16hrs even with heavy (like, 8-10 hours) of streaming. 

I've only had them die before I could put them in their charging case maybe... three or four times over the past two years? It's been great. 

But yeah... without streaming, I imagine they'd probably last two full days. They're absolutely not like iphones.

I work 12 hours shifts for work. I use batteries now but back when I had rechargeable I’d throw them in at 5am, and by 7-8pm they would be dying. So for me, did not last a full day. As a guy in his 30’s doing shift work I did not like the rechargeables and switched back to battery.

I've had Resound Quattros for at least 6 years now. I only recharge them at night. They're usually still at 75% battery when I put them on the charger.


I do maybe an hour total of streaming/calls each day.

Most HAs now will last for 30-50ish hours. I wear my Phonak sphere 90s from about 7am to midnight every day and they're usually at 60-70% battery still when I go to charge them. I stream a ton and use the sphere mode a ton. 

I had Oticon More 1s before those and I would typically get about 1.5 days of use out of them before needing to charge. It's a non-issue these days.

Only one time in three years have I ever had a low battery warning from my hearing aids. I must have been streaming very heavily that day.

Mine are 3 years old and still holding a full day charge. I *did* completely forget that I would need to charge them while we were flying overnight from the US to Iceland, so after landing, I had to charge them in the terminal while we waited for our shuttle.

I charge my Jabras every night

Mine can last several days without a charge. I try to charge it every other day if not every day

My last hearing aids were Kirkland brand and they were the first generation of rechargeable. The battery sucked. I have long days (6-11) and they would start to die between 3-6 pm depending on how much Bluetooth I used (usually a lot). 

My new hearing aids are ReSound. The battery is amazing. I can stream all day and they have tons of power left at night. Also the charging dock holds battery so if you can't plug into an outlet you can just set them in the case and they'll recharge quickly. However, their water resistance sucks (I had to get them fixed by the manufacturer after only 3 months due to a sweaty workout) and I've had a lot of issues with the Bluetooth. My next set will be Phonak and I'm never getting anything other than that.

Oticon Intent. On workdays I take them out of the charger at around 7 am, listen to music and podcasts, make calls all day. At 10 pm they are still at around 30 % charge. 

Age is about 1 year.

My Widex Moments last a full day, unless it's a heavy Bluetooth usage day.  I put them in the charger when I go to sleep around 10-ish and take them out of the charger when I wake up at 5....

I had to upgrade to a stronger hearing aid so now have battery powered but my old was a rechargeable phonak and lasted me one day easily. Sometimes two days since I never used the music or calls (couldn’t hear them clearly enough).

I have oticon HAs and wear them an average of 3/4 hours a day (I have sensory problems, and wearing them for a long time is too much). I usually only charge them once a week. To be fair, I do have a charging case and I just put them back in there each time instead of putting them in the regular case, so they're always at 100% each use, and the case holds about 3 full charges. They definitely last longer than my battery HAs did.

I've got Phonak rechargeables for a mild to profound bilateral loss, put them in around 7-8 am and they last me until 9/10 pm. use them for Bluetooth pretty consistently throughout the day (laptop, phone calls, music, etc). but I normally take them out by 4pm cuz I'm done hearing lol

Mine, Oticon Intent 4, last about 20 hours.

I charge mine at night and the charge lasts for the whole day. Every once in a while they disconnect from charging and I have to charge them. Rare tho

I have \~5 year old Resound Quattros and they still last 18-20 hours/day.

I stream a lot. My Phonak hearing aid is good for 7 hours of continuous streaming.

My phonaks usually run out of batteries around 21-22 in the evening.  Which is usually OK as I'm winding down but very impractical with a social life.
Ideally I would allow them 30 minutes of charging in the afternoon on those days.

If I use them for audio a lot they run out an hour to three earlier. 
I usually charge them at night and out them in just before leaving the house in the morning (around 7).

I get a full day, 7a–10.30p listening to music almost the whole time. The amount of amplification does make a difference—my right ear is much deafer than my left ear and I can see the difference in battery level easily, but just checking right now, it’s 5p and I have over 75% battery in both HAs (although they’re also relatively new since I just replaced them last month).",2025-11-14 17:32:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ox2x78/how_often_do_you_end_up_charging_your_hearing/

1ow97e7,hardofhearing,Hearing parent with HOH child,"Hello all!

I am a mom of a newly diagnosed child (2F) with moderate hearing loss. She has a genetic condition called Marshalls Syndrome, that causes progressive hearing loss. We are working on getting hearing aids ordered and have seen all the medical professionals  (Audiology, ENT, etc).

We are already plugged in with TEIS (TN early intervention) and have seen a Social worker. My husband and I both work full time and She goes to daycare full time. 

  
Mainly I am posting because I have no idea what I am doing.  No one in my or my husbands family have gone through this process and we feel so alone. People in our circle are supportive, but they just don't understand as most of our friends don't even have kids, let alone one with a disability. 

  
Any insight would be helpful. Also, any recommendation for support groups or assistance would be appreciated as well. We are just lost and need guidance. &lt;3

[댓글]
Connecting with early intervention is a good thing. Encourage ASL and spoken english equally. Check out r/podc.

*hugs* 

You could see if there is an active hands &amp; voices program near you. 

Gallaudet has extension offices, not sure if there is one in TN, but if there is contact them. Shared Saturday Reading is an amazing experience. 

StartASL has ASL1 for free online.

I know it would be a big trip and investment if it were a good fit for your child, but our experience doing cochlear implants at Boston Children's was outstanding. We hesitated going through with it, and now that it's done we wish we had done it much earlier. 

I also recommend looking up wrights Law and getting their books. They are THE go to lawyers and advocates for special education. If they ever do an in person training near you I highly recommend it.

I'm HoH myself (100% deaf in left ear, severe-profound in right ear).

Depending on where you are, there may regularly held social events for Deaf/HoH people. Those can go a very long way to not only help you and your husband, but especially your daughter so she sees others just like her. It's likely to be at a place similar to, say, BW-3's (that's where I used to go to one all the time where I live). It's also a fantastic way to learn sign language and getting help because all of you will be totally immersed in that environment. It might be overwhelming at first, but I promise everyone there will be so eager to help!

HOH child here! Definitely do both English and sign language. Join deaf communities. You are not alone in this. There’s a lot more of us out there than you think and a lot of support!

Two of my sister's kids have genetic hearing loss so she's a few years ahead of you. 


My suggestions:


1. Reach out to your local nonprofit(s) for Deaf and HoH people and ask them to connect you with resources. Often there are more resources available  than most people are aware of. 
2. Start her learning accessible tech, languages, and devices before she needs them. For my nephew, it was a lot easier for him to adjust  to a hearing assist device in school because he wasn't having to figure it out and try to follow  along in class at the same time. 
3. Read up about  disability protection in your jurisdiction.  IME, as a child who had chronic medical disabilities growing up, if you don't know your/your kid's rights, you/your kid *will* get screwed over by folks who don't  care about  your rights (I could go into detail about my numerous near misses as a kid with brittle asthma, but I'll spare you. Suffice to say I know from experience that if you're not looking out for her, nobody is).

(Hug)

  
As a hearing Mom who raised two HOH kids, I wanted to chime in.  First of all, lots of good resources suggested. Just be proactive in your area and keep asking questions to get plugged in to what's available.

  
The path we took involved having our kids aided during all waking hours (except showers and swimming pools). I know it's hard when they're little, just do your best. My kids had hearing aids fitted when they were infants. Our goal was to have it feel weird to them when they aren't wearing the hearing aids since that is so crucial to development. 

  
And then talk, talk, talk. When I ran out of material I turned to books. We read books everywhere. On the floor, in the tub, in the car, on the sofa, in bed. The books became friends, but were really a gateway to language. Language acquisition came differently for my hoh kids than my hearing kids. They didn't absorb it like sponges. They needed more explanation, more interaction. 

  
It takes a lot of intention. But it does not have to be limiting. My two kids now: lawyer and medical laboratory scientist in their mid-20's.

Hi! I'm also the hearing parent of a HOH child. I recommend getting connected with the Deaf community, such as through a school for the deaf. Sign up for a Deaf mentor if you can. I have found it so valuable to learn from DHH adults since my child (16 months) cannot yet tell me about his experience. Connecting with other families of DHH kids can also be helpful, though to be honest, I've had some mixed experiences with other hearing parents having ableist views about our kids. But we do still attend playgroups and events for DHH kids because it's important to me that my kids see and get to know other DHH kids. I don't want my son to feel like he's the only one.

I also recommend learning ASL! Real time in person or virtual classes are ideal, but I know that can be challenging as the parent of young children. I have mostly been using the app Lingvano alongside the ASL at Home curriculum (https://www.aslathome.org/) and this book by Cecilia Grugan: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/714348/learn-to-sign-with-your-baby-by-cecilia-s-grugan-illustrated-by-brittany-castle/. ASL at Home is free to families with DHH kids. The latter two are both helpful for the kinds of vocabulary you need with young kids that might not come up as soon in ASL classes designed for adults. The site Lifeprint also has good resources, and the Oklahoma School for the Deaf offers free online classes every semester. We've also learned from our Deaf mentor. Learn ASL from Deaf people!

My son was diagnosed at 7 weeks and has had hearing aids for a little over a year now. I know it can feel like a lot to process at first, but truly, it's now just a normal part of our lives. You've got this!

Hi friend, I know things are stressful right now, and it feels like you're in uncharted waters. You've probably never met a Deaf person before. The good news is that this feels like unfamiliar ground but it's not. We've got the maps and now, we can help you find them too. Welcome to the Deaf/HoH community; we're happy you're here. 

Now, into the helpful stuff.

1ovvo6x,hardofhearing,how to cope with my mom?,,2025-11-13 08:18:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ovvo6x/how_to_cope_with_my_mom/
1ovta1y,hardofhearing,People look at me differently when I tell them I’m hard of hearing,"Hi all I’m 34, male. I take care of myself, I’m independent, I’ve built my life from scratch. But every damn time I try to talk to someone new a potential partner, someone I could genuinely connect with the moment I mention that I’m hard of hearing, everything changes.

It’s like a switch flips. The tone shifts, the replies get colder, and not long after… they vanish. I’m not angry about rejection that’s part of life but the reaction stings. It’s as if being hard of hearing suddenly makes me unworthy of basic respect or interest.

I’m not looking for pity or attention. I work, I live alone, I handle my life just fine. I just can’t hear as well as you do. That’s all. But people act like it’s some tragedy. The looks of pity, the “oh that’s sad” comments they drive me insane.

I’m honestly fed up. I’m not broken, I’m not less of a man. I just wish people saw the person first, not the hearing loss.

Anyone else who’s gone through something like this how do you keep your head straight when people keep treating you like you’re damaged goods?

Kinda trying to put a positive spin on this, in that they may be trying to make accommodations for you for when they talk to you?

For years ive said im hard of hearing which people dont really understand the implications, but now say partially deaf, which has better impact. Most people who know me, know to face me now, but that's taken years to ""teach"" them. Some dont bother and that's showing me the person they are, so I dont bother with them. Since partially deafness/hoh is more common, there is more awareness. 

However, there is one new meet, who will be chatting to others, I say hello and immediately she'll switch into exaggerated mouth movements and gestures. Almost talking to me like im stupid. But I take no offence. That's her ignorance and uneducated. I just smile and internally think im deaf, not stupid, go away and learn.

I’m sorry this happened to you. Those types of people aren’t worth your time. I gave up on dating because of my hearing loss, but have made many great friends who try to accommodate and are considerate of my hearing loss without making it a big deal or treating me as different. I hope you’re able to find people who don’t treat you like you’re damaged goods!

All. The. Time.

I just roll my eyes and ignore them and forget I ever crossed paths with them, honestly. I'm aware for some that's easier said than done, but a way to approach it is this: at the end of the day, does it matter in the grand scheme? Will you be thinking about this on your death bed many years from now?

There'll always be people like that, and there's not a lot we can do about that except control our own interactions with them. You could just walk away if it's bad enough.

As for the dating scene, if you're doing online dating, I find it helps tremendously to lay everything out on your profile. That's what I did and I eventually met my wife. I had nothing to hide or reveal on our first date, she knew up front what she was dealing with. That helps remove the anxiety on your part and, in a way, weeds out the potential mates you wouldn't want to be with anyway. Yeah, you might not get as many responses, but the few you do get? THOSE are the ones you want to be talking to. Especially the ones who contact you first!

Although I am also HoH, this rarely happens to me, people are actually willing to communicate. Also, your attitude towards life is positive enough so reactions people give to your disability hold no value. Sometimes we tend to lack confidence for this reason but then God chose us because we are strong enough to deal with it everyday. About the potential partner, not everyone is willing to communicate and stay for life given the challenges. I would say, look as much, go out and socialize through various activities, you'll definitely find the one.

Hello everyone I'm hearing of hard I'm not deaf .  
I just be alone everydays . It hurting too much I'm very hard to tell the communication.. that why  my friends is ignore me but I don't know yet what happened to me...
I'm hearing lost and my mind lost though 💔💔😭😭

I usually just mention it casually after we’ve been chatting for a while if it’s online. Usually before we plan to meet, and I just say it as a “btw you have speak clearly and directly at me because I have had bad hearing since I was young” type of thing vs hitting them with a medical condition right out the gate. If they are the right type of person they will want to know more as you get to know each other better.

I'm 35! I was in the same boat for a while.

Dating just reaaaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyy sucked as a gay dude. It's all so shallow now.  I ended up just putting everything front and center, and let people filter themselves out the door.

Dating feels so transactional and empty with the swiping - I had to mentally bolster myself, and just told myself that they are doing me a favor! You wouldn't want to be in a deep relationship with any of those people and then they suddenly reveal their shallow side and flake off on you when things are serious or you need them.

Someone who cares about you and is interested, will never be bothered at all, never be bothered by repeating what they say or learning new ways to communicate- And will be excited to be with you!

I just recently married after almost 5 years together!

There are good people out there, don't give up, but don't lower your standards for crappy people.

I went through the same thing. Lost my hearing in my early 30s and dating was a bit rough. I just stopped bringing it up or if people noticed, I just continued on as if everything was normal, because it was. 

If you're running into people that judge you at 34.... fuck em. I can't think of a single functioning adult that is worth their salt who would judge someone for a disability. Just do your thing man, there are plenty of women out there who don't give a shit and just want a nice, stable dude. It's hard enough dating in your 30s, the good ones are going to prioritize people who have their shit together over small physical things. 

I was able to land and marry a hottie as a mid/late 30s HA wearing male and I'm practically deaf, short, and pretty damn nerdy. If I could make it happen, I know for a fact that you can too! 

Biggest lesson I learned way back was that respect isn't earned, it's demanded. Meaning, if you act embarrassed of your hearing or bring it up in a way that opens the door to it, people will treat you like that. Just own it and be yourself. Confidence goes a lot further than you would think. Also, figure out where you can go on dates and hear well, wait a couple dates in for anywhere that might be a challenge.

Yes, this has been a common experience for me too. I put this info up front and center on my dating profile, I managed to phrase it in a positive way. ""It helps if you're interested in learning ASL or know some already as I'm \[deaf identity here\]."" 

The sad truth is many (most) people discriminate. The silver lining to this is being up front with the info saves me time, energy and emotional turmoil. There is no worrying about when to tell them like it's some dark secret. Anyone that connects has passed the initial discrimination filter, a promising sign.
  
I suggest focusing on making friends rather than going straight to a serious relationship. As a friend they get to know you. They see your heart and the (minor) flaws are no longer an instant disqualifier like they are when dating from the get-go. Relationships built on friendship is a great foundation as well.

Yup, I’m 35F and dealt with the same. As if it wasn’t hard enough dating with hearing loss to begin with!

I’m hard of hearing myself, granted only partially but I have a button that wear when I’m at work to tell ppl such. Some folks notice it and they speak up, or I tell them up front that I can’t hear them at first. I’ve even had some try to use sigh language which is kind of them, but I don’t even know much ASL!

I am sorry that you’ve faced such hurtles when it comes to your hearing, but I’d say it could help you figure out who is worth your time in some factors. Wishing you the best either way!

31f here and for me its kind of a joke. Like if you joke around about being deaf people are like, really? No way. And then they think its wild that im so functional even though the beep thresholds are in the 40s and 50s db 🤣😭

There seems to be a vibe that domes from saying you’re “hard of hearing” vs saying “I can’t hear very well” it’s weird but try and see if the people around you treat you differently?

I’m a 38 year old woman and I m literally in the exact same boat. I just feel like people don’t take us seriously or want to make the effort to communicate - even if we just have to ask for repetition. Yes learning ASL is great and that’s a whole community and culture but for us who are in the majority of the hearing world, it gets quite lonely.

OP, I'm very old and I've been very hard of hearing for a very, very long time and I've never, ever - not even once - experienced what you describe.

Are you telling this to people before you spend time with them?",2025-11-13 05:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ovta1y/people_look_at_me_differently_when_i_tell_them_im/

1ovgbq2,hardofhearing,Moderate Hearing Loss in One Ear - Seeking Advice for Next Steps,"Last week, after years of off-and-on tinnitus, a Meniere's diagnosis I never learned how to properly manage, and vestibular migraines, I found out I have permanent moderate hearing loss in my right ear.

My speech reception/awareness theshold is 25dB in my right ear, 10dB in my left. My word recognition was marked as 100% at 65dB for my right ear, and at 50dB for my left.

I was wondering if anyone out who has similar experience to this may have any recommendations. My ENT said a hearing aid evaluation is a reasonable next step, but she seemed to imply only some people similar to me find hearing aids preferable. 

My big question for that specifically is: Because my left ear is all good as of now, my main issue is struggling to hear people in loud environments, and differentiating someone/something I'm listening to from noise in general. Would a hearing aid help with this? Would it be worth some potential cons? And even the basics, like what even are the subjective cons for hearing aids? 

I haven't been able to find too much about those with a similar situation to mine, specifically when it comes to hearing aids, so any info would be very helpful.

Thank you so much!

with your WRS scores and very little hearing loss, id say nothing! having a hearing aid for a largely normal ear can do more harm than good. especially because your other ear is like a new born baby! hearing aids just make things louder and make hearing in loud environments harder. with menieres though i would absolutely stay on top of it since it can change!",2025-11-12 20:22:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ovgbq2/moderate_hearing_loss_in_one_ear_seeking_advice/
1ov3n0z,hardofhearing,Is it okay for me to wear a hard of hearing badge?,"Hello people! 
I already posted something similar in the r/disability but I figured I post here too because a, I didn't get many clear answers, b, I didn't know this subreddit existed before I posted in the other. 

So, I'm a fursuiter, and I was wondering if it's okay for me to wear a hard of hearing badge (people mentioned ""impaired hearing"" may be offensive to the hard of hearing community)
I have a - diagnosed - selective hearing disorder and a slightly damped hearing on my one ear. It's already hard for me to converse with people in calm environments sometimes because I just can't hear what they say and need to ask to repeat several times. I'm imagining on conventions and especially in fursuit this would be even worse. 
I don't understand sign language very well. I know some letters and some simple phrases but that's it. There's also no real courses to take to improve this in my area. 

Thank you for your input in advance!

The text here blends in a lot, if you want people to read it I’d suggest more contrast.

Use the tools you have to communicate your needs; it is appropriate for you to make accommodations for yourself. If you search this sub you’ll see that the community is largely in support of people with auditory processing disorder using the label hoh to communicate their access needs to people.

As a Hoh person, I really would like to wear this badge. Yeah, it is okay to wear :D

Most people won't notice or read it unless you point it out.

Of course it's okay, but just a little advice.

Make it large.

I used to wear a small one, but nobody ever noticed it.  Now I have one, large button, large font.  It's pretty up front.

One thing though is my badge tells people what to do.  ""I am hard of hearing.  Please speak clearly.""

I think the best thing about the buttons is that they encourage people to be more patient.

Also....

How do I get one of these lovely buttons with this design?

Makes sense to inform people about it. But the logo looks a bit like some ad, or decoration of some sort, which contradicts it's informative purpose, imo. I'd suggest a clean and neutral badge, with no decoration.

If you’re hard of hearing then yes, perfectly ok.

Absolutely. 
In fact, I think that’s great. It will, hopefully discourage people from being absolutely rude when in certain situations where they assume you have ignored them/and/or other miscommunication that tends to happen with those of us who are HH/deaf/Deaf.

I actually have a t-shirt that says this. I like to wear it when I food shopping,  etc.

Yes. I feel like I need to keep one and whip it out whenever coworkers get sassy with me ""ignoring"" or misunderstanding them.

Where do you buy badges like these, or get them made? Because I feel like this would improve the quality of my life, tremendously

Ive “de-googled” so it couldn’t let me in the form. 

But if these are some of the things you’re looking for: 

My alarm clock is a vibrating alarm clock since I can’t hear an audible one. Yay!

But there are so many other things I need now or will definitely need in the next 5-8 years to be similar: 
- smoke alarm or someone calling in an emergency when I’m asleep that will vibrate like that
- for that matter a vibrating alarm for the security system on my house. It’s gone off 2-3 times accidentally while I was sleeping and didnt wake me. 
- basically vibrating tech that can perform some of the tasks of a hearing service dog.

I'd say real time captioning glasses is something I wish was a reality in the next few years. I could see Meta glasses having this capability but I don't think they will

I've had about 4 different models of shake-awake alarm clocks that store in pillows - all lasted a year or two, because the quality was crap.

1osmjp8,hardofhearing,Congenital deafness due to Kallmann syndrome,"I have a medical condition called Kallmann syndrome that affects puberty and fertility.

I also have two additional symptoms that are associated with having Kallmann syndrome, congenital anosmia and congenital hearing loss. 

My lack of sense of smell and poor hearing were both noticed in childhood but it took until I was 23 to be correctly diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome. The fact I had poor hearing and no sense of smell as well as not starting puberty should have led to an earlier diagnosis but that is another story. I was incorrectly labelled as a ""late bloomer"" for a long time as a teenager. 

I was once told I had 70% hearing loss in my left ear and 10% in my right ear. Senso-neural hearing loss. I believe the testing is different now. I used to have testing done through the NHS but they basically said it is not getting worse or better so they was not much point in having appointments any more. 

At school I was given a NHS (I live in the UK) hearing aid for my ""bad"" ear using a in ear mould. It worked up to a point but I did not like wearing it much and I ended up losing more than one of them.

As I got older I stopped using an aid for a while but found I had to restart about 10 years ago. The modern aids seem to suit me better and I got told that there was no point having an aid in my ""bad"" ear as no amount of volume would help, so instead I have a modern blue tooth chargeable aid (from Costco) for my good ear which suits me far better. 

I like the fact I can play podcasts from my I Phone through the hearing aid but I still wear headphones since I am so used to them and I do not have to worry about any noise leakage from the hearing aid.

[Per this copy of their non-discrimination policy available to the public in Google Search,](https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/Dignity%20Nondiscrimination%20Policy.pdf) you can contact their compliance office to indicate that they need to provide accommodations for you. They can determine what accommodations are reasonable/suitable and then instruct the office accordingly.

* 800-367-8939 (TTY)

Frankly this is absolutely appalling.

It's a one party state, you can record whatever you want if you're in the conversation. Your doctor's an idiot. This probably violates the ADA and you may want to insist on CART if you can't record (and you can) so you know wtf the doctor is saying. Auxiliary aids are exempt from HIPAA and it's your records being disclosed to you so it wouldn't apply anyway.

I'd e-mail a Hard of Hearing or Deaf or Disability group in the area to find out more.

Livetranscribe doesn't keep a record like the other person said but you're perfectly able to do so.

Not a lawyer not legal advice.

Android Live Transcribe has an option to transcribe without saving records

Is it something that they can arrange on their end?  They should be fine with a transcriber that they control, I would believe.

Ask for CART

That’s a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.

If it were me, I would tell them that you are a person with a disability and require accommodation to have equal access to care. Point out that they are violating the ADA and that they should be more concerned about that than you recording the conversation unless the care team is actively planning in advance to commit medical malpractice. Note that you are consenting to the recording so there’s no risk of you asserting a HIPPA claim. Request that they provide a suitable alternative or consent to you using your transcriber.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? Talk about? I feel like the tube shouldn’t be in there anymore but now I’m betting it’ll be a bigger issue. Is this just what I have to live with? I wonder if there’s scar tissue or something affecting the whole canal. I’m just lost on what to do, has anyone else experienced this?

I’m sure there’s some implications that would say it would make my hearing loss worse, but seeing as I’m already HOH, it’s not a big deal to me. It’s the constant internal sounds, and the fact that I can’t use my hearing aid when I’m having issues, which causes more stress on me.

Just want to say I totally relate. I don’t really have an answer other than get a second opinion if you can since this current path doesn’t seem to really be working for you. 

I was in your position many moons ago, and because of the constant drainage and/or ear infections my ENT convinced me bone-anchored hearing aids were the better option. And they are if you can’t keep your ears dry. 

So I had the first implant surgery. And apparently my insurance stiffed the surgery center. So they refused to schedule the second one. And that’s how I have one BAHA implant. 

Years later I found a different surgeon who performed a tympanoplasty on one ear, and that’s been great. Got me to the point I could wear regular hearing aids. But the other ear has a microscopic hole that still drains and sometimes bursts so it’s still a chancer. 

*All that to say* you’re right. Permanent tubes and regular hearing aids don’t play well with each other, generally. You need a plan for dry ears or for a different type of hearing aid. If you’re current provider isn’t listening to your needs, get another opinion — assuming that’s an option. 

I hope you find a good solution soon.

I have one PE tube. It was inserted this year after many, many ear infections in my right ear. I am HoH but only really the right ear. 

The persistent infections perforated my ear drum more than once and I go so many infections. I don’t know why. I could constantly hear fluid in there and felt pressure a lot. The tube has really helped all that and I worry about it coming out and going back to life without it. 

Yours could be helping more than you think? Sorry you’re having a tough time. The unknown aspects of hearing loss are hard. A lot of what ifs.

Edit. I have worn my hearing aid only once since having the tube put it.",2025-11-06 15:45:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oq2cni/pe_tubes/
1oowqp0,hardofhearing,Music with headphones.,"1 month ago i decided to buy some headphones off of ross for 30 bucks, they seemed great! i listened and listened about 75 decibels~ but then a week ago (more on my left ear) i had this popping yet aching pain in both of my ears lately i havent had them checked out yet so is this a sign of tinnitus? ear infection? you name it.

It could be an ear infection,  I've got plenty of them before getting my hearing checked.  It's best to go to the doctor and get antibiotics.  Hope you feel better soon.

75 dB is enough to damage your hearing. ""Sounds at 75 dB are generally considered safe for short periods, but prolonged exposure to noise at this level can potentially lead to hearing loss over time. It's best to limit exposure to sounds above 70 dB to protect your hearing.""",2025-11-05 07:39:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oowqp0/music_with_headphones/

A long time ago, back around 2002–2007, we went to the same Queensdale elementary school. He’s deaf / hard of hearing and so am I too. I remember his birthday being in May. After 2007, he moved away — I was told it might’ve been to Cuba, but I never knew for sure. Now it's 2025, he would be 26 right now.

It’s been so many years now. I’ve searched in every way I can think of. I guess this post is half a vent, half a small hope that someone here might remember him.

I just want to know he’s okay, somewhere out there.

Thanks for letting me put this out there.

I am currently working in retail. Some days are okay, but it’s been a struggle lately. I fear that my hearing has changed again. I am currently using a single hearing aid. I’ve not been able to get a second device yet. 

Lately, it’s been a struggle with hearing customers and particularly answering phones. It’s becoming distressing to me because I feel my performance at work has greatly diminished. Not really sure what my alternatives are and trying to make the best of it. Would really appreciate any suggestions or advice for help. Thank you!

I also work retail, and it's such a pain. I'm lucky enough to have loud colleagues and stable hearing, but still, it's insane the number of customers who mumble their orders; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble it slightly differently; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble in another different way; I ask them to speak up, and say it again; and then they yell at you; I usually pull out one of my hearing aids, show it to them, then say I'm hard of hearing, and ask if they could just repeat their order loudly and clearly; they usually do, and look kinda ashamed about yelling at me (which is the least consolation I would ask for). 

If you can get a few colleagues on side, to speak up for you (literally, not as in talk to management, although telling customers that they need to speak up is nice), you'll find it gets much easier. If you are able to take tasks from colleagues and give them the phone, that also tends to go pretty well if you plan how to do that ahead of time. 

But generally, retail is already crappy, but apparently it's more crappy if you can't hear what's going on. Finding the spare time to enjoy it is great though.",2025-11-04 22:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ool929/struggling_with_hearing_loss_working_in_retail/

1omxyxc,hardofhearing,Safety questions,"Hey everyone who are here, I have two safety questions. Easy and hard

I don’t hear the smoke detector so which brand do you use and why, like powerful strobe light. 

If my wife has a fall how would I know. The iPhone app would notify me after emergency notification. Any other ways to do this? And, she’s diabetic and would send an alert to my phone which I probably wouldn’t hear. Other than in the canal aids, any ideas? I take out mine at night.  TIA

[댓글]
If your concerns is specifically when you're asleep, I'd recommend getting a bed shaker. I got mine to alert me when the baby is crying, but you can set them up to go off with fire alarms, phone alerts, etc. Here's the brand I use: https://www.sereneinnovations.com/collections/home-alert

I have an IPhone and Apple Watch. Notifications can buzz on my wrist. It’s enough of a buzz to wake me up. Maybe look for an app that can connect to an Apple Watch. Apple Watch also has a fall detection feature. I don’t know how it connects to others, but I imagine it has some kind of alert system. 

Alternatively, look for an app that has different options for notification sounds. Something at a good frequency for you.

She can get a smart watch with fall detection. It will send an alert to your phone. If you have smart house things (like Google home and hue lights) you could program your phone to send those alerts to the lights so they blink. I don't know how to do that, but I know it's possible.

Ask your local fire department about smoke alarms. Many install ones appropriate for hearing loss.

You may want to look into getting an alert system for the deaf or hard of hearing. These systems monitor for common sounds (doorbell, kitchen appliances, fire/smoke alarm, baby cry, pet sounds) and send a notification of the sound to a receiver that alerts the deaf or hard of hearing person of the sound. Many of these alert systems also can be triggered by the push of a button transmitter. If your wife were to push the button, the alert system would notify you via whatever receiver mechanism you’ve selected (light, sound, vibration, or all three). 

[Diglo](https://www.diglo.com) (formerly Harris Communications) is a good source for alert technologies for deaf and hard of hearing consumers. 

[Sonic Alert](https://www.sonicalert.com/home-aware-signaling?page=1) has a [HomeAware system](https://www.diglo.com/sonic-alert-homeaware-ii-signaling-hub;sku=SA-HA360M-II;s=322;p=SA-HA360M-II) that listens for smoke/CO detector alerts/sirens and alerts the homeowner with flashing lights, sound, and/or vibration. 

[Silent Call](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/transmitter) also has [transmitters](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/fire-alarm-transmitter-contact-input) and [receivers](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/medallion-series-shake-up-receiver-with-vibrator-su5001mc) that can be tied into smoke/CO detectors (as well as phones, weather alerts, doorbells). 

There’s also a [Safe Awake](https://www.hearmore.com/product/safeawake-smoke-alarm-aid-with-bed-shaker?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21019171632&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADD0mp6_Y3kUzBvreN2C6OA7F6PdA&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8fbEk7jMkAMVbjRECB3-KiOMEAQYBSABEgJ71_D_BwE) monitor for smoke/CO detectors.

After researching my options for a few weeks, I just made the decision to get a [bundled alerting system](https://us.bellman.com/collections/alerting-devices) from [Bellman &amp; Symfon](https://us.bellman.com). Although the price point was higher than I would have preferred, I liked that the system is modular, easy-to-use, and has a wide range of plug and play transmitters, receivers, and accessories to choose from. This is my first alert system, and so finding something safe, simple, and scalable was important to me. 

I hope you’ll find something that meets your needs.

[EDIT: In my research I also found the following two First Alert alarm options that have strobe lights: [smoke](https://a.co/d/8nMdhBe) and [smoke/CO](https://a.co/d/28eD6yN). I think both of these would be good options for D/HH homes.]

[Another Edit: I also really like [SquareGlow](https://www.squareglow.com/). They are [deaf-owned](https://www.squareglow.com/pages/about-us) and more budget friendly than most, and their products have a modern look and feel. They have a reasonably priced [SOS button](https://www.squareglow.com/collections/accessories/products/squareglow-sos-button) ([SquareGlow on Diglo](https://www.diglo.com/shop-by-alerting-system/squareglow;d=3;c=33;s=341)).

1ombvgx,hardofhearing,partial deaf and ear wax are nightmare for me,"Call this my bad luck or anything, but being a cerumen and partially deaf is a nightmare for me. The earwax makes it more tough to listen to other people. Also, i have been using earphones a lot lately, which i might think are also a reason for the increase in earwax buildup. I have had this earwax tool and it has performed great till now, however i wonder if someone else is facing a situation like me.

I remove my earwax daily and it has now become an after shower routine for me, as throughout the day the earwax eventually builds up and clogs up the ear.

[댓글]
Earwax problems are  a  common for me too cause when I put on my hearing aids my body makes extra earwax to push out the „foreign  body“. So I think a similar things is prolly happening with your earphones. You might want to wear headphones instead just to be safe

I’m in the same boat and have my ears professionally cleaned about once a year. I wear OTEs and AirPods and it’s just the best thing to do - anyone who wears something in the canal daily and produces a lot of wet wax naturally would generally benefit from getting it looked at occasionally and discussing what cadence of cleaning makes sense.

What hearing we have is so precious that I simply don’t risk doing the removal myself.

Would be worth having a specialist look at it and see if anything could be done medically",2025-11-02 08:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ombvgx/partial_deaf_and_ear_wax_are_nightmare_for_me/
1om5w00,hardofhearing,Looking for an app or device that helps with text to speech?,"Hi I’m currently a student. Lectures are hard with my hearing loss. What are your favorite apps that help with transcribing what the person in front of you is saying into text? Im also looking for a device that does something similar. Thanks! 

[댓글]
I’m a big fan of live transcribe for everyday use, although there does seem to be some difference in accuracy between the free and paid for versions. I’ve never really had a problem with it personally and have found paying for the app worth it. 

I also occasionally use the otter app if I know there’s going to be many different speakers. It also summarises the conversation and allows you to save them to look back on.

I use an iPhone so can’t tell you whether these apps work for android use. Hope you find something that works for you.

Android LiveTranscribe is free and pretty accurate. I have the app on my phone but I also have several cheap Samsung tablets that I use exclusively for LiveTranscribe and several of my friends keep a tablet at their houses with LiveTranscribe in case I come over. It’s nice having a dedicated device so I can use my phone for phone things while having a conversation. It doesn’t differentiate between speakers, but you can have it save your conversations for a period of days.

Lots of decent Speech to Text stuff.

Most people like LiveTranscribe on Android. I mostly used that until I wrote my own app.

If you're in the US you have the right to accommodations per the ADA(for now with the way trump is gutting everything). This means you can use/ get/ demand CART which is like closed captions in class. (Yes, even if you have an ASL interpreter) 

If you're talking about just everyday personal interactions, I use live transcribe but it's always a hit or miss. It often misunderstands to the point of where I'll just put it away bc it's nonsense. 

If you have enough hearing for it to be worthwhile, you can invest in a Roger pen; which is a microphone that connects to your hearing aids for people to talk into.

Both Apple and Android have Live Transcribe or Live Captions built in.

Otter.ai is my preferred app for live transcription, it saves the transcript, although you have to pay.

Innocaption is a free call transcribing app that also offers human transcribers, through the FCC.

Grain.com is my actual favorite app for transcription that I use on my video calls, however it's not live. I use the Zoom or Google or Teams captions during the call and then get the Grain transcript afterwards. Best quality I've found.

But you were looking for a text-to-speech app. How would that help? Shouldn’t you want a speech-to-text app?

for real time lecture transcription, google live transcribe is probably the easiest option if you’re using android since it instantly captions what’s being said. if you want to record lectures and later convert them to text, uniconverter does a good job handling that offline so you don’t have to depend on wifi or cloud services. it’s pretty useful for reviewing notes privately afterward.",2025-11-02 02:20:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om5w00/looking_for_an_app_or_device_that_helps_with_text/
1om4j0o,hardofhearing,I’m new here! Any advice? How are the people here?,"I just got diagnosed with Mild Hearing Loss a couple days ago after teachers and my parents started to realized that I was struggling with my hearing.

It’s only mild of course, so it shouldn’t be a big deal, but I’m kinda worried.

I can barely hear my friends in large crowds, and microphones sometimes don’t help as they echo, making the words sound gibberish or muffled to me.

I can’t understand men well since their voices are deeper, which means I have trouble talking to my dad, brother, and friends that are boys, and it kinda makes me sad.

I think it’s affecting my school life too because I tend to not understand what my teachers are saying, but I’m too scared to ask for them to repeat themselves because I don’t want to be accused of not listening.

Right now I’m teaching myself ASL. I used to do it when I was younger before I grew out of it, so I need to reconnect with it.

But anything else? It kinda hurts to not hear everything, and a bit scary too.

Edit: I’m also teaching myself to lip-read, and it’s actually a bit easier than expected, but I still struggling with it.

[댓글]
We’re all frustrated and exhausted and have commiseration as a group. Get proper hearing aids. ASL is good to learn but you need someone to communicate with and that’s a big expectation.

Welcome to the group. Who diagnosed your hearing loss? Did you have a comprehensive hearing test with an audiologist? Did they review your audiogram and explain what it meant in a way you could understand it? Besides diagnosing you with mild loss what did they recommend? If you’re not understanding in multiple situations they should have recommended some type of assistive devices such as hearing aids. If not, why didn’t they? 
Lots of questions that you deserve to have answered. Many of our first lessons in having hearing loss was the importance of advocating for ourselves. We need and deserve complete information. If you’re in the US check out the Hearing Loss Association of America at hearing loss.org. I’ve learned so much from them and you do t have to be a member to access their resources. You can handle this with help from those who know. Good luck!

Thanks for explaining further. I’m not an audiologist so I hesitate to contradict what you were told after three tests, but I decided to google “no hearing aids for mild hearing loss.” I did so based on your clear description of when you have trouble understanding words. You’re better than most people at identifying and describing your challenges. I do know loss of high frequencies is the most common symptom. It especially impacts how well we understand in noisy environments. Most Google results say people can be helped. Here’s what the Cleveland Clinic (a trusted source) says”:
 Even people with a mild degree of hearing loss may find that they are having trouble hearing what they should. Today’s digital hearing aids give audiologists the capability of programming the aids to fit a wide range of hearing losses. You don’t need to have a lot of hearing loss to find that a hearing loss can cause you a lot of frustration. Persons with a mild hearing loss may find that they have difficulty hearing quiet speech, or hearing someone speaking from a distance. If a hearing loss is negatively affecting your life it’s time to schedule an appointment with an audiologist to find out what amplification options could benefit you. “Hearing aids are for people with a great deal of hearing loss. I just have a mild hearing loss, I don’t need hearing aids.” There are many options available to help people with any degree of hearing loss – from mild to profound. An audiologist can review these options to see which would be the best fit for you!”
 I identify with your frustration but I don’t want to cause you trouble with your provider, so please proceed as you feel comfortable. Sometimes second opinion can be a good idea.",2025-11-02 01:12:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om4j0o/im_new_here_any_advice_how_are_the_people_here/
1om2xz0,hardofhearing,Has anyone experienced this?,"Went for a hearing test yesterday and the results were 3 losses between 1-8hz at 30db and the rest were at 20db in one ear, the other has a drop at 4hz at 40db and the rest were at 15/20db.

For the worse ear, she said a HA wouldn’t help even though I fall short in 3 areas despite working with primary children and having tinnitus. Real world experience was quickly dismissed.

She said if I’d been 70+ she would have given me tablets for the tinnitus (didn’t know that was an option…) and HA’s won’t do anything for the tinnitus.

She asked about the tinnitus and I said it was predominantly in one ear but I could hear it in both. Was I sure it was only one ear because if it was I need an mri but if it’s both I don’t. I’ve had the tinnitus for 10+ years. 

She then asked ‘so what are you going to do?’ and I said get a new job as I can’t hear the children with the background noise so I’m effectively unable to do my job. 

The next statement from her ‘I’ll write a letter and see if you can have one as you’re borderline’ despite being at 3 30db losses. Who exactly is she writing to? 

As I was leaving she ended on saying ‘I’ll put you forward for a HA, if it doesn’t work at least we’ve tried’.

I’m in the north of England and have waited 18 months for the NHS appointment and when I got there I felt I had to beg for help and she was spouting BS, am I the only one or was she right in what she said?

Reading this over I feel it’s more of a vent but I’m curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar? 



[댓글]
I was told by my audiologist that he wouldn’t push me for hearing aids as that was my decision to make. With that being said I’m not sure exactly who she’s writing to. Maybe because your hearing loss isn’t severe enough she’s worried that the manufacturer/ hospital won’t want to float the cost. 









Additionally while I understand that hearing aids aren’t necessarily a treatment for tinnitus I don’t understand why she wouldn’t give you treatment for it. Ask for a second option from someone else and get an appointment with an ent if you haven’t.

Definitely get a second opinion. The NHS is a fantastic resource but it's so overstretched and underfunded, it's a struggle to get the help you're supposed to be entitled to. When you find the right person it's amazing and they can change your life, but it's a fight to find the right professional and then say the right thing to them. I was born deaf but I was 26 by the time I got an appointment with a professor in ENT, I said ""no matter how loud the hearing aids are, nothing ever gets any clearer"" - and because of him, I got my BAHA processor on my 27th birthday :) Before him, they just kept turning my hearing aids up and up and up...

Stand your ground the best you can. Write down everything she said while you can remember it and at the next appointment, ask them to explain everything in detail. Bring a handy hearing person to sit in with you if you've got one. I'm in my thirties but still ask my mum to come with me to these type of appointments because she's great at asking WHO are you writing to, when I'm still processing that she'll write to someone.",2025-11-01 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om2xz0/has_anyone_experienced_this/

Does anyone have any ideas for how she could help me during a panic attack when I can't lip-read her to follow directions etc? 

[댓글]
This is in person? Instead of just talking through she could model techniques that do not rely heavily on verbal instructions. For example, the butterfly tap can be demonstrated. And also, you need to have a conversation about this and come to an agreement as to what helps in these situations. She is the therapist but you are the expert of your experience.

Literally text on paper and body language. And very important: talk about it and agree on what the steps are and somewhat rehearse what to do while you're okay. Trying to teach someone how to get theough it while they're in the deep end is hard regardless of ability to communicate.

I’m so sorry you’re suffering with panic attacks. You might want to try Live Transcribe or another transcription app. There also are therapists who specialize in working with deaf and hard of hearing patients. (((HUGS)))

My family has a lot of HoH people but no one knows sign. What has worked in these situations is having a plan ahead of time and hand signals. Like we have one for ""sensory overload, I need to go outside,"" and one for ""I need space right now, can't talk."" Maybe different techniques could have signals, or you could use visual cards.

1ol2v7m,hardofhearing,Pros and cons of rechargeable hearing aids?,"Looking to get new hearing aids in the next year, but I've been told by my audiologist that my only options are rechargeable ones. I regularly listen to music through bluetooth at work, so I'm worried about how long the hearing aids would last before needing to be charged again. My current pair are from Oticon, so I'd appreciate any reviews that are specific to them. Thanks!

[댓글]
I have rechargeable oticons, and I’m so happy I made the switch. Mine are connected to my phone by Bluetooth 24/7, and the charge typically lasts about 20 hours. It’s been an absolute godsend to not have to think about carrying batteries everywhere.

i had battery driven ones, and now i have rechargeable ones. I must say battery is 100 times better. You can buy batteries from amazon like 400 for 20€ or something. 

I just hate the fact that you have to spend extra 200€ on a box that can charge your batteries and dry them. And if you forget to charge them ( what happens to me sometimes) the day will be hard. If you forget battery you can jsut go to a shop nearby and buy  them there. 

If i had to choose again i would buy batterie driven hearing aids. 

Also they are often 100€-200€ cheaper.

I have Phonak hearing aids. I regularly use the Bluetooth option. It lasts me from 7am to 10pm so pretty much all day, even when using the Bluetooth. I can't think of any inconveniences for me at the moment, has them for 4 years.

I listen to music pretty much continuously from waking up until bedtime on my HAs and have maybe once had the battery run out (and that in my right ear which has the volume higher thanks to that ear being worse). I wouldn’t get anything else.

I resisted for a long time for god knows why and I wish I’d made the switch sooner.

Your audiologist is either misinformed or lying.  There are battery options for many hearing aid brands/models--even the Oticon website shows battery options.  Our son (19) insists on battery hearing aids and just received a new pair in September.  He sticks with Resound the majority of the time (he has the Nexia model right now).  He had rechargeable Phonaks a while back and returned them within the return window.  He didn't like the sound quality, and he streams a ton, so he was having to use his old ones as backup while the Phonaks were charging.  He also likes to wear at least one to bed (yeah, I know...), so he has at least one in 24/7.

  
We had a three day power outage a while back, and he was quite thankful for the battery hearing aids.  He wouldn't have been able to charge them.  Also, rechargeables degrade in battery life over time.  Probably an unpopular opinion, but it's definitely what works better for the way our son uses them.

Rechargeable batteries have a finite life.

Modern rechargeable batteries can last all day. I have signia HAs and they never want to sit in the charger right, so I have woken up to a dead battery several times. Some HAs use induction charging to solve that problem. 

I have the same signia HAs with disposable batteries. Overall, I like the disposable batteries more. One downside, in the US, is the new packaging.

Well now you have me wondering if listening via Bluetooth has more impact on the battery than just regular daily listening (not Bluetooth). I would think it wouldn't make much difference, but I don't actually know. 



FWIW, I have Phonak, Audeo P90. I charge them overnight and the battery lasts from 6 am until about 10 pm, with probably not more than an hour or so of streaming a podcast or book. Music sounds a little weird through the HAs and I can't figure out what setting to change, and it's not worth it to me to spend the money for an audiologist appointment so she can click this or that setting so that my music sounds right. So I just use AirPods or a speaker to listen to music. I can fit the AirPods in with the HAs still in, and it's not a great fit but good enough. I can hear well enough that if the fit is bothering me I just take out the HAs and use the AirPods alone.  



Despite the hassle of needing to charge them (and needing to recharge them partway through the day if I'm going to be staying up late), I still like them better than batteries. I was always having my battery die when I was out, and I never carried batteries around with me every day but I hated to waste part of the battery by changing them too early. Once I was on my way to the movies when I heard the telltale signal and I had to pull over and make an emergency run to the drugstore for new ones. Plus the guilt of throwing all those batteries in the landfill or trying to find a place that accepts batteries for recycling (now basically impossible)...it was a bummer. So I'm Team Rechargeable.

I had no choice with my Phonaks, they only come with rechargeables.  However they easily last all day with a fair amount of bluetooth use and luckily I haven't forgotten the charger on overnight trips.

Most people i know who has them and who have also had HA's with batteries say theyre a downgrade.

Im from the Netherlands where we get insurance cover for 75% every 5 years for new HAs. The last time i purposefully went with battery charged HAs because of all the negative reviews.

I did notice a lot of technical improvements from the 5 year ones before that (2017 vs 2022) though I must say, these ones are becoming shittier and shittier and I kind of really need new ones now but i gotta wait so long.

Im really hoping by the time im eligble for new ones the rechargable situation has improved a lot atleast.

Im sticking by rechargeable! I have the Phonak Audeo rechargeable and the battery lasts close to 24 hours if I don't stream anything. I LOVE the fact that they're Bluetooth and I can take calls and listen to music on em when needed. The reason why I got phonak is that they have an extra battery pack you can add to the charging case for traveling and its been a blessing!

I'm about to start working in the medical field, so this was a must have. Rechargeable for life! No more lost batteries, or dead battery packages. 

Only downside is if the battery does, you have to send the whole aid in to get fixed. I hate doing that since I NEED both to function. Luckily, I've always had temporary devices available, but I would rather there was a better way around it.

My considerations — I like the rechargeable but these are the pros and cons:

* You will lose your charger. You either need two or you need a plan for what to do while you wait for the new one to arrive. It's not like a phone charger.
* You can buy batteries in any drugstore.
* Batteries can give out at any point during the day, leaving you fumbling to replace them during a meeting or dinner. Rechargeables if you store them at night will last through the day.
* If you're listening to music a lot, you will run through a lot of batteries.
* The new battery packaging is hot garbage and may be a ploy by Big Battery to get you to go rechargeable.
* Before your 3 year warranty is up on the rechargeables, you can send your HAs in for a warranty replacement and they will give you new ones. They do not do that for the battery version.

I’m on my third set of OTICON HA’s and my current set is rechargeable and THEY ARE THE BEST!  The charge lasts up to 15 hours and that’s with me using the tv sound converter box via Bluetooth and/or listening to music. ♥️👍🏼🤩

I am awful at remembering my HA when I get home since I only use them in public. My batteries last like 4-5 days and I don’t think they cost too much

I made the switch to rechargable oticon hearing aids last September (2024). I will never go back to battery powered hearing aids.  They've changed my life.  I'm a mom of 3, ADHD and it's one less thing for me to remember. It's awful to be out with the kids and have to stop and buy hearing aid batteries bc the diaper bag didn't have the new package.  Also, I've only had them die once but it's because I woke up at 4am, put them on, used them all day till almost 11pm... Insane battery life with the charge.  And they connect right to my phone. It's so nice!

I've only tried rechargeable ones but they last 16h for me so I don't have issues with them running out and I always remember to charge them with my phone and my smart watch every night. However I do get worried I'll lose the charging box thing as they are ridiculously overpriced plus then I'll be stuck until I can get a new charger.

My HAs use 312 batteries and is &gt;3 years old now. When I replace them it’ll probably be rechargeable. 

How many charging cycles do the batteries last and are they replaced? If yes, what is the cost?

I have rechargeable phonaks- they bluetooth stream well and they last all day even if I'm streaming.

I listen to audiobooks. My last from when I get up in the morning to when I go to bed at night.

I'm in the process of getting new hearing aids too. I've had my set of rechargeable hearing aids for going on 6 years, previously had a few iterations of replaceable battery hearing aids (essentially from the age of 5 to 14, so 9 years). 

I'll say, that the rechargeable hearing aids are great, the battery life throughout the day (even after 6 years, and only minor repairs to some parts) is amazing, I can usually get 20-ish hours of use on a low Bluetooth day, and 16\~18-ish hours on a day with a lot of music and videos. 

The only issue I seem to come across with them is that \*when\* you do forget to plug them in over-night, you're out of hearing aids for a day, unless you can charge them on-the-way-to or at work, or whatever thing you need to do that day. However, if your current hearing aids are still serviceable, it may be beneficial if you are able to keep them to work for the hour-to-three-hours that it takes to charge the hypothetical new ones; that way, you make up for the down time that charging takes up.",2025-10-31 18:47:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ol2v7m/pros_and_cons_of_rechargeable_hearing_aids/
1okscwg,hardofhearing,Plugged Feeling but Everything Normal?,"Hey all!

Had moderate to severe hearing loss in my left and deaf in my right ear my whole life.

A few weeks ago after my Rituximaub infusion for MS, I noticed something felt off.

Felt plugged up or sounds muted a bit. Went to a CVS MinuteClinic and no signs of ear infection. Went to an ENT and had a bit of wax removed and a hearing test.

Test showed a 5 drop in the 250 range and like 15 in 10k and above.

My ear was puffy from wax removal and both the ENT and my normal audiologist didn't see anything concerning as the changes fell within normal range of error.

If I clear my eustachian tubes everything sounds better. Been taking a generic antihistamine to try and help.

Finally, my hearing aid is an Oticon OPN so not sure if that thing is EOL since its old.

Long story short to say I have no idea if this is weirdly psychological since according to the experts nothing is wrong?  

[댓글]
It could be psychological or it could residual puffiness from the cleaning or slight inflammation or irritation from something like allergies

That plugged feeling can totally happen even when tests look normal. It could be mild Eustachian tube stuffiness or just your brain adjusting post-wax removal. Give it time, stay on the antihistamine, and maybe get your OPN checked older aids can sometimes distort sound a bit.",2025-10-31 11:47:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1okscwg/plugged_feeling_but_everything_normal/
1oks8st,hardofhearing,Are children loud(er than average) because of HoH parent?,"I had mild-moderate hearing loss when my first child was born 6 years ago and I got my first hearing aids around the same time. In the meantime I progressed to moderate-severe loss, which was only detected a year ago. I'm just now testing new aids and adjustment is difficult, my world suddenly got really really noisy again. Especially my kids (4 and 6).  
I knew that they are ""of the louder variety"" already. They like loud play (stomping, running, shouting, arguing...) but also their normal talking voice seems louder than average.   
Their father keeps complaining how loud they are (his hearing is very good). And we had neighbours complaining that our kids are too loud (we live in an appartment building).   
And I myself feel that I cannot really assess their noise level. With the new hearing aids they aften seem sooo loud (but the rustling of my jacket is also really loud...), without it's no problem (obviously).  
  
Now It suddenly occured to me: what if it's me being HoH causing my kids to be so loud? That they feel the need to be loud to be heard, literally.  
What are the experiences of other HoH parents?

edit: vocabulary

[댓글]
I think in general when they’re younger no. Little kids are loud because they haven’t learned to control their volume yet. However older kids say around the age of 10 might be louder if their parents are hard of hearing. That’s because they have learned that they need to be louder than normal for their parent to hear them.

I'm HoH (severe-profound), lost my hearing around age 2, but it wasn't diagnosed until I was 4. the teachers and doctors were actually concerned my brother had hearing loss because he was so loud, so he got tested before I did, but it was just that he was speaking loudly for me. all my siblings are louder than normal, and I have a loud family in general, in part because I'm HoH. I never noticed it growing up (obviously, to me it was a good volume), but my wife was the one who pointed out to me that I have a loud family lol. I don't know if that's common, with children being louder because of HoH family members, but it happened here!

I'm loud, but I'm also hoh/deaf 

I grew up with family who were hoh given we had to SPEAK up 

My whole family is loud 
We don't yell we project, lol 😆

Totally possible kids naturally adapt to how we respond. If they learned Mom hears better when they’re louder, they’ll keep doing it. Also, with new aids, *everything* sounds extra intense at first. Give it time your brain will adjust, and they’ll learn volume control too.

I think it’s common for Hard of Hearing people to be annoyed by noise, since hearing aids don’t cope with noise well. It’s difficult to communicate if it’s noisy. I probably hush people, require good lighting and eye contact. Loud volume is not something I appreciate, the hearing aids can amplify, from people I expect clear speech.

I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and HoH in my left. So, my kids grew up with the fact that I couldn't hear well and also couldn't afford a hearing aid. 

My youngest daughter is 32 and a couple of months ago, at work, was told by a coworker that she ""laughs too loud and talks too loud"" sometimes. She said: ""Oh, sorry. My mom is deaf and sometimes I forget that I don't have to be loud."" The person scoffed with a ""yeah, right"" before walking away. I asked her: ""Do you want me to come to your office and stand next to her desk and not respond to her when she demands to know who I am and what I'm doing there? Because I WILL!""

My son (34) was once told by a woman he was seeing that he ""laughed too loud"". I told him that wasn't a ""deaf mom"" thing so much as it was ""we're a family of cackle-laughing seagulls"" thing.

I have a four year old grandgoblin and sometimes, my daughter (the 36 year old) will ask me how I was able to tolerate three noisy kids. I just smiled and took out my hearing aids: ""I didn't have these!""

Yep. Household of five here, 3 are hoh. The baby of the family has normal hearing, but boy is she LOUD. Ha!

I’m the kind of hoh person that just wants the important info. My kids (2&amp;4) are surprisingly not loud but I do think they’ll probably come across as rude as they get older because it’s acceptable in our house to just say “nevermind” when I don’t hear or speak with a loud angry tone if it’s important. E.g. if the situation isn’t easy for hearing I usually just answer with “I can’t hear you” or “is it important?”. I often can’t be bothered making the effort to hear. 

Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re fairly quiet when they’re older. In a 2 storey house my husband and I often just text each other instead of yelling. I assume the kids will be the same when they get phones. Hoping to learn a bit of my country’s sign language when the kids are a bit older.",2025-10-31 11:41:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oks8st/are_children_louder_than_average_because_of_hoh/
1okjxo3,hardofhearing,Battery life shorter?,"Anyone else notice battery life getting shorter? 

My 612s used to last a week, then the time got down to 5 days, now the time is 3 days. Nothing in my daily routine has changed.

[댓글]
Check if there is a bluetooth option, &amp; if so disable it - bluetooth is radio, which sucks battery life. I also discovered with my new aids that had a different battery compartment, that closing the hearing aid overnight storage container lids would compress on the hearing aid battery compartment, turning the aid on, reducing battery life!

Are your batteries the same make over the years? 
Also, if your batteries are of the zinc-air type then they should come with a sticker on one side. This is to cover the air access hole. Air activates this kind of battery, which then slowly discharges, lessening its life. Ensure to leave the sticker on until you are ready to actually replace a flat battery.

Seems the only other things that have changed are the make of batteries, &amp; the models of hearing aids. Can you pinpoint a time that reduced battery life coincides with either of those changes?

Might be more features on your hearing aids draining battery, higher volumes if your hearing has deteriorated at all, listening to more noise throughout the day or using Bluetooth more?

I used to have a noisy job and it certainly made a difference. I have rechargeable though.

Yes! I felt like the first I used my hearing aids they lasted for a couple weeks now I only get a week out of them. My perception  of time isn’t the best so I thought I was going nuts. Additionally my hearing aids are linked by Bluetooth to my phone and I use them a lot so I figured it made sense they only last a week

As batteries age or humidity changes, life drops fast. Could also be firmware updates or more Bluetooth streaming. Try a fresh pack or different brand to compare.",2025-10-31 03:14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1okjxo3/battery_life_shorter/

You should probably make an appointment with an audiologist and they can explain your results. 


Normal hearing is between 0-25db so 15db is fine.

That does sound below typical thresholds. Since you already have tinnitus, it’s worth getting a full audiogram from an audiologist.",2025-10-30 15:48:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ok3auc/did_a_hearing_test_in_todays_lab/

I am hard of hearing beginning in my 30s. It’s tough, I won’t lie to you. It can be very lonely, at least for me, because it’s hard for me to hear in group settings.

However, it truly has made me focus on the type of people that will be supportive of me regardless, which has shown me the type of people I want to have in my life. 

If you do have hearing loss, the most important thing you can do is to get tested. I know firsthand it’s scary as hell, but if you leave hearing loss without treatment (whether that’s steroids, surgery, or hearing aids), your hearing nerve and brain will get used to not having the sound input. That can cause long-lasting damage to both.

So please get tested. Cry and scream at the results if you need to. But please know that having something “wrong” with you, if that’s what the test shows… simply means you’re human. 

Not better. Not worse. Just human.

I had to start therapy and was prescribed Zoloft. Both really helped!

Have they tried putting a tube in your ear with the pressure yet?

Let me ask a few questions, if I might. 

When did this dysfunction occur? Was it a sudden onset? If so, can you tell me the circumstances surrounding it?

I too have auditory processing disorder (ANSD) and all my hearing tests were normal and I finally got to know about ANSD after a ABR/bera test.
For me too, over the years (especially after covid and resulting very limited social interaction) it has become just a little bit difficult to understand people and ask them again and again (specially in noisy enviornment with more than 55 db of background noise). My Audiologist also recommended a hearing device to me.
I guess hearing issues does form a broad spectrum and we all can share and learn from each other's perspective and experience 😃

Plus you’ll prolly still find usefull/relatable info

I’ve never heard the term Auditory Processing Disorder, but it sounds like me. 

I lost 40% of the hearing in my left ear in 1995. But the loss was to the tone test. When it comes to identifying the sound, or speech, or what direction the sound comes from, I can’t do that with the left ear. If the right ear is brought into play, my comprehension score comes up, but still not anywhere near 100%. I also still can’t tell what direction sound comes from. 

Is that what ANSD is?

I was born an estimated 50% deaf in my right ear, although I’d debate that I’m more 75%, sounds that’d be painfully loud are like soft voices. But my left ear can hear fine, although I’ve admittedly given myself tinnitus from years of poor choices with earbud volume. 

Especially since you need hearing aids, I think the label would fit for you. I don’t even have hearing aids right now, although lord knows I’m trying.

Audioprocessing is a neurological condition that affects how your brain processes audio. Physically, you still have the ability  to hear. 

Hearing loss  is physical. Loss of hearing.  

2 separate things. They actually have a reddit for APD, though. 

I don't think you need permission from strangers on the internet it's a free country. 

You do what feels best 👌🏼

That is absolutely not true. 

Not all processing disorders are related to auditory dysfunction. 

For example, you can be dyslexic and deaf. You can have sensory textile processing disorders and be deaf. You can have cognitive dissonance disorders and be deaf. 
There’s a whole SLEW of processing disorders that have and don’t have anything to do with the auditory system. 
The issue is there is not a set of official guidelines in the ICD-11 Consult or the DSM5-TR, in fact, currently Processing Disorders and APD are not included in either due to a whole slew of factors. 

(Mainly, they don’t know jack shit about ANY of these so they can’t properly explain, diagnose nor treat them. If you haven’t LIVED or experienced a processing disorder, how, I ask, will you understand it?    You don’t. )",2025-10-28 22:59:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oioaz7/im_unsure_if_i_am_allowed_to_be_apart_of_the/
1oil0cp,hardofhearing,Can't find reliable sound-sensor/vibration system,"I've been looking for a bed-shaker system that will alert me to sounds. I've tried two or three models, but they all have this really frustrating and confusing wrinkle: the sound sensors that transmit to them only detect LONG sounds. They often seem to be marketed as ""baby cry sensors.""

That is, they'll detect most ringtones, or a person going ""AHHHHHHHHH!"", but they won't detect a person *shouting* my name (which is just one syllable). More worryingly, I found that the one I'm using currently won't even reliably detect a smoke detector going off, even when the smoke detector is right next to the sensor!! Presumably this is because the smoke detector beeps are very short and/or high-pitched. I have no idea why this ""long sounds only"" feature is a thing. Maybe they want to protect from waking you when a door opens or closes? But hell, if it'd disturb a hearing person, I'd like it to disturb me!

I know they have hearing impaired phones with a large speaker but I’m unsure if those will be any better than just yelling into his ear. I know the earbuds work. I’m also wondering if I should be considering over ear headphones that way he doesn’t have to take his hearing aids out and tell people “hold on” every time someone calls, but I know in the past overear headphones for watching TV have interfered with his hearing aids and caused them to shut off, unsure if that’s because the over ear headphones for his TV were wireless though. So I just want to keep things as simple/reliable as possible while also not damaging his hearing. And considering his hearing is already damages are there are volume limitations I should set up/get a pair of headphones that CANT go past a certain db reading to further damage his hearing? 

Furthermore, if this works out I’m wondering if I should be thinking about alternatives for his hearing aid situation in general. He can’t hear at all on the phone and he can barely hear in person, so I’m wondering if I should look into/make a setup that is basically just earbuds permanently in place of hearing aids but with a Microphone strapped to his hip or whatever (possibly a directional microphone that points where he is looking/at the person he’s talking to?) that then feeds to his hearing aids? And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

I’m just past the point of wanting to go through the Dr because he’s went to this Dr many times and cannot hear a damned thing through his hearing aids yet I use a random pair of earbuds from home and he could hear clear as day. So I’m hesitant to burn 10+ hours going back and forth to Dr to get new hearing aids and spend a bunch of money for something proprietary that might not even work.

I think he needs a new doctor to check his hearing if possible

See a new audiologist. Why keep going back if you're not getting what you want out of it.

If he is able,  transcription apps allow us to l read what is being said irt....  A way to keep communication open until his audiologist helps

Another vote for a new doctor. 

When you say Hearing Doctor, I want to be sure we are on the same page. I’m talking about an ENT, or a licensed Audiologist with a partnership with an ENT, at the least. Please don’t take him to one of the mass market hearing aid places. I’m referring to Beltone, Miracle Ear, Clear Tone etc. 

I’m sorry to say there are too many people out there that don’t want to invest the extra time it takes to work with some of our older seniors. Your Grandfather is a member of the greatest generation that ever lived, and we all owe them a debt of gratitude. A little extra time spent working with them sometimes results in hearing about history we didn’t know.

New doctor/audiologist.

There's transcription apps. **Live Transcribe** is popular and works well. I have one too but its not out in eu yet.

Earbuds like for a walkman or amplifier? Or AirPods? If it's the latter, if that works hey, I mean not really recommended but ppl are doing that. If it's the former, eh. Do they have costco where you are? They'll do an audiogram with their in house audiologists and sell you a hearing aid and not an amplifier.

They have multiple (hardware) transcription devices for phones too. I have moderate hearing loss and I rarely have any idea what anyone is saying on the phone. I just put it on speaker and tell people to feel free to shout. I'm ok on zoom etc since I speechread.

&gt;And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

Nothing works in a crowded room, it's why I won't generally wear hearing aids. That was the only thing that mattered for where I used to work (teaching). It was listening to a cacophony of overlapping human speech. Focusing on a single speaker was like picking out water drops in the rain. When you amplify that it's just a louder cacophony, not easier to discriminate sounds or speakers.

A lot of hearing aids just do not work well either and many audiologists are just glorified (hearing) appliance salespeople. I think you found one of those w/your grandfather.

Hope that helps and lots of luck! *fingers crossed*

It's wild how regular earbuds sometimes work better than expensive hearing aids. Just be careful with the volume so it doesn't blast his ears even if he can't hear well. You could also look into OTCs. They're kind of the middle ground between regular earbuds and full-on prescription hearing aids. My FIL has the audien ion pro and they've been amazing for everyday stuff without the constant doctor trips.

I wonder if government phones might have some of those helpful hearing impaired phones I've never heard of that but I'm about to ask them if they do if you have those government phones where you are I would try that too but definitely a new audiologist if this one isn't helping it's a lot of searching around for the perfect one but I'm sure you'll find maybe a better one closer",2025-10-27 19:07:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ohnf3v/95_year_old_grandfather_cant_hear_almost_anything/
1ohmx4i,hardofhearing,System for home emergencies to wake up someone hard of hearing?,"Hi,
To cut a long story short, I’m looking for some sort of system or device that can wake someone up who is hard of hearing. This would be for emergencies only when they are needed in the night. It needs to be set off by someone else in a separate room, for example by a phone call or a button etc.  They’re severely hard of hearing without a hearing aid (which they don’t sleep with). I’ve tried looking for some sort of vibrating wrist band but I can’t find anything that can be set off by a phone call or button. 
Any recommendations?
Thanks

you want a company like this... https://bellman.com/en/our-solutions/visit-smart-home/ they specialise in hard of hearing alerting systems. any audiologist should help or follow their link to stockists. you need a package of things though... not cheap but robust, simple and effective. bed shakers, flashing lights. etc. can be linked to phones.. also good for smoke alarms!!

I find a smart watch to be the best.

I use a smartwatch in place of an alarm clock.  The vibrations wake me up.

You can get a disk that vibrates to put olunder your pillow, and that's connected to the alarm systems. Some people have lights that will flash too.

It's one of the service packs I was offered from ""disability central"" here. I have not felt the need for it personally though.",2025-10-27 18:49:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ohmx4i/system_for_home_emergencies_to_wake_up_someone/
1oh8iyj,hardofhearing,Can I get a hearing test without a doctor ordering it?,"Hi,

Does anyone know if there is a way that I can get a hearing test without a doctor's order? I know I can do that at Costco, but they only let you get one every six months, and I last had a hearing test four months ago. But if I’ve experienced sudden hearing loss now, I need to get treatment *now*. Not two months from now. Also, if I get a hearing test without a doctor's order, my medical insurance probably won’t pay for it. So I'm also wondering how much a hearing test actually costs, if I have to pay out of pocket. Thanks!

[댓글]
For sudden unexplained hearing loss your dr should get you in right away. Outside of Costco i don’t know whereas you could to get a hearing test not approved by a dr. I think the amount it cost can vary state to state so to be on the safe side you should google your area

I have no idea what the situation state-side is (where I presume you are?) but in Canada I was definitely able to just call up a hearing clinic and ask them for an appointment directly (I didn't have a GP at the time).

You need to see an ENT, not just an audiologist at a hearing aid shop. Call your insurance to see if you need Referral

I walked into the local clinic and said I think I'm going deaf ... No doctors no papers they set me up with an appointment. Now may differ based on location though

I've never had a doctor order a hearing test recently before 2020. I have been the one ordering them. I go to the office that deals with my hearing aids or the hospital where I had my CI surgery.

The hearing aid places will give you a free hearing test to sell you hearing aids, they are audiologists. You just have to be prepared to walk away &amp; finagle your results. That’s a quick, free answer before you see your ENT (not a substitute for)

Try free phone apps or Costco

You need to call your insurance company and ask them!",2025-10-27 07:56:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oh8iyj/can_i_get_a_hearing_test_without_a_doctor/

Please and thank you for anyone's advice 

[댓글]
I have the oticon ones with the actual hearing aid that sits behind the ear and the molded earpiece that goes into the ear. It is quite easy just to pull that bit out. —as opposed to hearing aids that are just little buds or something.

Anyway, so Yes, absolutely I will just pull the ear piece out and let them hang until whatever foolishness is over with.

Edit: I don’t know why, but your question reminded me of a story about Ian McKellan. He’d gone to see a play where one of his friends was starring. Afterwards he was giving the usual praise about how much he enjoyed it, and the friend replied, “We could tell you enjoyed it, you didn’t even take out your hearing aids!” Idk why that tickled me so much. Maybe bc I’d never thought about being “caught” doing it!

Ugh, loud sudden noises are rough. You can try asking your audiologist to tweak your compression settings. It can help dampen sharp spikes like that. Personally, I use audien ion pro and they seem a bit less reactive to sharp noise compared to my older ones. They got quick-switch profiles for noisy places so I can just tap to tone things down.

I really only wear mine to work or to situations where I need to understand every single word. The world is so noisy. If I'm just going out to run errands or at home I will typically leave them out and rely on lip reading and asking for clarification. I can still hear lots of things but it's easier to tune out. I do get easily overwhelmed when I wear them in a loud environment. I will turn them all the way down, or like the other comment said just pop the speakers out of my ear canals

If the sounds are bothering you, turn your hearing aids down or off! That's what I do; there's no use hearing when it does more harm than good, especially for loud noises that can actually damage your hearing in the long run.

Hearing aids don't help me in most situations- im HOH in one ear- it actually overstimulates me in situations where there is more than one person or child talking

I work in an upper elementary school in SPED. I’ve absolutely taken my hearing aids out while dealing with a student who is escalated and being very loud. It’s damaging my hearing by leaving them in, not to mention probably going to trigger a vertigo attack for me. Maybe it’s rude, but tbf I don’t think my students have ever noticed it in the moment.

I am in the same situation.  I had my audiologist set one of the buttons on my hearing aides to mute so I can quickly mute when a loud sound happens.  I live in the city so the ambulances and fire trucks are super loud.  When I take the subway I wear Sony earphones over the ear kind over my hearing aides.  I don’t even turn them on or anything ,  just having them up over my hears is enough to dull the screeching subway trains.  I also have a custom “ calm” setting that I made for noisy situations where I still want to hear but way softer like noisy restaurants or my office where the loud overhead AC vents drive me nuts..

I struggle with this situation - and am not convinced that wearing hearing aids in loud areas doesn't further damage your ears.  Doesn't the loud noise you no longer hear still damage your hearing??

I recently opted to put earplugs in my ears when out on long walks rather than wear my hearing aids.  The every increasing traffic noise has been too much for me - I stopped looking forward to walks.   So now I just leave hearing aids at home and plug my ears with those simple foam ear plugs to reduce the decibels.  I can still hear the hum of traffic and my head swivels around paying attention to the traffic, people, cyclists etc around me.  My ears no longer hurt after a long walk, since I cut out the over exposure to noise. 

I don't believe that my decision to remove hearing aids and wear ear plugs is ideal  - but it still doesn't make sense that wearing aids in loud environments doesn't further harm my hearing; especially when my ears physically hurt after lengthy exposure to environment.  It's not like you can quickly cover your ears when a car or store alarm goes off.

I am interested in this post and look forward to reading all comments.

I honestly just pop open the battery compartments so the hearing aids *block* noise instead

Unfortunately the answer you don’t want to hear is……. You get what you pay for, I have a profound hearing loss and have worn hearing aides since I was 22.  I am now 56, and have grown through all of the technological advancements.  Set aside the arguments that you shouldn’t have to pay this much to hear and just accept reality, it is what it is.
Get the absolute highest technology from a reputable doctor of audiology and you will find this day and age has automatic noise reduction built in.  They will automatically turn down the volume when sensing the incoming volume is a certain percentage above ambient sound.  Obviously it’s more complicated than that but we don’t need to know the physics, we just want to hear.  You will find it strange at first when it happens because it will also give you a perceived pressure change that takes some getting used to.
Make sure you get quality custom ear molds and a quality audiologist that will be patient with you.  After I get my new ones it typically takes about 6 weeks of at east once a week appointments for the audiologist to get them dialed in for my use.  If they are not willing, they are not worth your money.  Remember, if your audiologist is not hearing impaired themselves, they do not know what it’s like to have this affliction.

You should speak to Elivania Abreu, Fonoaudióloga

You have a high frequency hearing loss. Search for ""speech banana"", map your loss,  and you can see the speech you will miss . Your audiologist should be able to give you an explamation. If they can't,  find a new one!.

The line in red goes down and then up a little bit, the other line goes down not as rapidly.

In short, you can hear (roughly) normally in most frequencies, but you don't hear higher pitched sounds nearly as well. Your ears are roughly the same, but your left ear is your better ear. This may mean you have trouble hearing certain speech sounds and quiet high pitched noises like electricity whine, whispering, sounds from small animals and insects, etc. It doesn't mean that you *can't* hear those noises, just that you have more difficulty than the typical person. 

I'm not an audiologist, just hard of hearing myself, so I can't say whether hearing aids would be needed, but if your audiologist/hearing aid tech recommends them, I would look into it if financially feasible. Unaided hearing loss has been linked to increased rates of dementia in later life, so it does have implications for brain health.

Looks like mine from 5 years ago.

The line of the left is percentage of sound heard compared to normal hearing. The negative # is better than normal. The numbers on the top are frequency starting from very low to medium sound, drums, vibration, low notes pretty well but I can't hear higher so high women's voices. (ie soprano}, become indisputably non existent.

Disclaimer: I am not an audiologist, but from my understanding as someone who has studied audiology in undergrad,
You have a bilateral high frequency hearing loss that is slightly asymmetrical. The degree in your right ear is moderately severe at high frequencies (over 4k Hz), and the degree in your left is is moderate at high frequencies (over 4k Hz). At all other frequencies (4k and below) you have normal hearing. It looks like you only had air conduction tested, and without also testing bone conduction, the type of loss cannot be determined for certain.

I want this hearing : (

X-axis is the frequency of the sound.


Y-axis is how loud that frequency has to be in order for you to hear it.


The shaded area is a normal range of hearing. Anything in the white area indicates hearing loss in that frequency. The lower you go, the worse the hearing loss is.


You have moderate high frequency hearing loss.",2025-10-24 19:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1of7maq/can_you_explain_my_audiogram_in_detail_if_possible/

1ode1rg,hardofhearing,Sudden hearing loss after blowing my nose – anyone had this and recovered?,"I’m 25 and a today I was congested from a cold. I tried to pop my ears by blowing gently into my closed nose — and I felt a small “pop” in my left ear.

Right after that, I got dizzy, nauseous, and even threw up once. Since then, my left ear feels full, I hear almost nothing from it, and there’s constant ringing.

I went to the ENT today and got diagnosed with:

Sudden hearing loss (hypoacusis) due to barotrauma

The eardrum looks fine (not ruptured), but they confirmed significant hearing loss on the left side. Tomorrow I’m going for another hearing test and likely steroid treatment.

Has anyone here experienced sudden hearing loss after pressure / blowing your nose, and did your hearing recover?
How long did it take, and did you do any specific treatments (steroids, oxygen therapy, etc.)?

[댓글]
It very possible that this can be an issue that can be corrected by having tubes (or a tube) put in ear(s).

Can you describe what you hear? Is it muffled/stuffy? Like it seems like your ears are suddenly stuffed?

Go to emergency, if there is any chance that the loss is due to lack of blood/oxygen to the ear, the longer you wait the higher chance of permanent hearing loss.

I had the same issue, after like 4 days it turns  out to be pressure difference between the ear and the environment. I was also sick, maybe my ear was infected and it cleared itself

Could be a round window fistula

Sudden hearing loss like this should be seen as soon as possible by a dr. According to many credible medical sites  (NIH in the UK, Harvard medical and Mayo clinic in the US) you have about a10-14 day window to address this (assuming it continues) without at least some permanent hearing loss resulting. The longer you delay, the more likely so e or all hearing loss will be unrecoverable.",2025-10-22 17:04:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ode1rg/sudden_hearing_loss_after_blowing_my_nose_anyone/

I want to try lip reading but I’m not able to in my job as I have to look at a bunch of screens while people are talking to me. I already had a complaint from this woman who shouted at me from across the place and I didn’t hear her and when I explained my situation she said “we’ll fix your hearing then” lady if I could I would mate but luckily my boss is so lovely she went over to the woman and asked her not to speak to me like that so I am very thankful for my colleagues and managers.

I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, I don’t have any resources to get to my closest doctor and my mum won’t drive me 😢😢 that just puts out any hearing aids for me but oh well I think I can manage without them I would just like tips on how to keep focus on people and lip reading!! Thank you 

[댓글]
You need to get a dr. There very little that can be done until you know what your hearing is. Medical help is a right in most countries and not getting a child medical attention is neglect and not legal in most places.



















Furthermore lip reading is not an exact science  and while there are classes for lip reading and sign language if you don’t have the resources to get to the dr i don’t see how you would get to lip reading classes.

Agreed, find a way to get a hearing test whether it be someone driving you or an uber. You can try to work on auditory training to hear in the presence of background noise, such as listening to an audiobook while they’re another source of sound like a tv show on to try to train your brain to filter out extraneous noise. but ultimately, hearing test is your better move

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Like the others, I urge you to prioritize getting to the doctor as soon as possible, preferably to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist, but in the very least to a primary care physician, understanding that you likely will need to follow up with an ENT. I know it’s difficult to take time off for work for medical appointments, but some hearing loss is treatable. Also, some hearing losses need to be treated as soon as possible for the best chance of recovering hearing. 

Lip reading is a helpful context clue for understanding what’s been said, but it’s more an aid than a solution, as many words look similar (e.g., “I love you” and “olive juice”). There are live closed captioning apps (system accessibility settings, apps like Live Transcribe) that can assist with in person and telephone communication. 

One difficulty it sounds like you may have is communicating when your vision has to be directed toward screens (unless you can have a transcription program running at the bottom of the screen that detects and transcribes nearby speech). Sighted deaf and hard of hearing individuals often are highly dependent upon their vision for communication, and adapting to a newly acquired hearing loss takes considerable visual cuing at first. 

Again, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Prioritize your medical treatment, then work on finding the best communication options for you. There may be support services for the deaf and hearing impaired in your area, and it would be good to reach out to them too. 

Best of luck!

[EDIT: Wanted to add that hearing aids can be life changing for some people experiencing hearing loss that can be remediated. You should definitely try them if given the opportunity. They might be the best solution for you. However, do keep in mind that noisy environments create challenges no matter what solution you’re using.]",2025-10-22 16:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oddo6v/any_tips/

After two years of light use, the power switch broke so I can't turn it *off*. I didn't drop it, it didn't get wet, it just...stopped working. Phonak is charging $200 to fix something that cost $2000 new.

Having a remote mic is nice but the construction quality is inexcusable for something this pricy.

If it happened to you, it probably happened to others too.  Complain to the business you purchased it from and to Phonak.  If they do not provide a suitable solution, post here again so others know to avoid it.  I couldn't afford it when I  tried it a few years ago and certainly would not consider it again if they cannot support it properly, it's definitely an expensive accessory .

That's ridiculous. You'd think something that expensive would last more than two years. Maybe see if CS will do a goodwill repair but if not, there are better-built options for way less. My MIL's audien ion pro aids cost under $600 and have survived daily wear and tear no problem.

This was my feedback to them when they invited me to a Roger users focus group. The difference between the Roger Table Mic and Table Mic 2 is astounding. The first generation for me is still going strong, battery lasts ages but the Table Mic 2, after just 2 years, I have 1 (out of 4) that no longer takes charge. 

Knowing Phonak, it is planned obsolescence. If your device breaks within the 2 first years though, they just replace it. Had this happen with a Roger Pen and a Roger On.

Please DM me with details of your Roger.  I may have one for sale, and am happy to negotiate.",2025-10-22 14:16:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1od9ibm/phonak_roger_one_rant/

The idea: a device called ""Touchestra"" — a small board that represents an orchestra map, divided into sections (percussion, strings, woodwinds, brass, etc.). When a section starts playing, its corresponding sector lights up and begins vibrating at its own unique frequency.

And before I proceed with any further work, I need your feedback!!

2. Do you attend classical music concerts? If yes/no — why?

The problem is orchestra. You can pull that off for like 3 instruments. 4 gets to be a lot. 

There's no way to parse out an orchestra. Would be too much to make sense of. Maybe a board thing like for sports, but I don't see the appeal.

Watch Mr. Holland's Opus for how to make music accessible to deaf people.

A new way to be accessible! I have a friend who built a platform that vibrates to the base of music. I like it a lot even though I feel the base (he doesn't). I've told him he needs to build something for people like me who have lost the high frequencies. He hasn't had the time. He's making music accessible in other ways now.

Look up ""haptic"" shirt + deaf. Also Opus Sound Bed.  There are also Ayurvedic versions made of wood with strings underneath the practitioner strums.",2025-10-19 00:17:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oabq2k/the_idea_of_a_device_that_allows_you_to_feel/
1oa2nue,hardofhearing,A victim of my fathers hearing aids,"Dear Hard of Hearing Community,

Edit: I've the the same question worded differently and as I'm new to this I didn't know that it was pretty important, but should have realized that it is: the model I believe is rexton reach r-li t, it things that go in the ears are custom fitted. All of this has been done through public healthcare (Denmark) so I don't know that much but at least I think the fit is to standard but would most likely have been even better done in the private sector. Finally I've never heard the sound when his ears are covered all though that doesn't happen often, I've only heard it when he is messing with the software settings on his app and he never adjust anything sound wise on hearing aid themselves. Thank you for all the curious questions and suggestions to far


I’m reaching out as a victim of my father’s recently prescribed hearing aids, hoping that someone here or maybe a relative of a hard of hearing person can answer my question.

So, he got these hearing aids that he *does* need. They’re fairly ""modern"", which means they come with a lovely little app that lets him adjust the volume, sensitivity, and all sorts of other settings.

Here’s my problem—and the reason I feel like a victim of them:  
Why the F@$# do they have to make a horrendous sound every single time he makes even a single microadjustment?!

Why does it have to sound like a thousand grasshoppers screeching right next to my ear, in a tone so high that any not hard of hearing person above the age 40 probably can’t even hear it?  
Why does my hearing have to suffer just because he’s tweaking his hearing aids through some app?!

Please, I need this explained. I'm losing my mind 

—A 24-year-old victim of his father’s hearing aids

  
P.S**.** He’s a 61-year-old fiddler, so he loves to adjust the app often, also when I’m visiting, forgetfull of (having commented on the horrendous sound) and obviously unable to hear the sound currently MESSING WITH MY MIND. I feel so alone in my suffering, being an only child and thus the only one in relative nearness to him WHO IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO HEAR IT.

[댓글]
Please mention the make &amp; model number of the hearing-aids he has, as this enables pinpoint research of the issue, whether it's limited to just this model, or across different makes etc

They shouldn't be making any sound if they are in his ear. If there is feedback happening while he's wearing them, they are not fit correctly and he should return to his audiologist for an adjustment. (Or he is doing something like cupping his ear).

Feedback.  It’s a speaker and a microphone very close together.  If it gets covered at all, the sound coming from the speaker bounces back into the microphone.  It’s the same as when you hold a microphone up to its speaker on a stage.  Or when two people have their mics on in the same room on a zoom call.

When I was first dating, it was a fun proximity alert for how close my boyfriend and I were dancing lol.

They can sometimes be adjusted to not have so much feedback, but they are limited by how much amplification is needed for the patient.

When my grandmother got older, she couldn’t hear the squealing, so she’d sit there with it low level squealing until someone told her to fix it.

Sounds like a poor fitting process from the audiologist. What you hear is called feedback, and you will also hear it when hugging him or when something covers the microphone. Basically, it’s sound leaking from the speaker to the microphone and creates an unintended feedback loop causing the squeaking sound. 

Modern hearing aids are pretty good at minimizing feedback. However, it is important that sound doesn’t leak through the piece in the ear. For mild hearing losses, sometimes domes are good enough. In your case I’d make sure your father doesn’t use domes, but custom made ear molds. The sound actually becomes better with well fitted ear molds.

Go back to the audiologist and discuss the problem.

Also, a more important thing is that you need to understand that your father still have hearing loss. Hearing aids don’t really solve anything. Yes, they amplify the right frequencies so that we can hear them, but they cannot make the sound any clearer. This means that they help in quiet environments at short distances to the speaker, if people speak clearly and you see the speaker clearly. It’s up to you to change your view on communication. Never speak from a different room, make sure lighting and listening conditions are good. It’s fatiguing to listen even with hearing aids, since the cognition is used to just identifying and processing sounds, instead of being available for information processing. Keep that in mind, and always be flexible to make communication easy and less dependent on listening.

So it only makes the feedback sound when he's adjusting it? He's not bringing his hands anywhere near his hearing-aid when adjusting the settings? If he is, then the cupping effect will cause feedback. If he's not, then there's an issue with the hearing-aids and/or app that needs to be reported to the manufacturer/provider of the devices.

In my experience this kind of feedback comes from either handling or touching the hearing aids, a poor fit (perhaps the domes are too big or small) or a buildup of earwax. 

I’ve also had this problem to a degree when I need a haircut and my hair touches the aids.

Are his hearing aids custom aids? There’s a manufacturer that does programme and volume changes to the custom aids by making the phone emit a specific pattern of high frequency chirp. The aids “hear” this sound and execute the change in volume. This is to get around the fact that not all customs have a Bluetooth receiver, so as to make the aids smaller.

I also get a short beeping sound when I switch my program setting for both my hearing aid and my processor, unless the batteries are low.

my hearing aids do this too with any little adjustment and even to me the sounds Is so high screeching and annoying idk why it does that maybe you can turn it off ?

Oh lord. 

FEEDBACK. 

It isn’t just your worst nightmare, imagine being HIM. yeah. He hears it too. 
Also imagine the single most annoying jingle you’ve ever heard. Got it? Yeah? Now imagine having to hear that jingle play every single time you put your hearing aids on because that is the very thing that you hear when you turn your hearing aids on that jingle is what is programmed into the hearing aid as the start up to you that the hearing aids are on every single time you want to hear you start your day to the most annoying sound you have ever heard yes yes that’s what you have to look forward to as you get older and you start to lose your hearing. It’s inevitable because everybody starts to lose their hearing. It’s a biological evolutionary process.

I was born with severe nerve darkness, bilateral both ears diagnosed at 18 months. The doctors told my parents I would never learn to hear. I would never learn to communicate. I would never understand sound at 18 months old. I was with hearing aids in both ears and started intense. Speech therapy I went four days a week for three hours, one day, four hours the next day, alternating on the last day of the week until I was 4 1/2 years old, my speech is absolutely perfect to the point that doctors do not believe that I was born without language never had language never had hearing. I went into profound deafness in my late 30s and could no longer use hearing aids. I got a implant in 2022 and it is the best thing that has ever happened. Hearing aids are horrible horrible horrible I cannot recommend hearing aids to anyone. All they do is amplify sounds they give you feedback they are just awful. They are awful if I have been able to get a cochlear implant much earlier in life I would have done so that difference between the two is  astronomical; hearing aids are absolutely worthless and this is coming from a person that has had lifelong hearing loss. I have never experienced life any other way and I am telling you hearing aids are just horrible.",2025-10-18 18:03:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oa2nue/a_victim_of_my_fathers_hearing_aids/

[댓글]
That’s really a discussion for you and your audiologist. I’m not a specialist but in my unprofessional opinion I imagine there would be some improvement if you had hearing aids.

Do you feel like your quality of life is affected? That's the main thing. Also you may not realize how much your missing till you try them out. Go chat with an audiologist and see what they recommend.

This looks like you could benefit from hearing aids but like fallspector says, talk to a professional.

Blue is usually the left ear and red is the right. I’m pretty sure that’s universal but happy to be corrected. I’ve had HAs for years and the colour has always been Red-right and Blue-left.

I bet hearing aids would help. They aren't hearing miracles but they would make a difference. My life is easier with them than without them. I have workarounds for hearing limits and that makes a difference too. 

[https://hearinglosslive.com/unrealistic-expectations-hearing-aids/](https://hearinglosslive.com/unrealistic-expectations-hearing-aids/)

I have only around 40 decibels loss as of a few years ago, like others said, you need to ask your audiologist. 

But one time I got tested at Costco and they gave me hearing aids to try while I shop, I was blown away at everything I was missing. Unfortunately for me, every audiologist recommends I have many channels and the cheapest was like $5k-$6k pre-pandemic. I have congenital and acquired hearing loss and they call it ""cookie bite"" because my audiogram looks like a big semicircle, like someone bit it. That's why I need many channels to have more adjustability.

You could test some and see what it is like.

Looks a little like mine from memory and I can't hear shit

Someone’s already said it but talk to your audiologist

We are not doctors - talk to an audiologist

It depends on your hearing. A test from an audiologist is the best way to know. Hearing aids help some people, but aren’t always needed.

As an audiologist, yes

Your questions aren’t useful at all, I’m afraid. I don’t think you understand what it is like to live with deafness or hearing loss. You need to read up on that. 

* Accommodations such as interpreters, CART, external microphones and so on should be available in a class. If someone can’t volunteer in class, it’s not solved by design, but by assuring better accommodations and understanding of how to structure the communication. (Read about Nyle DiMarcos school experience in Deaf Utopia, for example.) The inclusion in schools is a much bigger problem than design.

* Install hearing loops and ensure hearing aids have a t-tool.

* Make information and communication visible.

Research the potential accoustics...type of floor, walls, etc. I would prefer a room with excellent acoustics to any design.",2025-10-16 12:57:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o85gbd/please_help_with_my_uni_assignment/

1o6owmt,hardofhearing,Hearing test results and hearing aids at 27,"Hi! I just wanted to get on here and see if anyone had a similar “story” and test results! 

I, and all my friends, noticed my lack of hearing around 16 yrs old. Since then it has been a constant conversation through school, meeting my husband, and at work. Well, 10+ years later I finally go take a hearing test. I was SHOCKED when the audiologist recommended two hearing aids. Just wondering if anyone has a similar “cookie bite” and if you have noticed any more decreases throughout the years. 

I understand that since this is genetic, I really can’t base anything off of others experiences. But purely curious! 

Thanks in advance!

Cookie bite here, similar story as you.  In my late teens people kept telling me to go get the wax cleaned out of my ears and whatnot, heh.  I knew it was there, my wife and I joked that I was the eyes and she was the ears, but I didn't deal with it until 45 years old and it was really affecting both my work and personal life.  I did feel like it was getting worse. 

Hearing aids have been life-changing, I really didn't even realize just how much of the world I was missing.

I have cookie bite loss, I don’t know how much loss there’s really been aside from the typical slight loss in the 8k range, which for me is still above average (?!). My hearing loss was first suspected in second grade, but my parents never really followed through about it until I was 17 and got a pair of hearing aids that really worked for me. They help so much because I always say “I wasn’t meant to hear people”, as my loss is focused similarly around where most speech falls. The difference with them in and out is day and night. At home it doesn’t matter so much, but being able to function at work and having conversations is so worth having hearing aids for. If you can get a pair, I think you’ll find them worth it. I found myself much less exhausted because I wasn’t trying so hard to hear all of the time.

Oh wow, yours is like perfect cookie bite. I have that as well, i had hearing aids in elementary school, hated them and quit by third grade, tried again in high school, gave up within a year. In my early 30s i finally admitted i was struggling more, and got another hearing test done. My cookie bite is now a cookie bit, the ends have evened out to a pretty steady across the board loss with a smaller dip in the middle, but the upside is hearing aid technology is wayyy better!

Welcome to the club buddy! I’ve had cookie bite as a teen and my chart is a little more C shaped but about the same :)

I don’t have a deaf community I’m ingrained in or have a job that can accommodate me easily (I’m a teacher) so HA it is and it’s been a life changer for me to be able to work in the hearing world.

Mine looks almost exactly like yours but more symmetrical. I have noticed a bit of a decline since I started wearing aids and have had them modified a bit. I didn’t start wearing them until about 5 years ago (37) but probably needed them in my 20s. I haven’t figured out which side of my family the hearing loss is from. I really benefitted from aids in conversations. Good luck!

Cookie bite here. Mine has been steady for about 15 years.

TIL of cookie bite hearing loss! I thought it was so weird you had loss in the middle frequencies instead of high like most.

Just curious from the professionals, who is able to adapt better to understanding speech with hearing aids?  Those with a cookie bite loss or those with high frequency loss?  I'm observing the comments about how much hearing aids helped the cookie bites. I'm a high frequency loss person but it's still a struggle even with the aids in both ears. So, just wondering what the professionals say?

33. Also cookie bite. Had hearing issues my whole life and got hearing aids just over a month ago. It’s been a huge improvement in my day to day.

Basically same story (34f) - sister kinda always knew, then high school it was fairly obvious/a joke that I was deaf. There were a lot of signs in my 20s, e.g wondered why phones never turned up to an understandable volume 😂, starting to need subtitles for the tv. 

It was shockingly apparent at the start of COVID-19. Couldn’t hear a word through the masks🫠 got hearing tests and the technician was so confused “normally the line goes straight up that way or  that way if it’s not perfect… 👀” (went to proper audiologist and ENT soon after).

1o653ju,hardofhearing,"For my fellow HoH Android users - I made a free app like Live Transcribe, but with the 'Save' button we always needed.","Hey everyone,

Like many of you folks, I'm Hard of Hearing. While I think Google's Live Transcribe is a fantastic tool, I always got frustrated by one thing: I couldn't save the transcript. It was useless for practical things like taking down my mother's grocery list, because the text would disappear as soon as I closed the app.

I've seen this sentiment shared here before, and I was especially inspired to finish this up after seeing the great app a developer made for his HoH partner on iOS last month. I wanted to make sure us Android users had a great option, too. 

So, I built Transcriboar. It's live now and it's 100% free.

Link to Transcriboar on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neonsnake.transcriboar

Think of it as Live Transcribe, but with all the features we need to actually use the text later:

* Save transcripts to your phone
* Edit and Rename saved files
* Share the text with other apps
* Print directly

And, of course, a cool boar logo, which was a significant feature I felt Live Transcribe also lacked.

Most importantly, it's truly free and private. Everything is stored locally on your device. There is no cloud, no data recording, and no expensive AI subscription. I used the same fast, free, and reliable API that Google already provides.

Please be kind, I'm just one guy who built this in his kitchen. I wasn't compensated and I don't make any money from this. I just wanted to build something that would genuinely help me and, hopefully, others in our community.

Thanks for checking it out.

P.S. / Important Info:

* Privacy Policy: https://neonsnake.com/privacy.html
* More Info: https://neonsnake.com/transcriboar.html
* Availability Note: Currently, the app is live in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. I'm working to expand this to many more countries very soon

You are an amazing one guy who built this in your kitchen. Maybe the best

Thank you so much.  Transcription was so critical during my husband illness and it was frustrating not to be able to have the conversion to refer back to. 
I just downloaded the app and will try it out tomorrow.

this is an excellent initiative and an example of your brilliance!

Hello! It's not available in my country (Malaysia) yet but I just wanted to say a HUGE THANK YOU for putting in the time and your expertise to build this app. I saw the same post last month on the iOS app and totally wished someone would do the same for us Android users haha...
But truly, life already can be so challenging and it's kind &amp; giving people like you who make such a difference in our HoH community.

FYI just pushed an update to the play store for the Android 11 folks, should be out (hopefully) by tomorrow-ish.

* Fixed Transcription on Android 11 devices, works reliably on tested devices
* Resolved an issue that prevented the microphone from starting on certain Android 11 phones.
* Minor Performance improvements and bug fixes

Thanks for all the patience and feedback!

1o5trpx,hardofhearing,Living with reverse-slope hearing loss: worried about progression!,"Hey people!

I (28M) was diagnosed with RSHL (reverse slope hearing loss) about six years ago. My ENT identified a genetic factor as the main cause, and I got fitted with hearing aids right away. They've made a huge difference in my daily life, honestly, I can't imagine getting by without them.

I just had my yearly checkup today, and when we compared my recent audiogram to the one from four years ago, it showed a 15 dB drop in both ears. That was a bit unsettling to see. 

I'm wondering if anyone here has RSHL or a similar type of progressive genetic hearing loss. Have you noticed your hearing changing significantly over time? Is gradual decline something that tends to happen with this type of loss, or can it sometimes stabilise?

I know everyone's hearing journey is different, but I'd really appreciate hearing about your experiences. It's been on my mind a lot today, especially thinking of what things might look like in 15 years down the line if the rate of decline stays the same. 

Thanks for taking the time to read!!

I’m hoping to learn from real experiences, not to design *for* anyone, but to better understand what helps parents and kids connect and what makes that process harder. I know it’s a deeply personal topic, and I want to approach it with care and respect.

I don’t really see where the design come in, since connection is about the human to human communication.

I know it’s uncomfortable to do, but asking the speaker to use a microphone and use it correctly is valid. It’s will probably help others who are having a hard time hearing too.

1o4qt3o,hardofhearing,I am a HOH teacher - are there any support groups for HOH/deaf educators?,"I am a first year educator with a hearing disability. I teach hearing students. I am having trouble policing talking as I can struggle to hear what exactly was said, who said it, and where the voice was coming from. I have talked to students about it. I am not seeing the changes I hoped for. Does anyone know of groups for teachers with disabilities that I could maybe join for support? A quick internet search has let me down - I don't seem to be able to find anything.

  


[댓글]
I don't know of any groups for HOH teachers, but I will share my experiences in the classroom as a HOH teacher. This seems more like a classroom management problem more than a HOH problem. The better your classroom management is, the less ""talking"" you are going to have to contend with. This isn't to say that ***you*** are doing things the wrong way, just that there are small changes that you can make to lessen the talking going on in your classroom.

* Set the expectations by enforcing noise levels. In my school we use the 3-0 scale. 3 is recess/assembly level, 2 is general talking/hallway levels, 1 is whisper (can only be heard by the person next to you), and 0 is no talking/noise at all. When we are in the classroom, the expectation is that noise levels do not raise above 1. Holding up a 0 or 1 is the signal for students to mirror your gesture and bring it down to that level. Hold up the 0 or 1 until all students have theirs raised.
* Use prompts like ""If you can hear the sound of my voice, clap once/clap twice"" at a low level and increase claps until the room is silent, or hold up your hand and count down from 5. At 1 the class should be silent. These work well with Proximity or the use of a microphone. Walk around the room so you know students can hear you in all parts of the room without the need to raise your voice.
* Reiterate these expectations every time you use these prompts, and be consistent. These are strategies that work at all grade levels. Also reiterate the expectation when you release students for individual or group work. ""We will be working in groups/individually. The expectation during this time is that the noise level will remain at a 1/0.""
* Proximity is a great way to get students to focus. If students are being too loud, go stand next to/over them. They quiet down pretty quickly when they have their teacher standing within inches of them. However if you are sitting at your desk or helping a student across the classroom, they are more likely to be talking loudly or goofing off.
* Use a microphone in the classroom hooked up to the classroom speakers or a bluetooth speaker while you are giving instruction. While it won't directly stop the talking going on during the lesson/lecture portion of your instruction, it will lessen it because now they are contending with the volume of your voice drowning out their own whispering.
* Keep students busy. If they are talking, this means they either don't have any work (they finished early), or the work they do have isn't mentally stimulating them enough to where they have to focus to complete the assignment. Additionally, set a time limit (with visual timers) for work you assign that is tight enough that students who aren't focusing will not be able to complete it in time.

I wish I could join a support club with you. I have exactly the same classroom management struggles.

i work in a deaf school so im not sure, but maybe assign a classroom job of “noise monitor”?

I’m a deaf (but use ha) teacher of high school age hearing students. A decade in, I’m over trying to police what they say. If they can say it where I don’t hear them then  it’s not my problem. They know I’m deaf and if they need me I have to see them and see their mouths. They learn quickly how to interact with me

I am a Deaf educator. I have a hearing TA but. I work in a school for the Deaf. My students are very helpful for figuring who or where noises came from if they saw or heard it too. 

I am sure there are a couple of others on here and r/deaf. Maybe I could create a facebook group.

I would love to join a group. I find this a struggle and I have a co-teacher who is hearing. It’s frustrating because I can’t hear them and I feel like they think I’m ignoring the students when we should be completely silent.

I used to teach High School to hearing students. It was a chore to police the use of cell phones since I am high frequency deaf. The students cought on that I did not hear the rings. Ugh. I just couldn't and ended up quitting. I hope it gets better and easier for you.

I am HoH and teach hearing University students. When they gave me a teaching role I was very clear that the struggle would be real, and they assured me I would be fine and then I wasn't. And on top of it I lost even more hearing towards the end of my first semester of teaching. Our disability services team couldn't link me up with any other HoH educators. The University has now put supports in place for me, like giving me much more lead in time to prepare, and becoming ok with me taking all of my tech everywhere.

I love your idea. Please set up a group.",2025-10-12 14:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o4qt3o/i_am_a_hoh_teacher_are_there_any_support_groups/
1o47dz3,hardofhearing,reverse slope (low frequency loss) and hearing aids,"hi all. looking to get hearing aids after 10+ years of not having them. 

my issues in the past were that the background noise would be amplified, and mask any high frequency speech sounds that i could already hear making it harder to hear with the hearing aids on. 

i was curious how tech has changed in the last 10 years. are hearing aids beneficial to you?

[댓글]
Been wearing hearing aids since I was a toddler. Audiologists have this mindset of only following your audiogram, but you have the right to tell them that it’s not your preference and you need the sound brought forward or the speech levels need to be amplified, whatever. 

Trust me. I have had multiple confrontations with audiologists over the years over this. They need reminding that YOU are the user and what you need goes. Don’t be afraid to push back as hard as you need to. 

Other than that, I’ve been told hearing aid tech has improved immensely but I’m not sure how, other than we have bluetooth and rechargeable battery capabilities now. The downside is the programming tracks the frequency and length of the wearing period which gets me scolded because I never wear them alone, which is 99% of the time.

Anyway, find your IDGAF energy and an audiologist you like and get fitted. Lol. Happy wearing! :)

I had reverse slope hearing loss, though it's leveled off and is pretty flat these days, so take it with a grain of salt. That said, couple things:

1. It took time for my ears to adjust to the new sounds. Keyboard presses sounded like gunshots, the air conditioner was deafening. I got used to it only after wearing my HAs all day for several weeks straight - your brain has to adapt.
2. It took several rounds of programming to dial in the right settings. I visited my audiologist monthly or even twice a month for the first 6 months or so, then every three months after that for a couple years. It's amazing how much of a difference tuning makes.",2025-10-11 21:30:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o47dz3/reverse_slope_low_frequency_loss_and_hearing_aids/

If you’re willing, please message me privately — it’ll only take about 2–3 minutes, and your input would be incredibly helpful. All questions are respectful and purely for academic purposes.

Thanks so much in advance for your time and perspective!

Deaf people are already less likely to get into an auto crash. Maybe you could look o to accessibility devices to help hearing people drive better.

You don’t really need hearing to drive. In fact, one of the biggest prejudices there are about the Deaf community is that we can’t drive. I have personally participated in research that showed that we HoH and Deaf drive **more** safely than average, because of paying visual attention to the traffic better, for example a more consistent and appropriate use of rear mirrors, and so on. Your project therefore doesn’t really solve a problem, but rather contributes to cementing misconceptions.

Note, we don’t really need to communicate using speech when driving, we don’t need to hear what people say and we aren’t socially excluded when driving.

I’d recommend doing much more research before starting a project.

I went to the other post on the other thread that you shared and some of the comments were fantastic, advising you to find a lawyer and explaining step by step how much of an ADA violation this is as well as workplace retaliation and discrimination. Those are awesome. 

As a hard of hearing person, I am curious if they have provided any kind of accommodations in your classroom that may help? I am thinking... mirrors above the board and on the side of the board so you can see if a student is raising their hand when you're writing something. 

A strict policy of hand raising since you cannot follow random comments. 

I'm wondering if you would be allowed to have your phone on you and do speech to text when an incident is happening so you can have a transcript of what is said? Obviously, you will not be able to stare at your phone to keep up during the incident, but It can help when filing an incident report.   
  
I'm trying to think creatively. Obviously you won't get any fancy accommodations from admin who don't understand the nature of hearing loss. I'm just honestly stunned that a SCHOOL wouldn't provide... accommodations even for a teacher. That's wild to me. Do they have a disability services office? That's my own curious question.

We communicate through writing but it has become clear they need some assistance (they came to ask me to call the electrician yesterday and it turns out they haven’t had AC since June. They have adult children nearby so I didn’t think to check on them. I grabbed some extension cords and the electricians helped me set up some lights and fans for them. It gets very hot in the summer and I even have a portable AC they could have used.

They don’t even have cell phones. They do have some sort of laptop-based app. I have multiple old smartphones that I can set them up with that would work with their current wireless and for $15 we could add cellular. I see some promising apps but this seems like something I should get expert advice on. What tools have you found useful and, assuming they’re interested, what is the best way to help someone learn? I am open to paying a pro for a session or two if that would be best.  Many thanks in advance. They’re very sweet people and I’d like for them to at least be able to communicate with me in an emergency.

Check with your states agency for deaf and hard of hearing for a caption device or phone. 

Check with your fire department for smoke alarms that flash a light.

Reading a message can be challenging too, depending on their ability to process/ read quickly. Some apps retain the written msg for review. Im using CaptionCall for calls, and a transcription app for irt meetings.

Caption Call is free

Innocaption is free for deaf/ hoh 
I think you might have to enter your  SSN to register. I forgot.  Its decent sometimes hit or miss

For face to face conversations in quiet environments, the captions built into any phones accessibility menu should be good enough. Paid services like otter.ai are more accurate. 

Is this a situation where they just need a little help or do they need adult care services? In the US, they can use IP relays, VRS (if they sign), or InnoCaption free of charge to make phone calls. Having adult children in the area does not mean they are capable of living on their own.

Android or IoS?

Android use live transcribe. I have an app that's basically an improved version of that hopefully in a few days or whenever the play store approves it, too.

1o0xjgf,hardofhearing,Hearing Aids Best for Heavy Sweating?,"I am going in for a hearing aid fitting/evaluation in a couple weeks to get a new pair. I had the fancy starkeys with all the Bluetooth this and this that for about 5 years and I HATE THEM. 

This time around I want some that are absolutely NOT Bluetooth capable and do not have *any* phone connectivity and are made for people who work outside and sweat, etc a LOT.

Are there any particular ones I should be looking at and thinking about? 

[댓글]
Talk to your audiologist about that. And for hearing aids to not be connected is totally fine. your audiologist will knkw how to help for both of those concerns. Fyi

You don't need to use the Bluetooth feature. Definitely not ReSound. Phonak managed sweat better.

Some of them are waterproof, or at least rated water resistant.

When I was a kid I think sweat did in one of my BTE aids.  More recently, my old Phonak would sometimes shut off when I got very sweaty but they'd turn back on when they dried out.

My current ones (Oticon) seem completely resistant to it.  I work a job where I'm sometimes very sweaty and they're basically sitting in pools of salt water for hours behind my ears and they're fine.  I wear them at the gym, too.

I used to worry about it but I decided to just not worry about it.  They're under a fairly comprehensive warranty.

Absolutely no phone connectivity may be a tough ask.  Almost all hearing aids have a T-coil receiver even if they don't have Bluetooth.  And almost all have Bluetooth, too, these days.

This is one of the reasons I went with in the ear. They are naturally protected from sweat and don't bounce around when I'm working out. Not an option for everyone, but I greatly prefer them.

My audiologist actually said Bluetooth options tend to be more waterproof because they don’t have any access points to the battery like the ones with a physical battery do.

Ooooh so you’re switching to rechargeable?

I switched from Signia to Phonak, and I LOVE them. Withstand heavy workouts much better than Signia. You will still have to give them maintenance though and more often because of the sweat. There's truly no brands out there that are sweat proof.",2025-10-08 01:33:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0xjgf/hearing_aids_best_for_heavy_sweating/
1o0weh8,hardofhearing,Tympanoplasty recovery question,"I had a tympanoplasty almost 4 months ago, but I’m still struggling with my hearing in that ear and wanted to see if anybody else has a similar experience.

He said it could take 12 weeks from the surgery date for my hearing to be normal, but I’m at about 15 weeks now and I’m still hearing a lot of internal noise when I open/close my jaw. My voice also sounds really loud in that ear when I talk. I have a hearing test scheduled in a few weeks, but I’m starting to panic since I haven’t noticed any improvement in the last month.

1o0s3dc,hardofhearing,New Signia hearing aids making me crazy! 😵‍💫,"I just got hearing aids for the first time. The left one, that is. I’ve always semi joked that my left ear canal was deformed because I could never get regular in-ear speakers (can’t remember actual name) to fit.

This left one will not seat properly. We’ve tried a large dome, a smaller dome, and the one you see in the picture. It’s always loosening in my ear canal, especially when I’m eating. It’s making me just crazy!!! The right ear is seated just right and doesn’t loosen at all. I need to go back to the hearing center. But first, what are your thoughts?

[댓글]
My ears are so tiny internally that they used the kids dome from a different set. Look into it!

Why not get the custom earmolds? They'll be exact to your ear canal that way

I got custom made molds. I could not stand the domes. My hearing aids are receiver in the ear too.

Maybe you and your audiologist can look into Grip Tips? I know Oticon makes a few sizes and maybe they would fit on your Signia hearing aids? I was having so many fit issues this year with my new hearing aids and this is what I landed on. They’re kind of an in-between of domes and custom ear molds. They’re almost sticky feeling and as they warm up in your ear they really grip on and don’t move around like domes do.

Molds are the way to go, as long as it's an option with that style receiver. I had a trial pair one time with domes, they would pull off the receiver and get stuck in my ear all the time. I would use this tiny pair of eyeglasses tweezers to fish them out of my ears.

I’m somewhat like that with my right. It won’t seal. I have tiny ear canals and get wax plugs easily

Audiologist here. If you were my patient I'd add a retention tail. When my patients are between sizes I go with the larger size and cut 1 or 2 slits in it to make it ""tulip"" and then you've made a dome that's between sizes. If none of that worked, we'd be talking about custom molds.

Depending on your insurance custom ear molds might be the answer for you. My ears are tiny as well and the only thing that worked for me are custom ear molds. The feedback went away when I got them.

For years my domes slipped out and I didn’t know any better.  I was told there was one size larger they could use.  When it first went inside t was a bit uncomfortable and took me about a week to get used to it.  But I now don’t have them coming out anymore.  Maybe if the kid ones don’t help you you could try this.

I suggest custom earmolds. Because they'll be custom-made to your ear, you won't have any problems.",2025-10-07 21:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0s3dc/new_signia_hearing_aids_making_me_crazy/
1o0loz4,hardofhearing,Lipreading and Auditory Training,"In 1950s, more rehabilitation was offered for hearing loss through the VA. It not only included hearing aids but auditory training and lipreading practices. In the 70s, that fell by the wayside and the focus became more about hearing technology. By the 90s, lipreading just about disappeared.

I've had hearing loss since the mid 80s and got my first pair of hearing aids in the early 90s. Back then, it was analog hearing aids and boy did I struggle with them. What I didn't know at the time was that hearing aids didn't fix my kind of hearing loss. I also didn't know about hearing aid limits back then so background noise continued to be a huge problem in my work environment. I had coworkers say things like, ""Are your ears on,"" when I couldn't understand them. Or the hated, ""Turn up your hearing aids!"" During those years, I thought something was wrong with me. 

Hearing aid limits: They work best within 6 feet. Even though they are better than ever (I love my digital hearing aids over those old analogs), it still interferers. Harsh acoustics with reverberation also impact the usefulness of hearing aids. I didn't learn that until after 17 years of hearing aid use. If I had known, I could created workarounds way back in the 90s. 

After a big drop in hearing going into the severe range (high frequency hearing loss), I had to learn to communicate all over again. I also lost my career at this point because I couldn't cope in noisy environments and there weren't as many accommodations as there are today.  

After two years of feeling like I was in a hole, I did climb out with persistence and determination. I started to teach lipreading for the D/HH state agency, among other hearing loss related classes. I found lipreading to be most helpful because it taught me how to advocate for myself and evaluate communication situations. Now I teach for [Hearing Loss LIVE!](https://hearinglosslive.com/lipreading-classes/) and I have a class this Saturday for the strategies that go with lipreading. Strategies are must because 60 to 70 percent of speech is NOT visible. We need workarounds. Lip shapes are only one of the tools of lipreading and I can teach the visible shapes too, with a class on Oct 25th.

Lipreading aside, auditory training is important too. Over two years ago, I got my first Bluetooth hearing aids. Wow! After not listening to audio books most of my life, I dipped my toe in with these hearing aids in. At first I kept the [built-in smartphone captions](https://hearinglosslive.com/smartphone-built-in-accessibility-for-hearing-loss/) on to help me with the listening. After enough practice, I was able to let go of the captions. The trick was using my hearing aid app to slide out ambient/environmental noise.  I miss words from time to time but I can usually puzzle it out at some point. After a few years of this, I realized auditory training has improved my comprehension. So there really is something to the full rehabilitation the VA offered many years ago. I highly encourage this practice now with podcasts and audiobooks if you don't already do this. Just make sure the narrators/speakers don't have an accent, they talk one at a time, have a steady pace and no background noise. I'm choosy what I listen to and it helps. 

We don't hear things like this from most hearing professionals. It comes from hardcore personal experience.  Thought I'd share a couple of tips to help. Also, use the [Three Golden Rules](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/) with everyone. That alone helped me a lot year ago when I discovered that made all the difference for me. 



[댓글]
Great points.  I have been avoiding audiobooks but I can see the benefits uf using them.

There is no scientific proof that auditory training helps. Getting use to a CInis a different thing, with hearing aids you simply lack the input.

Lip reading might be ok for emergencies, when other options aren’t available, but I feel you should be advocating for skills that do offer us 100% of what’s said without effort, instead of 30% with a great cognitive effort. Why should we waste our cognition on just listening, instead of using it to actually process the information itself. CART, captioning and sign language provide so much more efficient access to speech, and we deserve it.",2025-10-07 17:43:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0loz4/lipreading_and_auditory_training/

Do you notice the same or it's because I got my diag quite early? Here is things I notice in their behavior.

\-They often ask me to repeat.

\-They ""stare me"" like it's being more confortable to hear me due to lip reading (without noticing?)

\-They also speak louder than other people, and when we watch tv, often ask me to higher the sound.

Do you notice this behavior on other people and if so do you speak about hearing loss? A friend of mine decided to test themself to see if their hearing is right.

I feel like before this I did not notice this behavior because I was quite on denial.

Yeah all the time. HoH people often show the same masking techniques. Iykyk

Aye, it's pretty noticable.

I got a lovely new boss a few years ago and I realised she was deaf by the end of her first week, whereas some of our team still have no idea. She couldn't hear anything going on behind her which is the biggest giveaway for me :D We're a good combo. My desk faces into the room so I alert her when someone wants her and in return, she handles accents for me lmao.

I also seem to be able to identify hearing aids at fifty paces. Even just walking down the street, I'll notice if someone walking past has got a hearing aid. I love seeing them! I was the only deaf kid at school and the only deaf adult I knew was my grandad. Now I go to work and there are deaf students and other deaf staff and I don't feel alone any more.

I’ve suspected I may have less than great hearing, because if someone isn’t looking at me I struggle to make out what they are saying, and noticed I didn’t hear as well during covid when people were wearing masks. I also ask people to repeat things, and then smile and nod if I feel like I’ve asked too many times.

Yes, especially if they're a lipreader. I've also noticed the other signs you mentioned.

Same here. They say hearing loss is invisible but to those in the know, we know. I instantly recognize it as I talk to people too.

What does masking mean?

Yeah, I do. I've been wearing mine for 7 years, and somehow found more people with mild hearing loss, thanks to mine.

I've telling my neighbor that her child is HoH for several years. She honestly gets offended.

About three months ago they went to an ENT and audiologist.

He has hearing loss and a speech therapist now. 🥲

Also, I have an employee who I've worked with off and on for over a decade.

About a month ago she found out I was HoH for the first time in a hilarious exchange where she realized how many times she's heard me say ""I can't hear you"". 😆",2025-10-07 14:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0guay/do_you_notice_as_well_people_being_hard_of_hearing/

1o05eun,hardofhearing,how to explain my hearing to friends/classmates,"Some context to begin with, i struggle with low frequencies rather than high ones, and im on a months long wait list to see an audiologist to figure out how much hearing i have and what type of loss. My GP agrees that i have some level of loss, and that hearing aids may be helpful for me, but i dont know how bad my hearing is nor have access to aids yet. I struggle with conversations even in quiet environments unless the other person is louder, next to me, and facing me, and it has to be just the one person so i can focus on them. I only hear the higher pitched sounds of rain, and even at its heaviest rain is quiet for me. I can only really hear things comfortably when its loud, singular things to focus on, and in a quiet environment.   
I'm not even sure if its a loss at all, as my hearing has always been this way since i was  little, im now 20, but as i was neglected i never saw a doctor from what im aware of. My parents often complained about my ""selective"" hearing, and i have never really been much of an out loud talker from what i now know was social fatigue from being autistic, and listening fatigue making conversations especially difficult and taxing. I also struggle to speak in general as i trip over words, and according to my flatmate i apparently have a lisp and audibly struggle to say letters that i coincidentally also struggle to hear. I was put into a BSL club when i was a kid so i can do basic signs and fingerspelling, but we're not really sure if i was there just because it was available or if i was having visible issues or delays.  
  
I'm now finally in a college course and in a place where i have the energy for it, but im really struggling with communicating with my friends and classmates out loud. Its an art course and the majority of us are autistic/adhd, so when i explain that i cant hear very well or am hard of hearing they tend to go ""oh me too! i struggle to process words, i always go what? whenever someone is repeating what theyve said for me!"". And i get it i really do, but they arent seeming to understand that its not what i mean. And ive already noticed people looking at me funny as i assume ive missed them talking to me, or completely ignored them because ive had to focus on the lecturer speaking. So saying im hard of hearing just isnt explaining enough anymore, but i dont want to have to completely explain my experience just so people finally start speaking up to me. I've thought about saying im d/Deaf, as it has been since i was a child and i would rather use BSL if i had people that knew it, but as we dont know my level of loss yet im not sure im comfortable or right in doing so.   


It's a tough situation for me rn, but i have these classmates for at least this school year and the next, and I may not be seen by audiology until February. I'm also not sure if hearing aids would even be useful if they are offered as i expect i will be very overwhelmed with sound.

[댓글]
Say you're hard of hearing but unfortunately don't have your hearing aids yet, and ask them to speak up/speak to you from the front/whatever helps. Mentioning the aids should make clear that it is indeed a physical problem without you having to explain your whole life?

I do that when I'm too lazy to put mine in (I say I forgot lol) because I didn't expect to talk to people XD

PS: if you have good care they will gradually, and with you in team, adjust the aids so you aren't swamped with sound right away. Well worth it :)

I also struggle with low frequencies, but I didn't lose my hearing until last year. It's been a huge adjustment. I just got my hearing aids in May, but I couldn't hear in September, and now I'm in a PhD program. I'm just super honest with people. 


I worried about people not understanding when I said hard of hearing so I would say, ""hey sorry I'm deaf, I didn't catch that. Can you face me?"" Etc. 


Even if I've told people before and they forget, I just try to remind them and keep it lighthearted. I'm in a lab with loud machines, so I just blame them. I always go. ""Sorry, whenever the centrifuge is running all my hearing aids pick up is the machine, can you repeat that?"" 


Everyone I mention it to it super supportive and understanding. People don't mean to be rude, they just genuinely forget a lot. Especially if you're good at keeping up by lip-reading/hearing aids most of the time.

So I’ve been hard of hearing my whole life. I learned to mask so well in social situations even when I miss parts of conversations.  The best thing to do is be honest and say that you didn’t hear something and ask them to please speak up or face you as they are talking. And I agree with mentioning that you’re in the process of getting aids and you have a really hard time hearing without them. Also since you’re in college have you looked into getting accommodations to help? When you go to the audiologist definitely mention it. They can give you a microphone that the professor wears and it amplifies their voice and helps you not strain your ears so much trying to listen to what they are saying.

1nzooce,hardofhearing,Anniversary of my Hearing Aid (humor),"Feeling a bit sentimental - I've officially had a hearing aid for a year to help my moderate low frequency hearing loss. It's been quite a year of learning, being a better advocate for myself, and navigating the grief.

I'm a young woman working in engineering, with many, many soft-spoken men. Probably one of the worst combinations with my particular flavor of loss (fortunately the hearing aid helps tremendously). Part of the learning and advocacy has been figuring out where the silver linings and humor lie.

So please enjoy my lifelong friend's immediate reaction to learning about my loss - I still pull up this screenshot on the dark days.

1nzdusd,hardofhearing,BAHA issue,"Good morning everyone. Just looking to get some advice and see if anyone has had a similar issue. 

I’m 31 and a few years ago had to have a mastoidectomy on both sides to resolve an issue. As a result the hearing loss in both ears was significantly reduced. As of August this year I recently had BAHA surgery. Currently waiting for my switch on to get the hearing aids attached. 

The issue I’m having is that the left bolt has completely slipped out leaving a small hole in my head. I went to A&amp;E over the weekend, got seen by an ENT doctor who has advised that I call my audiologist department that fitted my implants. I’m currently waiting on a call back. 

I’m just curious has anyone that has had a BAHA had the bolt slip out before? I’ve followed all instructions. Don’t touch it etc so I’m quite baffled at how it has just quite literally slipped out. My panic is that this will happen again. 

Any advice would be most kindly appreciated and hope you all have a great day! 

[댓글]
Yeah it happened before to me. I remember the doctor saying to me that I can’t be hit on the head or else the abutment would get loose and fall out. I eventually got hit once on the head so I had to go get the surgery again a couple months later.",2025-10-06 08:52:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nzdusd/baha_issue/

But I realized that its not good for ears, am I now doomed for doing it for 6 months? I am 31 and I fear I will deaf soon. Please help. I will not be doing any clubbing anymore is what I have vowed to myself. I hope that all the damage that I did to my ears in the last 6 months will get recovered in due time as I stop exposure to loud music. I have so far been to clubs for 25 times this year for an average 3.5 hours per session. The music I would say was loud for hald of that time. The res of the time it stays quite medium.  

[댓글]
I think it’s a little more complicated than that so the short answer is no.

If you lose hearing I highly doubt the club would be the sole issue. Both of my siblings went to the club once a week for years and neither has a hearing issue. If you’d like to keep going clubbing and reduce the potential for hearing loss caused my loud noise use earplugs.

I think if 3 hours of loud music 1-4 times a month guaranteed deafness, there would be a lot more deaf people in the world. You’re fine. Wear some earplugs when you’re at the club to protect yourself and ease up that anxiety.

you should be fine. it takes years of exposure so if your going deaf its certainly not that alone if that at all. it would be more like daily for 6 months to make any sense. but use noise reduction earplugs made for concerts going forward to reduce risk and youll be fine.",2025-10-05 20:32:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nyz8qp/am_i_certain_to_be_deaf_now/

I’m experiencing extreme swelling in and around the right side of my face, ear itself, neck, and behind the ear. I called the doctors to make sure this was normal and they said yes. 

The pain isn’t so bad but how do you people sleep?!!!?!? I cannot sleep. My back is aching from being propped up all night. Last night, I tried to sleep propped up, laying on my good ear side, but I still was waking up all throughout the night. 

Do yall have any tips or tricks? Any special pillow I can get or something?? I’ve been sleeping with that bowl that they give you the first day because I’m scared to roll over on my ear. I’m desperate and will buy anything because I’m not sure that my healing is going to be done in a week like they advised. TYIA!!

I just had the same surgery 4 days ago and am feeling awful. I have my post op in 2 days. I also was under the same impression that I would be back to work within a week and the way I feel right now, I have no idea how that will be possible. The pain has been intense but now it’s just the pressure and fullness in my ear. It’s driving me insane. 
Can anyone relate?

Thank you! Just any words of hope helps! Has seemed so bleak for me the last few days.I definitely was not as prepared as much as I should have been with how difficult the recovery part would be. And yes I’ll look into the pillow! So glad you’re finally feeling relief! Quick question, at your first post op, did they remove any of the packing from your surgery?

1nxpese,hardofhearing,Saving ears at concerts,"Hi everybody,

I was wondering how you all are saving your ears at concerts? I normally take out my hearing aid (I only have one) and wear classic earplugs by the German brand Ohropax. I was wondering if anybody has experiences with loop switch? 

[댓글]
Hearing aids out.
Loop Experience in. 

Tried a few different earplugs over the years, Loop have been the best for my ears, both for protection and for sound clarity.

My work gave me custom high end earplugs (they retail for about 1K CAD - I work in a very noisy environment), so I'd  bring those. They have a perfect  fit for my ears and bring all noise down to about 70dB without  distorting the sound quality.  I am really sensitive to loud noises after my work accident that caused my hearing loss, so before I got these earplugs at my new place of work, I actually didn't like live music anymore because  why would  I pay money to be in pain for hours?

I'm also attending a concert soon and debating whether to use my hearing aids or just use my loop earplugs. 

I wanted to try wearing hearing aids in a concert to maybe hear some notes I couldn't hear before, especially since there's a live band. But, from the comments, I think I'll just keep my earplugs in.",2025-10-04 09:24:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nxpese/saving_ears_at_concerts/
1nxky3s,hardofhearing,Single-Side Deafness- New to wearing hearing aid: ear molds vs domes?,"I was recently diagnosed with single-sided deafness and was fitted with a hearing aid. However, my device came with a dome instead of an ear mold. I brought this up with my doctor, who provided several different dome sizes, but all of them cause discomfort and pain in my inner ear.

My question is: should I consider switching to custom ear molds? If so, how would I go about getting them through insurance? Alternatively, are there any over-the-counter or specialized products (something I can order on Amazon, Etsy) that could help address the discomfort I’m experiencing with the domes?

[댓글]
I had single sided deafness for about a decade (and then started losing hearing in my good ear) but I used domes. The mold closed off to much of my natural hearing. But honestly it depends on the type of hearing loss you have. You can also try and see what works best. It's not hard for you audiologist to change them.

I have moderate loss in both ears as well as auditory processing disorder. I’m also autistic so have sensory issues. I didn’t get on with domes. I’ve had a few sets of molds, ranging from hard acrylic to soft silicone. I’m currently wearing soft acrylic as I found the hard ones felt too loose and the silicone ones made my ears sweaty and itchy. I’m in the UK so don’t have the same insurance limitations. I too have looked for over the counter solutions, without success. Good luck!

I've used silicone and acrylic moulds, and power domes.  The domes were the least comfortable.  I only used them while the moulds were being made.  By the end of the day my poor ear canal would just be aching from where it pressed in several spots.  

Where I live molds are usually sold with the hearing aid as part of a package deal through the audiologist but it sounds like hearing aids are provisioned differently where you live.  (Through a doctor?)

My ears won't are meant for those dome. So I have to go to audiologist to get the ear molds done.

I’ve have single sided deafness for 22 years now and have always have had molds! I don’t think I’ll ever use domes- just not for me, and that’s ok! I think it’s worth talking to your audiologist and advocate for the molds if the domes haven’t felt comfortable.",2025-10-04 04:50:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nxky3s/singleside_deafness_new_to_wearing_hearing_aid/

That reminds me of the Babblefish from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Overall your idea and concept sound interesting.

Depending on your plot and world building, think about what getting used to having a dragonsnail in your ears be like. Is that something youd like to explore? Is being hard of hearing something you'd like to address plot wise? Is it considered a disability in the world? or how does each tribe and nation views your character due to his hearing loss? What kind of limitations does having dragonsnail aids and what positive attributes does it provide your character?

There's so much you can come up with and so much to think about, but it all depends on what story you're trying to tell.

I do like how it looks but I think I’d rather see something that looks more realistic. Or if a younger kid was reading it they might get excited to see something they’re wearing too. 

Either way works though! We need more representation.

Hiya - hearing aids shouldn’t cover up the whole ear. 

It’s not like a headphone for listening to music. 

Every person experiences hearing loss differently- their ear has very specific abilities to “funnel” the sound into your head. 

Try having your shell design off the ear - check out Cocher Implants.

I love the whole idea. Everything of it. And exactly as it is. Don’t change anything. I think real world issues with real hearing aids just do not apply in this context. Just point out the positive. I‘m pretty sure both Deaf and hearing kids will love the idea.

The only thing I would ask myself: If it is symbiotic, what do the snails get out of it? But you‘re a writer, so you‘ll figure it out. The reason could just lie in the past or is a reward for being a true dragon friend or that dragon snails just need trust, closeness, warmth and words to live. And they could go on a „walk“ and grass a bit nearby, when they feel the hero has fallen asleep (my first words in the morning would probably be: „Where are my snails???“ 😀).

By the way, I don‘t know if you are familiar with the process of being fitted with hearing aids. But when you get ear moulds (the part that sits in the ear), an impression is taken by squeezing a goo-ish (silicon-like) mass into your ear canal, which then expands and fills every corner of your ear canal. It feels exactly like a snail crawling into your ear (at least I guess that‘s what it would feel like).

Good luck with the story!

Greetings from Hamburg

If you need any assistance with describing how it may feel having that parasite in an ear, the Animorphs series from the 90s has a lot of descriptions because the antagonists are slug aliens that live in your ear/brain. 

I'd definitely consider what type of loss he has as that would help describe the functionality of the ""aids"" so to speak.

I dont have anything to add that wasnt already said above, but id just like to say i love this idea! Im both hard of hearing and an artist/designer, and this scratches such an itch for representation in media! Its inspiring me to wanna create my own hoh character &lt;33

1nxagy0,hardofhearing,I think I have hearing loss and I don't know who to ask (?,"the context:

about a month ago I bought a pair of Focal Bathys and I've started to notice something weird. Voices always sound louder/clearer on the right side, and I don't really hear them centered in my head. It feels like they're shifted to the right. On top of that, sometimes I get this kind of ""empty"" sensation in my left ear, almost like something's blocking it a bit.

I thought it might be the headphones, but when I flipped them around (right cup on left ear and vice versa), the voices actually sounded perfectly centered again.

so could this actually be hearing loss in my left ear? I notice the same thing when listening to voice messages too weird thing is, with in-ear headphones I don't really have this issue, maybe because they go directly into the ear, idk.

Also, in the channel balance I now have it slightly further to the left so I can hear the singer's voice centered in my head.

Can anyone suggest something to me? I doubt a Focal Bathys would come damaged lol

An audiologist assess hearing that’s who you have to ask.

Just go to an audiologist. I have progressive hearing loss and I am now a bit hyper vigilant about losing hearing. Differences when listening to music has always been a big indicator for me. The audiology test is usually around $100-150.

Hear in Canada, audiologists that sell HAs usually offer a free hearing test to bring people into the office.  Check to see if they do that where you live.  Most here also let you try out new ones risk free for a while, you can return them without an obligation.",2025-10-03 20:37:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nxagy0/i_think_i_have_hearing_loss_and_i_dont_know_who/
1nwalxg,hardofhearing,Dealing with fluctuating hearing loss,"So I, 20F, have been dealing with fluctuating hearing loss for around a year. For some backstory, I have an autoimmune disease that can lead to fluctuating hearing loss that flares up relatively frequently as well as autism with an auditory processing disorder. 

I have had 3 audiograms all with different results. One was at the end of a flare and showed conductive hearing loss, the 2nd was in the middle of one and showed mixed hearing loss so I got hearing aids, and the 3rd was between flares when I felt pretty good and it was normal. My audiologist told me to keep using my hearing aids when I need them but for some reason, I feel like a scam artist or something. Maybe it’s years of medical trauma but I feel like I’m making up my own hearing loss and don’t know if I can truly claim it or not.

Sometimes I can hear practically everything and other days I mostly just hear my own tinnitus. I’ve been struggling to figure out if I should learn ASL or just keep trudging through and hope my hearing doesn’t get worse. I’m also afraid that if I did learn ASL, I wouldn’t really need it? Even though I do struggle to hold conversation half the time.

Everything feels rather stressful when it comes to my hearing and I wish I felt like I had community where I am but I don’t.

“I’ve been struggling to figure out if I should learn asl or keep trudging through and hope my hearing doesn’t get worse” you originally said you have fluctuating hearing loss which means it’s going to get worse.

In your place I’d learn ASL as a “just in case”. You never know if your autoimmune disease will permanently effect your hearing one day so it makes sense to be ready",2025-10-02 17:44:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nwalxg/dealing_with_fluctuating_hearing_loss/

Check in to the lions club foundation, starkey hearing foundation and Google search your state hearing aid grant programs.

Can also search device reutilization programs in your state. They tend to lean towards things like walkers and wheelchairs but if they don’t have hearing aids can possibly point you towards who might.

You should google organisations in your area that may be able to help

I hope you find a program to help you.  They certainly are expensive.  A slightly more affordable option may be going through Costco.  I paid about $1600 a year ago for the set.  I have moderate to severe hearing loss.  I know that’s still a lot of money but it may be more affordable than some other places.

Someone has already mentioned the Lions Club, but I want to second that. My friend donated her mom's hearing aids to them. 

Of course it's completely fucked up that Medicare won't cover hearing aids, as they are not a luxury item.

My mother got hearing aids from Costco for $1,500.

not sure about how to get hearing aids, but there are other free ways to help, such as signing! sometimes accommodating is cheaper than “fixing”

Look up the disability services in your state ( assuming you live in USA) 

They are often referred as voc rehab or disability services .. each state has it called something else. You can also contact the deaf schools to see if they have any resources that she could look into...


 If she qualifies they the state will pay if not she is back at square one.

Many HA businesses where I live donate older HAs to charities/organizations that redistribute them to people in need.   Check with local audiologists to see where they donate them to, and then contact those charities. 

Good luck.

You might want to look into OTC hearing aids. Some actually work fine for moderate loss. My mom uses a pair from audien hearing and they work perfectly well. They have FDA-registered models starting at around $200. Pretty basic but way better than nothing.",2025-09-30 17:01:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nuiqod/please_advise/

Just insert whatever real life details make sense for you in the brackets. 
Remember that tone and facial expression are gonna be really important with emotionally sensitive people. You got a emphasize that it US vs THE PROBLEM. Not you vs your kid.

Don't be defensive. Just let him talk. And keep in mind he is getting closer to puberty, so that is a lot of mental and emotional growth on his end along with the physical. He will be very tender and sensitive about everything.  

It's really important to give him the safe places where he can let out his hot air and know that yes the and you can't change the hearing loss but he knows and you know that within each other there is safety. And no defensiveness going on.

1ntyv8h,hardofhearing,audiogram advice for low frequency struggles,"Update: turns out the place i was going to get my hearing tested wont let me as im too young, apparently unless its age related it \*has\* to be investigated by the nhs first according to the email i got, which makes sense i would want a doctor to properly investigate instead of just prescribing aids, but i was always planning on getting the basic test done at this place while i wait for an nhs appointment. Unfortunately I may be waiting up to 18 weeks simply for the assessment, and i am seriously struggling in my college now

\----

So i finally got my hearing test booked for the end of this week, and i am so nervous  
my last one was back in march and it came back normal despite obvious struggles, and we've determined it was the audiologist that i saw not doing in depth enough testing and only looking for high frequency loss (which i think is fairly mild for me now but may have been normal at the time)  
i have since gotten worse, i think losing some high frequencies may have made the lost low ones way more obvious, and im seeing a different free provider while im waiting on a referral to the nhs services so it should hopefully go better  
i am going to make sure i mention this to them, but im also wondering if i can ask for a ""reset"" inbetween tones during the beep test, as after a couple tones my tinnitus ends up getting louder and louder until its louder than the test itself, i end up hearing phantom versions of the actual tones that ive already heard, and its very dizzying so i think i need many breaks where i hear something normal inbetween to get accurate results?  
i am very nervous that i wont see a good audiologist again that wont test for low tones, is there anything else i could say or do to potentially make this a little easier?

My test done by the nhs covered ranges from 250hz to 8khz. Your audiologist should ask if you have tinnitus before they start if they don’t then tell them.

1ntqi8i,hardofhearing,Anticipating Dinner Table Syndrome- Advice?,"For those unfamiliar- Dinner Table Syndrome is the experience of being left out (intentionally or unintentionally) of conversation because of hearing issues (and/or lack of access such as sign language use). Usually, at the dinner table, but I'm sure all of us have experienced it in many places. 

I'm going to a small event in a few hours, and already know this is going to be an issue. It's sounding like it'll be 10-ish people, and exactly 2 of them ever bother to include me in the conversation in any way. 

It's my brother-in-law's birthday dinner, at a restaurant I can't even eat at, and my husband and father-in-law are the ones who generally make an effort to include me. I'm only hoping I'll be able to sit near enough to FIL for that much to even be an option. 

Does anyone have any advice? I truly can't explain why I continue bothering to go to these things, but somehow I guess I've decided to go. Thanks in advance.

Tell your father in law ahead of time that you'd love to sit with him at dinner, save you a seat so you can catch up.

I suggest using the wireless microphone (tiny device, not the karaoke microphone lol)  that connects to your phone via Bluetooth. Use the caption app on your phone and the mic should be able to pick up the sounds and spell out words. I have an IPhone 16 and it comes with built in caption.

Oh this is probably the reason I end up drinking more than I should at these type of things !

When I’m in this situation, I do my best to follow the mannerisms of everyone else at the table (laughing when they laugh, for instance) and get real comfortable with the fact that I’ll have hardly a clue what the plot of the conversation is lol. 

It’s exhausting trying to make hearing people consider me and I’d rather occasionally feel left out than intentionally ignored.

I relate to this so hard. I have multiple food allergies, so I can't eat at many restaurants, so I go to hang out, but then I can't hear anyone. I'm not much help, but just know you aren't alone in this. Most of the time at restaurants I just sit there looking around or honestly, I sit next to the kids if there are any. They dont care as much if I need them to repeat themselves and I can just have silly little conversations with them so it doesnt mind if I miss something and sound a little goofy.

Bring pen and paper.

1ntkwma,hardofhearing,Jabra Disabled My Hearing Aids Remotely Without Warning,"I bought a pair of Jabra Enhance 500 hearing aids in late July for $2,100, financed through Bread Payments. Two weeks later, they went on sale for $300 off, and Jabra refunded me that amount after I asked. But then, without explanation, they refunded another $1,400. I kept making payments, never knowing the balance was lower.

A few weeks later, I got a call from someone at Jabra named Morgan, who said they’d accidentally refunded the full amount (they didn't) and I’d need to return the hearing aids. She promised a deep discount on a new pair, including the new 700 model, and said I’d receive the replacements *before* sending mine back. That never happened. I'm still making payments to Bread. Most recently, today.

Then, this past Friday at 5 PM, Jabra remotely disabled my hearing aids. No warning. They stopped pairing with the app, lost their programming, and I was left in silence. I had no idea remote deactivation was even possible. I’ve become really dependent on them, and losing access like that was jarring and isolating.

I called customer service this morning and was told it could take up to five business days for a manager to respond. Meanwhile, I’m stuck without hearing support because of a refund error I didn’t cause, and a promise that was never kept.

I’m sharing this because I think it’s important for others to know that remote disablement is a thing. These aren’t luxury items. They’re medical devices. If a company can cut off your access without notice, that’s a serious ethical issue.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I’d love to hear how you handled it or if you have advice on how to escalate it.

I'm very surprised about the since the FDA regulates medical devices to ensure safety and effectiveness. 

If Jabra did this, that would mean they did a post sale modification without a medical or safety justification and that is a very good way to get the FDA's attention.

Not only that, I can think of four different ways a lawyer would take on this, depending on the contract and finance agreements...

Breach of contract, breach of warranty, violation of customer protection statutes, tortious interference with property and even if the contracts do include clauses, I can see the courts taking a dim view on this.

but I'm layman and I'd double check with a qualified professional on that aspect.

Wow. That is some bullsh!t.

I believe GN Resound owns the Jabra brand. Let them know about this.

This is dystopian

Very black mirror like! How horrible, I still don't understand why they view hearing aids as cosmetic....like, I can't hear without them? 😢🫠

contact your state attorney general’s office.

So that's why hearing aids went digital, it wasn't because they are better, it was so they can control them from their computer.

I wonder whether there is any civil rights organisation that would be interested in taking this on as a case. Aside from the fact that it was their mistake not yours which caused this, it is absolutely disgusting that a company would just turn somebody's hearing aids off without knowing what is going on in their life. You could be having a medical emergency, giving birth, right in the middle of something absolutely critical... this is beyond vile.

I don’t know if it’d still sensitive or the pressure is odd. but none of the head phones with the squishy head u stick in you ear will work. 

I forget what the surgery is called cus I had it when I was like 9 but, my eardrum was like fully burst and they had to take apart of my skull(or around it Idrk) and fix it

You definitely need to first discuss about your question with your audiologist and the medical team that knows well about the mentioned surgery.

In the meantime, something you might consider is a bone conduction headset that provides a reasonable sound quality for most people.  There are various models out there so shop around.  In my opinion, such technology provides a solution without burdening your ears.",2025-09-29 01:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nt5934/cant_use_headphones_after_surgery/
1nszkdt,hardofhearing,OMG I had no idea this group was a thing! Mind BLOWN!,"Okay, I know the title sounds dramatic, but I genuinely had no idea that so many people were dealing with the same things I have.

I have literally never communicated with \*anyone\* who I can relate to about this stuff.

I had chronic ear infections for the first 5 years of life, when I was 6, I contracted meningitis, and was diagnosed as deaf 1 year later. It sounds unbelievable to say that \*no adults noticed that I was deaf for a YEAR\* but that's really what happened (to say that my parents didn't have their shit together would be an understatement).

My parents immediately had me get a surgical procedure to restore some of my hearing, then I spent the rest of my childhood getting regular surgeries/tubes implanted in my ears.

It never once occurred to them to teach me ASL or to talk to anyone in the deaf community about options. Which, considering that we lived in Fremont, CA (huge deaf school/community), is absolutely bonkers to me. Just endless surgeries for me! Wheee!

I have been HoH forever, but I can read lips okayish and always just got by b/c I didn't want to deal with aides or more procedures when I turned 18 (I'm now 42). I didn't even really think much about my condition until the pandemic, when everyone was in masks, and I realized how much I had actually come to rely on reading lips. I suddenly felt like I on a deserted island or something. I still can't explain it.

Anyways, I'm in a 25-year relationship with the loudest person I know, and we have three really loud kids, lol. My friends all know about my hearing, and I am lucky to have found people who will raise their voice for me regularly.

I am honestly so lucky to have people like this; however, since 2020 I've been really aware that no matter how much they understand my situation, they have no real idea what it's like to live like this. For example, even my 'husband' and kids are still shocked when I can't hear some high-pitched sound that my car is making, or the neighbor's generator. ""No, I didn't realize the dishwasher wasn't running, because I can never hear it, anyways"" type stuff.

I'm bad company at a restaurant b/c I can't join in a conversation since I can't hear more than mumbles when I chew. I have to ask people to repeat themselves all day, every day (honestly, this must be so annoying to them). The amount of times that I have just smiled and nodded at who knows what-- omg. Anyways.

I'm just sharing because, well, I've never had anyone to share this with. It's nice not to feel like an odd-woman-out for a change.

If anyone in here has any experience with OTC hearing aids I would love to know how they worked for you. Thanks for taking the time. &lt;3

\*\*\*edit to ask--&gt; How many of you hear constant ringing/whooshing sounds? 

2nd edit--&gt; Thank you to everyone who responded. I am both so touched by your kindness and completely shocked that I went this long without knowing about some of the devices you mentioned. I'm really excited to try some of these things!

This is basically my life, parents included. You're not alone.

Regarding OTC Hearing Aids, they're touch and go for me, none of them really helping a whole lot, but I use them just for that extra bit even if it's minimal at best. I work with speech therapist on various methods especially to help me in group settings and loud environments and I even bought those digital transcription glasses. I'll take anything to help me.

My advice would be talk to your ENT, if not OTC maybe they have access to some top of the line hearing aids that could actually help. I would, but I can't afford those at this moment.

In addition, I whole heartedly recommend speech therapy and individual therapist that specializes with deaf and HoH people to work through your hearing issues that definitely come from not being able to communicate correctly. They can help you build a healthier pattern of communication and advocating for yourself when everyone around you are hearing.

Hope this helps.

Welcome! Might wanna look into a table mic (paired to hearing aids) for restaurants btw. My partner and I hardly go out to eat anymore bc of noise (and I like to cook and it saves us money), but I know your situation may be different.

Hello! HoH here 45f,  I've been using hearing aids for about 20 years and looking at having cochlears done next year. I don't know about where you are, but here in Australia I wouldn't bother with the equivalent of OTC. I tried it and then ended up having to fork out more for new ones a year or two later because there were nothing but problems, but I may have been unlucky. I currently have phonek audeo aids and I love them! I also use a mic called Roger On that is pretty good for noisy situations, not perfect, but damn better than without it. I've seen the caption glasses but so far a bit out of my price range for what they can do, I'm going to let the tech advance a bit then look at it again once I'm settled with my cochlears. 

It's expensive being HoH isn't it! 

Yep I've tinnitus as well, the ringing in the ears, I do find my hearing aids help slightly with that but it's still damn annoying!

Greetings fellow human. I am here and I can’t hear. (but I can read just fine lol) It’s nice to make your acquaintance.

i’d love to pm you, i don’t mind making new friends and no one needs to be alone!!!! my dad lied and kept mine a secret and told folks i passed, i found out as an adult im  hoh and went back into my medical files - and voila i went to my first deaf social this week and it was soooo iverwhelming but im learning and made new friends!!!!

Welcome!  
Your story sounds similar to mine - 

I got hearing aids when I was 30 - most of my life family thought I was quiet 

Hearing aids have made a significant improvement to my life and relationships

Do you have tinnitus?

Constant tinnitus in F major. Get's louder  than the external sounds around me. Wheeee!

Edit: typos

Yeah, I recently found out that I've likely had hearing lost my whole life. We had several family members that grew up hard a hearing, and they never were told to even look into sign language. Apparently It's common for resources to not be talked about.
Sad because so many of us out there struggling and really could have benefited from learning this stuff earlier.

Glad you found community, OP. 

  
Also, shout out to all the LOUD family members/friends! :)

Roger On...?
HOH socials..?
Captiva...?

That's three eye openers today, thanks..

I could have written your post, minus the meningitis. 

I, too, had no idea I was lip reading so much until Covid! I had to start paying more attention to eyes and body language. 

I briefly met two deaf women while I was growing up. One knew how to lip read and it encouraged me to do it too. I wish my parents would have gotten me into ASL classes or something. It's hard to feel like I don't really belong in the Deaf community because I don't sign. I don't feel I belong in the hearing community either because they just don't understand... 

Do you do ever do this? I often watch videos on mute and read the lips of whoever I'm watching and I try to guess what their voice sounds like. Then I unmute and compare. Often times it sounds like their voice in my head. lol (OK, that sounds crazy.)

If you'd ever like an online buddy who has been thrift similar life things, feel free to reach out via DM. Would be happy to hear (ha!) from you.

I was in a somewhat similar situation (not deaf from birth, but progressive hearing loss over time), and I finally decided to try OTC hearing aids a while back. I will still stick with Nova hearing aids, as they've made it much easier for me to follow conversation without constantly asking people to repeat themselves and the background noise reduction also helps a ton in busy places.

I love my Resound hearing aids. Have you had a hearing test done by an ENT?

I have hearing aids from Costco. They’re Phillips, they pair to my phone (I can set it in front of a speaker as a mic), car, and they made a huge impact! Also I have tinnitus (the ringing!) and they actually help with that some too!

iPhones have an accessibility setting called Live Captions. It will real-time caption on your phone screen sounds from the microphone or whatever media your phone is playing. It also has an option to save captions from phone calls.  It's very easy to use and is free (with iPhone purchase of course).

I had my first ear surgery in 1969 and i am about to have my 6th in Oct 2025.

[댓글]
Sounds like you're to the moderate end of it.  I remember hearing some of those things even without aids back when I had a mild loss.  

Hearing aids are information compressors.  The typical range of human hearing volume-wise is like 0 dB to 100 dB which is a factor of like ... a lot... if I recall right from math that means very loud sounds are 10,000,000,000 times more powerful than very quiet sounds.  Decibels are non-linear.

Not just the frequency but also the dynamic, the volume level, is received by the ear and processed by the brain.  And we lose so much of that with hearing aids.

The quietest softest sounds have to be smushed to fit in the decibel range that we can hear.  For me at the higher frequencies it's like this 10 dB window up at around 100 dB (very loud!).

So *screech*.  All those sounds you mention the high frequency component, when I turn my hearing aids way up, is presented to me as *screech* because *screech* is the only thing I can hear. 

I still recognize most of the sounds.  It's part of why I don't usually identify as deaf. I have a brain that's wired for sound.  Like I was shaving the other day with my hearing aids in.  (I don't normally.)  I guess I was hearing shaving for the first  time in a long time, probably since I was a young man, and there's this uniquely hoarse gritty raspy *scrape* sound.  And it didn't even startle me it was implicitly familiar as the sound of hair being cut by a razor.  I remembered it and it was comforting!   But it also sounded a bit wrong, too harsh, too loud.

Oh well.  I find with hearing aids, they make me aware of things like someone knocking or even just talking outside in the hall -- better than for a lot of hearing people with good hearing.  But only in terms of detecting noises and hearing in real silence from a distance.  And only when I have them cranked up louder than I find pleasant.

Mixed bag.  The world is so loud!  You forget.   But not completely.  It comes back quick.",2025-09-28 12:18:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nsmw0b/realising_these_things_make_sound/
1ns3bxo,hardofhearing,Very thin ear drum,"Hi, interested to hear of any experiences from people who have a very thin ear drum. Used to have ear problems as a kid only in my left and I've just started the gym and when I lift weights pressure builds in my ear like I'm on a plane.

I had it syringed a few years ago and the nurse was shocked that I'm not in pain and said that if she knew my eardrum was so thin she would never have syringed it. Apparently it's that thin they only way she could see if was there was that she could see some of the blood vessels but could actually see straight through it and all the little bones etc that you wouldn't normally be able to see. My other ear is normal.

Apart from this pressure problem I've started to get I also suffer from vertigo at random but it can be quite bad. I'm guessing there's no cure for something like this but I've wondered if anyone has something similar and has any suggestions on what helps?

1nrbp9s,hardofhearing,I built this app for my HoH partner.,"My partner is HoH and struggles in certain situations where someone is not speaking loud enough or next to her.

In June Apple announced new speech to text models coming in iOS 26, and I saw a chance to build something that could help. I am a software engineer, and after months of testing and refining, I just launched [Hearing Buddy](https://hearingbuddyapp.com), a real-time transcription app designed for her but hopefully useful for many.

What makes it different?

* Unlimited high quality captions are free forever. Captions should not be a luxury.
* Everything is processed on-device. No data ever leaves your phone, and no recordings or transcripts are sent anywhere.
* It works completely offline after setup, so you can run it any time without worrying about limits or connection.
* Pro features include speaker detection, AI-powered summaries, and streaming captions to Mac or Apple Watch.

I built Hearing Buddy for my partner, but I want to make it better for anyone who needs it. I would love your feedback.

Here is a code for a free year of Pro if you want to try those features: **HOHBUDDIES**

Redeem here: [https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=6747363502&amp;code=HOHBUDDIES](https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=6747363502&amp;code=HOHBUDDIES)

If you are interested in beta testing new releases as they come out, please comment here and I will send you an invite to the TestFlight group. Thanks a bunch.

What a good idea.  Does it work with different accents?

I’ve been trying to develop something like this in my free time! Thank you!
Just a couple of questions:
Do you recommend getting external microphones? What is the best setup? Even in noisy situations.

Following - when I get updated to IOS 26

I would be interested but I haven’t got iOS 26 yet. Desperately looking for something to use in work and social environments, so excited to test this out

This will be fun to try.

I'm interested in betas! Thank you for making this. Very generous to offer one year free.

I really want to test this out. I work with kids and am still learning sign so an interpreter wouldn’t be beneficial for me at the moment.

I would love to be part of the TestFlight group!

omg i need this thank you!!

That is so amazing, thank you for doing this!!
Unfortunately I am an android user .. 😭💔

What is the difference between this app and Otter?

Wow awesome and thanks for the year trial. This definitely looks quite useful for me. Going to have to try it with the apple watch.

Is there a version for Android?

I tried downloading but my iOS is too old. I guess I’m gonna hafta upgrade my old phone.

Seems amazing so far! Can’t wait to try it out at work next week and see how it compares to Otter, which I am somewhat ambivalent about. Thank you!!

1nqt405,hardofhearing,Learning ASL with apps + regional signs question,"Hi everyone,
I’m HOH and live in a rural area of southern Oklahoma where there aren’t many options for in-person ASL classes. I’ve taken ASL 1 in person, then ASL 1 as a refresher and ASL 2 through the Oklahoma School for the Deaf’s website.

Lately, I’ve been using this app to keep practicing. I like that it gives me good practice tools and even has you work on making full sentences, not just single signs.

My concern is that I’ve noticed a lot of regional signs are used in my area, and I don’t want to come across as “foolish” if what I’m learning in the app doesn’t always match what people here use.

Has anyone else run into this? Do you think apps are still worth it in the long run, or should I focus on different resources? Any advice or suggestions would mean a lot

1nqq6n0,hardofhearing,This is so isolating,"Before my hearing aids were ruined in a car accident i still could barely hear in loud environments and people wouldn’t accommodate because they figured hearing aids magically fixed me.

Two years without them and man im still isolated. Even at work if more than one person is talking i can’t understand anyone. Im glad i like my own company but its been harder lately to deal with the isolation. Went out with an old friend and he was pretty peeved i had trouble hearing him and he had to speak up. Went out with coworkers and a lot of it was me standing in silence while they talked because they forgot i was HoH while we were out. 

Im going out with more coworkers this weekend to a sports bar and i cant be excited about it. Ugh. 

Now its like, do i get hearing aids again and have people completely give up on accommodating? The 10% of effort people could be assed to give? Ill still have loved ones snapping at me. $4,000 with insurance before. Now my insurance is worse and the one place that takes it is booked until February. 

I cant read lips or sign. Im just tired of feeling alone! This sucks hard lately and its been harder to not snap at people when they get mad that i didnt hear them the first time. Maybe it was the hearing aids? Oticons cros. I dont know. I hope youre all having a good night! 

Edit: thank you guys, youve been very sweet. It helps to hear different perspectives and the advice as well. ❤️ hope to get new ones feb. :)

Yes, you should get hearing aids.

Yes, you should learn sign language.

You simply need to arrange your life so that those things are possible. 

Personally, I get isolated even with hearing aids. Don’t take inclusion for granted. As HoH it’s something that takes huge amounts of work.

I completely understand what it’s like. People don’t get annoyed at blind people for not seeing but if you can’t hear it seems ok to be irritated. Costco has reasonably priced hearing aids with a membership, if you wanted to try them again. They won’t help in noisy environments but in the office they are ok.

I understand you completely. I am deaf and have a CI but even with the CI it can be so hard to hear people especially groups or in a noisy place. It’s like being in a roomful of people who don’t speak my language. I can hear their voices but can’t understand their words. It is especially painful when I realize I am missing chances to develop friendships because I can’t just chit chat with the people around me. I’m alone at work because I can’t follow the conversation and I am alone outside of work because no one puts in the time to get to know the stranger who needs you to repeat yourself.

Are you in the US? If so, you can check with your state's vocational rehab office. My state paid for my last pair of hearing aids but you have to open a case and ask.

I am HoH as well and the experience is, indeed, quite isolating. I can’t hear regular people taking but I don’t sign either, so I can’t communicate with  deaf folks. I fit in nowhere. We need people though. That human connection is far more important than we realize. I’ve been told I have to find a community where I would fit in. I’m looking into online sign language classes, but honestly, at the end of the work day, I barely have the time and energy to make my family dinner, let alone learn a whole new language. So, I don’t have any great answers for you. I’m just commiserating with you.

i do personally think you should try lipreading- there is a website i have used in the past to help my lipreading, i could find it if you’d like

I was born with a bineural loss-discovered at 5 yrs old. Been wearing hearing aids for years-always disappointed until this last pair I bought-of all places? On AMAZON. Yes, it’s now permissible to sell hearing aids online straight to consumer.
I’d highly recommend these but I honestly didn’t think they work for my moderate to severe loss.

I use to be mild to moderate range when younger but I’m middle age now.  I’m using them at home mainly and doctor visits. So environment is super noisy.    I’ve bought hearing aids on line before after spending thousands on state of the art hearing aids and being let down.
Not to mention out of money-which my father had generously laid out.

That 6 grand expense is what made me angry enough to forego audiology places that sell hearing aids.  My last pair from Amazon? It’s the best pair I ever owned and yes,even I am shocked to state that!

Totally agree about the isolation..

I had one eardrum removed surgically did to chronic cholesteatoma, so down to one ear hearing.. that was 20 year ago.

Remaining ear requires an aid. As a veteran my hearing aids are supplied by the VA, thankfully. I have also purchased the occasional hearing device. These are the new crop of hearing aids marketed directly to consumers, although they can't call them'hearing aids'.

They are quite affordable and frankly do some to be of some help with hearing. However, all aids seem to suffer from the inability to actually act like original equipment ears...😉

At least now I can hear the TV shows, of course I am reading the captions along with the dialog. Fortunately the ads are not captioned yet, that is a relief... :-)

The isolation remains... One on one in a quiet environment is possible, and really great.. However, how often do you get that opportunity...? Infrequently at Best...I have a standing lunch date with an old friend, we go to a local tavern, mid afternoon, when it is usually almost empty...I sit him on my remaining ear side, and we can get thru it ok. Two old guys, sitting at the bar, having a chat. Almost the only socialization I get these days. 

I am 81, living alone in my own home... My domestic partner passed 18 months ago ... My hearing impairment was always an irritation for us, and understandably so. It's difficult to express endearments when you have to shout, or to have to look at each other when talking so I could see her lips move... She was a total loving creature but it was difficult, at best, for her, for us both, actually, to just have mild innocuous conversation...🫤

 There are seniors activities here in my rural town, the noise level at these functions makes it impossible to join in, promoting further isolation... 

You really have to like yourself when you are hearing impaired...
The thought of being social, even though much desired, is an almost impossible task in the hearing world, for those of us impaired...

I'm sorry you're going through this rough patch. Have you looked into some organizations? There might be somebody that can  help get the cost down.

Remember there are table mics, too, which can also connect to your hearing aids. I’m older now so most of these problems don’t impact me (not to say that I’m not more isolated, though, to your point). Perhaps shifting your interests a title - instead of loud bars and restaurants - doing more one on one activities. I don’t feel lonely bc I have a gf who is an introvert and we don’t like loud, busy places anyway. I still have many moments, though, where I struggle socializing. I get it. Even my office is a bit of an open office. I turn my aids down and listen to ambient music and then, if I feel like socializing, I come out of my cube.

I get this so much. Hearing aids don’t fix everything, but they take off some of the weight. Without them it’s all on you, and that’s exhausting.

I hated my Oticon BiCROS (I’m deaf in my left ear,moderate/severe on the right)) they just frustrated me. like you i give up for big chunk of my life and isolate myself because hearing was just a whole job, until a good audiologist help me found the right set up. Now I just use one Phonak Audéo Sphere Infinio on my right and it’s the best I’ve ever had. Total game changer. I also got a cochlear on my left, which helps, but even with all the tech I still miss lots of things and need accommodations and lots of underestanding. That part never goes away.

It’s a fight, but one worth taking, you deserve to be included!!

You will probably find that new hearing aids will work better than your old ones did. Your hearing is never going to be perfect, and unfortunately it will always be a struggle. I deal with it too.

Hi, where are you from? There are non-profits for situations like this where you can get the help you need to cover the cost of hearing aids. [Here’s](https://www.pacifichearingconnection.org/become-a-patient) an example of one near me. Hearing aids are expensive but there are ways to get help. I’d really recommend looking into it.

I feel for you. It's not something I deal with much, but I'm an ass about it if people don't make the effort to include me.  My hearing loss is a sex linked genetic trait. That means all the men on my fathers side have hearing issues. The severity differs, but we all have it.  If you are feeling snarky, make a button that says functionally deaf, speak be ignored!  When people get aggravated I can't hear or understand them I just remind them they were told and it's not my fault they didn't listen.  I get rude depending on the situation.   I would highly advise learning ASL and even when you understand them sign rather than talk.  Then as over the top as you can apologize and say you forgot they don't sign.  Another one i employ is telling them what i heard them say and when they say that isn't even close feign relief because you were worried they were having a stroke,  and oh yeah, YOU'RE DEAF. SO SPEAK UP.  Like I said, I'm a bit of a jerk about this.  As for practical help, I use a translation app or talk to text when having conversations.  It's not perfect but it helps.

In my state the department of deaf and hard of hearing also offers therapy to help you cope.  This is a life altering opportunity.  A therapist who has worked with deaf and hard of hearing people can help you develop skills to handle your work and social needs and help you develop strategies to find resources.  In my state it is free.

Using speech to text is helpful in situations when you can't understand. But I agree with others. State voc rehab and learn sign language

This is a very common feeling for HOH people, and it sucks because hearing people can never understand where we are coming from. You can try explaining things to people about your situation and how you’ve been feeling, most people unfortunately never remember our disability since it is invisible. Sometimes I want to get “hard of hearing” tattooed across my forehead so people don’t forget 😭 I would always recommend learning sign language as well! The unfortunate downside is most people don’t know the language, and I’m almost positive none of the people you hang out with and feel isolated around know it either, and probably won’t care to learn it. It’s hard to come to terms with sometimes. If you haven’t already I’d definitely try explaining your situation to your friends and loved ones. Hearing aids always help, but you shouldn’t have to feel forced to get them.

My tinnitus would ruin me forever and drive me insane if I didn’t have the audio stimulation of hearing aids

I think I have a similar degree of hearing loss to you and yes, the most impactful aspect is how isolating it is. Pubs and restaurants are completely out and socialising is really hard. I use hearing aids and have got reasonably good at lipreading (I'd say I use it 40% of the time roughly) but that hasn't made a whole bunch of difference to the isolation really. At the same time, the demands placed on you, family, work etc are exactly the same as when I could hear. It's a difficult thing to go through and all I can recommend really is making the time to develop the skills that you need to cope a little better with it. And be a bit grumpy and selfish regarding accommodation of your hearing loss with work etc.",2025-09-26 02:50:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nqq6n0/this_is_so_isolating/
1nqhh09,hardofhearing,Hearing aids and cold ears,"Autumn is knocking on my door and with it my favourite hat is making his comeback. Unfortunately I have a new best friend called Phonak and the two don't get along. Without a hat my ears get super cold and I am quite prone to infections. With a hat my hearing aids are practically rendered useless. Has anyone got a useful workaround? I'm willing to cut holes into the hat to loop the microphone part through but I'm not sure that would hold either.

I wear earmuffs and that's been working for me for years now!!

I haven’t had this issue with knit hats.

Is it very tight or something?",2025-09-25 20:20:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nqhh09/hearing_aids_and_cold_ears/
1nqeagu,hardofhearing,"lack of support rn, anyone have any advice or kind words?","So i'm waiting to see my doctor about getting a more in depth hearing test done and seeing an ent/respiratory specialist as i have reoccuring chest infections, apparently a history of pneumonia, rlly painful airplane ear that makes me lose a chunk of my hearing afterwards, etc etc  
ive had the basic beep test done and it was supposedly alright, but it was done by my local pharmacy for free and not by a specialist  
I'm fine hearing high pitched sounds, but everything else gets really muffled, especially when theres multiple things to focus on  
i have to focus on things to make sense of whatever im hearing, and im exhausted, i am so tired of having to pay attention to conversations and music lyrics and even the door knocking, even on the phone it has to be on speaker or i wont know what the other person is saying  
i feel like im missing so much and in conversations with more than one person i end up so confused  
i was off ill for the first few weeks of my college course because i was in hospital for reacting to a medication, and then off ill because of a chest infection. im finally back this week and socialising with my class, and im missing chunks of conversations and straining to hear my lecturers if things get a bit loud elsewhere  
lowkey is it normal to have to focus on sounds this much? if where i am is quiet i dont struggle so much, but its impossible to make the world silent enough for me to be able to hear good  
i have some friends that struggle with processing words but the way they describe it just doesnt sound like me, im not processing and taking a moment to respond im just straight up missing things or the words sound muddy and unclear  
its so isolating, i dont know anyone who struggles with hearing like i do but because my beep test was fine and im not diagnosed with anything i dont feel right going to any local support groups for hoh/Deaf people

Would ""like being underwater"" be accurate at all ?  does it come and go somewhat with sinus and chest congestion? 

""really painful airplane ear"" and ""muffling"" and the fact of doing okay on a high pitch beep test is suggesting some sort of conductive thing but I'm no expert

It sounds like you're taking the right action by seeing an ENT.  Your doc will probably suggest an audiologist.  Get a real hearing test done right.  There are tests for your ability to understand language under various conditions.  Like they'll say words and you repeat them back and they'll add increasingly loud masking noise.  

It's definitely possible to score quite badly on those while having ""normal"" hearing on the beep test.

Opinions differ on how to interpret that effect.  Is it hearing loss?  Does it originate in the middle ear, cochlea, or nervous system?  Is auditory processing disorder under hearing loss? 

In terms of hard of hearing or deaf support services -- it sounds like you can't hear and understand speech very well.  I wouldn't say you're in the wrong place based on that.  But don't rush into anything or to any conclusions just yet, either.  (Other than treating the medical side of it urgently.)  In particular, if you need interpreting services and they are available, use them.

I feel for you, it can be maddening to get an appointment with the right person that is qualified to run the right tests to determine what’s going on. I’ve been in hearing aid offices where they were selling artwork, crafts and other items in addition to the audiology services. As soon as I stepped through the front door, I knew I wasn’t going to get anywhere. 

I was then finally referred to an audiologist that did nothing but audiology exams and dispense hearing aids from the well known manufacturers. I was in her office for four hours having a battery of tests run that I had read about, but never seen. By the end of the appointment, I had a definite diagnosis of Vestibular Migraine with a 60% hearing loss in my left ear and 100% speech discrimination loss in my left ear. She referred me to a surgeon to be evaluated for a Cochlear Implant. 

It took me Five years to get to that point, and another two years to get an implant. 

I was frightened by the number of people out there claiming to be hearing health providers, that can barely administer an audiology exam, and seem to be there to sell $5,000 hearing aids whether they help you or not. 

I am sorry you are going through this, but don’t give up, help is out there. Eventually, you will find someone that can help you, just don’t accept second best.

I would go to an audiologist. They can test your middle ear to see if you have negative pressure. This can happen when you have congestion and it sounds like you’ve dealt with a lot of that lately. Issues with middle ear pressure usually affect the low to mid frequencies first, which would also match up. 

They can test your detection of pure tones (beeps) in the presence of background noise. They can also give you a speech discrimination test (so they’re not just seeing at what levels you can detect sound, but determine what speech sounds you are or aren’t hearing clearly) with background noise. 

I’ve dealt with temporary hearing loss from middle ear issues before. I also felt tired, isolated, and frustrated. Hang in there!",2025-09-25 18:17:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nqeagu/lack_of_support_rn_anyone_have_any_advice_or_kind/
1nptgv1,hardofhearing,Married to HOH husband who won't wear hearing aids,"I'm so frustrated with this situation. My husband, who has had hearing aids for about a decade hates wearing them just won't wear them around me (he wears them all day at work). They are the kind that you can barely see - he just hates how they feel in his ears and some noises (like a dish banging) are way too piercing for him.  It took several years of arguing over him being hard of hearing and him trying to reverse it to say I am then we both got our hearing tested and lo and behold, he had significant hearing loss. I felt happy he finally got hearing aids, but irritated I had to endure being blamed for his hearing loss.

As a result of this, he will not ever wear his hearing aids at home. Obviously, this results in decreased communication between us, which is already an issue. He mumbles because it feels loud to him when he talks but gets mad at me if I ask him to repeat himself (and jumps on the opportunity to say ""you're so hard of hearing!"" when, after him getting hearing aids, I have never said such a thing to him), and of course, he has a really hard time hearing me. When he can't hear what I say, sometimes he just won't respond but I know he heard that I said something so I have to ask ""did you hear me?"" and then he gets mad. So I just always assume he didn't hear me to give him the benefit of the doubt. But when I do that and he DID hear me, he's offended.

God forbid we go out anywhere. We just don't talk at dinner. I've suggested us learning sign language, but he refuses to do this. My conclusion is just that he doesn't really WANT to hear me. On my birthday we went out to dinner and he actually wore his hearing aids and had a really nice dinner; I felt listened to and we had a nice conversation. But I don't want it to be a once a year thing.

Is this normal? Do other couples deal with this? I don't mind being married to someone hard of hearing, but I feel like he needs to come to terms with it. Until then, I'm sorta dangling out here with someone who shuts down.

I’m hard of hearing and wear bilateral cochlear implants. I totally understand being tired from listening all day at work and not wanting to talk at home. When I get home, I have a few hours of what I call deaf time - not wearing my implants and doing my own thing. However, I still wear my implants when talking with my mom - over dinner, walking the dog, etc. My suggestion is to suggest this compromise to your husband. Best of luck!

I understand this. I am always so tired at the end of the working day where I’ve had to wear my hearing aids. I feel overwhelmed and desperate to get the unnatural feeling away from me. Typically I have a headache and the noises that get over amplified just irritate me. 

Your husband sounds irritated and somewhat resentful, at the aids and at you. 

It sounds like there have been some not very respectful behaviours developed on both sides. He’s clearly feeling some stigma attached to having lost some hearing and has an angry retort for you when you don’t hear him.  In return, you asking “did you hear me?” I am certain has the potential to annoy and even hurt him. It’s got an accusatory tone to it which highlights what he might feel is his weakness each time you say it. When all is said and done, he’s human and will want to feel that he’s still as capable as ever. 

I would suggest some counselling where you get to the root of his feelings and of course your own.

Sometimes it's the brand of hearing aids that are cause. I had hearing aids that did not feel right because it did not sound right or clear . (Hard to explain) But then I had an audiologist switch brands and it made all other difference.

I can’t stand wearing my hearing aids any longer than I absolutely have to. The amplified sound in the world is so jarring and discordant, and it’s non-stop all day while I’m away from home. It’s nice to hear all the hidden sounds in music, but that’s it. 

It might help you to understand if you try to think of it this way: you know how it feels when you’ve been in a darkened theater for hours (or have your eyes dilated at the optometrist?) then you step outside into harsh, bright sunlight? Other people outside are carrying on with their day and for them the light is fine— it’s normal. But while your eyes are readjusting, the sunlight is overwhelming. 

Now try to imagine that your eyes never really readjust. That light (sound with hearing aids) is always overwhelming, sometimes painful. It would be exhausting navigating your entire day, every day, under harsh light. Other people are operating comfortably because that’s their “normal”, but it causes you fatigue. 

When you get back home you can turn the lights back down to your comfort zone and finally relax. 

Maybe for your husband, you insisting on him wearing the hearing aids is like someone firing up stadium lights pointed right at your face after you already spent all day under harsh lights. 

I get overstimulated every time I wear my hearing aids. Even paper rustling has a sound. My dog’s shrill bark makes my brain quiver and try to crawl out of my ears. 

If I had to wear my hearing aids at home I’d be too irritable to be around. If my spouse insisted I wear them, I’d feel like he didn’t understand what he was asking from me. I’d rather go fully deaf than have to hear everything most people hear all the time. It’s torture. The only relief comes when I can pull out the hearing aids and stop the cacophony. 

Another thing you might not realize is that it’s harder to “listen” again after you remove hearing aids. It’s almost like I get lazy with my listening when I’m wearing the hearing aids because the hearing aids are filling in all the blanks (the missing sounds) I'd usually have to piece together by following context. When I pull the earpieces out I have to actively listen again (follow people room to room, watch their faces, ask them to face me when they speak) and piece together context clues to understand speech and noise again at home. Even so, I just want to yank the earpieces out, turn on the video captions, and finally have peace. 

My husband would get rid of my hearing aids altogether if it was his call (they make me so crabby and he knows they hurt my ears and my head), but I need them during the daytime. 

We text each other a lot at home. He puts captions on TV and HBO has an ASL interpreter on a lot of movies (you can learn ASL at home— look up Dawn Sign Press Interactive series). Maybe your husband doesn’t want to take an outside class, but he might be open to one you can take at home. Signing is more fun than he’d think. The first time I watched my husband sign ""Want(a) Pile(of) Chicken Wings"" lives in my head. 

Your husband sounds stubborn, yes, but I get it. Maybe if you wore really loud AirPods all day (even past the point where your head aches and your ears are sore) to simulate how uncomfortable it is to listen to loudness all day, it would make more sense. I feel sad when I think that my husband might feel the same way you do, because I love him and want to communicate with him. But I know he hates my hearing aids more than I do because they make me miserable… and he’s my sanctuary and my comfort at the end of the day when I finally turn off the sound to be at home.

How old are the aids? If recent, last couple of years, he most likely needs to have the programming adjusted by his audiologist.

So everyone in my house has hearing aids (me, hubby, and my dad). I hate mine. I love them when I’m on the phone and everything goes right into my ears, but I have very small ears (was born prematurely) and I wear glasses, so when I have both on it HURTS. Plus like others said, hearing fatigue is a big thing. 

My 84 year old dad has discovered that he can watch videos and reels on his phone with it going straight to his HAs while watching TV. It’s like he’s 17. 

My husband is frequently in work meetings (WFH) and he doesn’t hear anything else. 

Our solution is to just text each other to get their attention and then we can either respond via text or put down whatever it is if we need to and talk to each other. It’s not perfect but it works for us.

I had Receiver-In-Canal (RIC) hearing aids with the processor that sits behind the ear.  Because I also wear glasses and hats, my ears would hurt by early evening.  After 3 years, I purchased In-The-Canal (ITC) hearing aids which I can wear comfortably from the time I get up to the time I go to bed.  The hearing aids I purchased look like ear buds, but are much more comfortable.  They are the Signia Active Pro IX with rechargeable batteries that last up to 34 hours on a charge.  Just pop them in the charger before I go to sleep and they are ready the next morning when I wake up.

Listening fatigue is a thing. Imagine someone holding a microphone up to your ears. 
Everything is amplified. It can cause sensory overload. 

Have you thought about different types of communication?

So my thoughts here are about how exhausting hearing loss is. I’m 38 and lost my hearing this year. And for the first half of this year, I GET IT. The brain is consistently working twice as much because we are looking for visual cues as well as trying to decipher the words being said, place them in a sentence that makes sense, hope that is the sentence you are saying and do it in a split second because there is another word coming right after. This is exhausting after 8 hours. With a hearing aid it’s supposed to be better but no it’s just louder. So small sounds become more prominent than they should be and voices are just as muffled as they were just louder. Which helps… but that help only extends so far. With hearing aids they don’t improve your hearing, they amplify to reach the depths of where you can hear. 

I think that he wore his hearing aids for your birthday dinner is because he does value you and for that night he had to put your need out front and show you that. Maybe it’s lip service for your birthday but in that he did that at all tells me he values you and wanted to show you preference. I don’t know how old he is but I know the mental toll hearing loss can inflict and I’m sorry you have to bear with it. But I think trying to understand him and commiserating with the fragility of his condition could end up going a long way so that he feels seen so you can be heard, if that makes any sense. He is older I’m guessing, not a lot of capacity for putting his feelings into words, so his anger is getting displaced lashing out at you. No one likes to feel like they are getting older or frail both things hearing aids make you feel and exacerbated by the exhaustion hearing loss brings with it. But he should not be taking it out on you. There is no excuse for that. 

Until I went to an audiologist with my wife she didn’t really understand what I was going through. It’s something that unless it’s happening to you it’s really hard to put into words. I do understand how badly you miss that connection and I understand how desperate and unseen that can make you feel. But it’s something he can’t control. Even with hearing aids he can’t control it. Hang in there. He has a lot of pride but he’s always had that I’d wager. You’ll get more flies with honey than earwax.

Have you talked with the professionals who set up his hearing aids and let them know that hes just feeling too loud? They should be able to adjust the hearing aids to his comfort level. Better ywt, does he have a remote control app to do that himself? Listening fatigue is a real thing that on nights im home alone, as soon as im home, shoes off, bra off then ears off.

Coming home and taking off your HAs after a long day of listening is like coming home and taking off your tight shoes (or your bra🤣)
It’s good to just sit in a little bubble of quiet. 
Could you ask him to perhaps wear his HAs during your sit down dinner time each night so you can really talk to each other, even though it might only be half an hour. Or perhaps even 2/3 times a week. It might be a good compromise.

I echo what others have said. It may also be that if he finds certain sounds piercing still, then he could have the settings looked at, have them adjusted slightly, or create a new ‘home’ setting that works to reduce loud noises but still provide a better hearing opportunity compared to not wearing them.

I feel if you don’t wear them all the time you don’t really learn how to hear properly through them as your own ears, therefore fuelling the issue some more.

Hearing fatigue is defo a thing though. It’s knackering.

I completely get why you're frustrated. It sounds like he hasn't quite adapted to being HOH just yet, and for hearing people, this can be a bit of an identity struggle... even a decade long one! My son is deaf and wears bilateral cochlear implants and I encourage him to have time in the house without them on, as listening  fatigue is very, very real and can be extremely draining. That being said, I think there's room for compromise in communication methods and expectations. When I need to get my son's attention, I flicker the lights or tap him. Sometimes I throw something small in his direction and we get a good chuckle out of it (keep in mind, my son is a teenager so he finds it funny lol not sure how a grown man would feel or how playful he is). It may be less frustrating for both of you if you don't have to shout repeatedly to get his attention. If it's important or urgent, write a note. He may be stubbornly resisting adapting to new strategies, but theres lots of little things you can do to start. There's a chance he'll adjust better to you just making the adjustments vs. you telling him to make them. If he isn't willing to learn ASL fully, try starting with a handful of signs to use around the house and just start using them when theres a need for it. He'll catch on. Ultimately, it'll make things easier on him too. Hearing people's lives kind of revolve around talking and so it just sounds like you both have to figure out ways to continue to connect with a bit less of it. There is a happy medium here somewhere! Best of luck to you.

A speech to text app helps a whole awful lot, but I swear the thing they subscribe to hates me specifically, it does a pretty good job for other voices though.

iPhone has a standard accessibility feature that does speech to text, which is what I use when their phone isn’t out.  I think google has a live transcribe thing that’s also free.

He needs to have a dead guy-to-other-deaf-guy conversation. If he’s either syracuse/roch area or chicago area, i could chat with him because maybe he needs to see for himself through other deaf guys who has have successful relationships and unsuccessful conversations as a Deaf male if that makes sense

My HoH husband doesn’t wear his hardly at all. I am an RN and appreciate all of these comments. 
His doctor has told him many times that studies show a link between not wearing HA and dementia. He still is not consistent. It’s only since our kids have said something that he is wearing them. If your husband is wearing them 8 hours a day he is reducing his risk for dementia. Maybe letting him know how he is helping his health longterm by doing that and how grateful you are for that. Maybe think about a compromise  that would work for you both weekends maybe to start. I sure wish my husband was wearing his 8 hours a day. But  I feel your pain.

It takes time to adjust to hearing aids. That may be some of the issue. But there also sounds like a problem with stubbornness and disrespect. It's one thing for him to have some downtime after work and have a break from them. It's another to never wear them when around you and to be rude about it. He knows he can't hear you. That should bother him and he should want to correct that. I'd see if he's willing to go to marriage counseling.

Those reactions to random acute noise are not uncommon. I’m sure you could figure out how to be quieter. It’s not just clanging, it’s crushed ice, too, and incredibly difficult to not be constantly barraged by these. 

In restaurants it’s a mix of that and the din from conversations. In conversation with people it’s extremely taxing and frustrating for both sides. It’s not the “settings” or “need a new HA,” it’s just the lack of experience and adaptation of different communication strategies. 

I don’t find aids uncomfortable but we do like to clear out brains after an aural assault. And, if in conversation, give us some time to change settings because of nuances in settings. Automatic settings sometimes need to be overridden for situations but you need to think of aids being like dial up internet and not instantaneous like the rest of our electronics. (Phonak Virto P70 wearer here). And while it was a top model a few years ago its replacement isn’t going to be magically different. And , it isn’t easy to casually pop $5k down for a new pair. 

My aids work much better streaming content than having them amplify the tv, cellphone, computer in the presence of the din and we can have the response tailored for that mode but just because you can get our attention we still need to change a setting. 

It’s not like you think. 

I say repeatedly if l heard as well as I see without glasses it’d be amazing but sadly it isn’t. It’s a very fatiguing condition. 

Look at restaurants attributes that make it hard, proximity to the kitchen, reflective surfaces, and other sounds. You may need to eat at less popular and lively restaurants. And he may just need a pair of hearing aids with the features. 

Ask about what the situations sound and feel like too. 

Sorry if this isn’t helpful

Has he seen an audiologist recently for a hearing aid tune up? Or to see if he’s eligible for a new set?

I get it and sometimes need to take it off for an hour especially if the noise been loud. That being said, if he finds certain noises piercing, he can go to the audiologist and them them adjust it. The beauty of digital hearing aids is that they’re so programmable to adjust to different sounds. I had to do that a couple of times and now it’s not as bad.  Do I have the odd days where I literally cannot wear it?  Sure but I make sure to communicate with my family so they’re aware and I still try to get involved even if it’s a few words or animated hands and a few signs (I only know a few but we choose the common ones when needed). Your husband needs to make an effort.  

Tell him to see that audiologist to adjust the programming. Also have him consider taking them off at work at lunchtime. It can be the breather that he needs.  I do that on occasion and it helps me get through evenings because my ear is not done by end of day.

i can definitely sympathize with him. i struggle just to wear my 1 hearing aid a full day at work because some noises can be too much, everything can be over stimulating. Taking it out when i get home is comparable to the sweet relief of taking a bra off after a long day 😂 i don't live with my partner yet but i do know it can be frustrating for him at times when he is trying to tell me something and either i straight up don't hear him or misheard what he said. When we move in together i do plan on wearing it more at home, though like another user said i might have my deaf times where i just need a break. 

He sounds salty about having to get hearing aids. i dont know if it's directly because of you saying he needed them, if he's embarrassed by them like it's emasculating or something. like there's nothing wrong with having them. You could try having a discussion about your frustrations but also be clear that he can also vent his frustrations as well just so it doesn't seem accusatory or laying all the blame on him. this is if he is willing to talk about it in the first place.

I am the same way. However, I only wear one hearing aid. I only feel the need for it when I am in a different environment to where I actually struggle bad with hearing people. Places like work, a loud restaurant, or going in public etc. I view home as a quiet place, especially after I’ve been at work all day.

It gets better with time. He needs to wear at least 8 hours a day. Eventually he should use all day every day until he goes to sleep. Hearing aids not only help you hear; they help stave off dementia as well..

I think this is very normal, I’ve worn hearing aids since I was 4 and only for about the first couple years did I wear them 24/7. Taking your hearing aids out can feel similar to taking your bra off. My parents always fought with me over this, even took me to the audiologist one time and she made me feel so horrible about my decision that she made me cry. It’s hard for me to see the other side, since I’m someone who’s in your husband’s shoes, but I can definitely tell understand how it could be frustrating. Especially when the person is getting angry at you for them not being able to hear, which I am guilty of as well. I always need to take a step away and reflect when I start getting angry. One suggestion I have is maybe you guys could learn ASL together. It’s actually super fun, and that way if he can’t hear you, you can easily communicate in a different way. I think it’s great though that you’re trying to learn about things from his point of view and trying to find solutions to make communicating easier

I hate my hearing aids as well. It’s really hard especially because the noises do pierce my ears and the more noise there is the worse it is. They personally make my ears itch a lot. Also it’s mentally exhausting. So I very much understand him on that. It’s hard for hearing people to understand the full struggles of someone who is hard of hearing. I hate talking. Especially when people can’t hear me because I think I’m being really loud. It’s just frustrating. 

I have the opposite problem on that my husband isn’t really learning sign language for me. I think it’s very normal in a lot of cases. I don’t think it’s personal towards you.

Yeah make sure he can see you when you talk so he can lipread. Hearing aids are unnatural and uncomfortable. It takes compromise from both partners. But as a HOH individual, I must say respectfully, I don’t owe anyone to wear MY hearing aids (emphasis on MINE. My tool for my purpose when I choose). If you want to be heard, “speak the language” of the listener. It is the responsibility of the speaker to be heard, not the listener to listen. Good luck. Not easy. Sorry for the struggle. I sympathize.

I have bilateral moderate to severe hearing loss and can completely identify with not wanting to wear hearing aids any more than he has to, BUT i did learn sign language and absolutely love it. For me, it's far as superior to wearing hearing aids in so many situations.  I don’t have any solutions to offer, but I hope you find one that works for both of you!

As someone hard of hearing. Who also barely wears his hearing aids, try and give a little grace. 


I find them exhausting. They kill my ears. Sounds rattle my brain. Is rather just not be able to hear.

I can see how you are frustrated from this. But hearing fatigue is REAL. I had access to hearing aids for a week after I got my hearing tested and was exhausted after work. Like fell asleep for a three hour nap.

Maybe offer him an hour or two hearing break. And while he has his break do the chores he can’t stand while his hearing aids are in or have him do them.

As someone who is hard of hearing, I can hear you but the understanding is what I am lacking. For example this morning my brother had said something I at first thought was highly inappropriate, but I asked him to repeat himself and he had asked me something not even remotely close to what I thought he said at first. So instead of asking if he heard you, ask if he understood.

As a deaf person, you should do some research on listening/hearing fatigue, when you have hearing loss and wear hearing aids it takes so much extra effort to decipher every word someone says and they don’t fix the loss they just aid it and for some not very well so I’d say maybe try to have more patience for it.

As for the blaming each other for loss and arguing who the blame is on it’s on neither of you. It isn’t his fault that his ears aren’t working and it isn’t your fault neither but him lashing out at you for it sounds as if maybe he’s deflecting and isn’t coping as well with his loss? Therapy, counselling, groups to relate with and other things to support him are all pretty easily available so this could potentially be a good way of getting through it?

I think with him not ‘wanting’ to hear you might really be that he does want to hear you but just can’t wrap his head around it being hearing you through a new and unnatural way; it isn’t fair on you at all to be left dangling

For me in my house me and my mum have a compromise of that if we are in the same room and eating/talking with each other I wear my hearing devices but if I have them off and am just watching tv or doing dishes or something I keep them off so I can have my listening breaks and not be too fatigued, maybe you guys could have a conversation to figure out a way that works for you? I hope everything works out well for you :))

I do wonder if counseling would be helpful like others have suggested. I wear bilateral hearing aids and find the noise of the world that I adjusted to not hearing (or mostly hearing less of the intensity) for most of my life, so I generally only wear mine to work or certain settings like group dinners out. It can be very mentally taxing, because we can't ""passively"" listen the way other people can. I find it concerning that he doesn't want to try learning sign language with you though, hence why the counseling could maybe assist in this and finding a way to make it work or find the root problem. My preferred language is ASL and for me, a partner has to be willing to learn and utilize it at home because I don't want to have the burden of being the ""bridge"" in the communication 24/7. It sounds like you're trying really hard to find ways to help your relationship adapt and empathize, and I'm so sorry you're left feeling like he doesn't want to hear you at all. If he refuses counseling, individual counseling to figure out what *you* want going forward might be of benefit too. Your needs in the relationship are not less important than his.

My husband is the same way, but we are retired and he has never been one who likes to chat.  A very stubborn man, he can't hear smoke alarms, or loud bumps like if the refrigerator falls over.  I fell in the shower (and got a concussion), I couldn't get up...and he couldn't hear my cries, but he treated me like an angel for weeks after!   He can't hear me if I am just in the next room, and he lets me know by yelling ""I can't hearrrrr you!""  So I have to stop what I am doing and go to where he is. We have been married 45 years and have worked most things out.  I try not to say ""never mind"" because it sounds rude, but I explained if I say that it's because it really isn't worth repeating, and if it was anything important I make sure he heard me and repeat it.  On the other hand, if I do want to chat, it is now a habit to tap his knee or shoulder to get his attention so we can be face to face.  He is pretty patient most of the time but does occasionally get cranky.  We both remind each other we made vows 45 years ago ""in sickness or in health"".  Best of luck to both of you!

Was he not HH when you met? Why did you marry an HH person if it was going to be so frustrating for you? This post reads so hostile to me. It would hurt my heart if my partner spoke about my lack of hearing this way. 

My suggestion is find another way to communicate (like texting, for example) or find a partner who doesn't have a disability that inconveniences you.",2025-09-25 01:05:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nptgv1/married_to_hoh_husband_who_wont_wear_hearing_aids/

I'm looking for resources to learn ASL while we wait to get her properly tested, diagnosed, and treated. I figure it can't hurt to start teaching sign regardless of how things go. I took ASL in highschool and took to it really well, but that was a LONG time ago, and I'm really rusty. Thanks!

Usually your county or state will offer early intervention for children with diagnosed hearing loss or hard of hearing. It’s completely free. I would look into that

Lifeprint.com is a really great resource for getting started. I became deaf as an adult in college and this is what me and my family/friends used to learn ASL.

We connected with a local organization for deaf and hard of hearing and we were assigned a deaf mentor to help us and our son learn ASL and access other resources. They were super helpful because it was more focused on what we would need for a child. We also use the Lingvano app as a supplemental tool to work more on our own

Depending on the size of the city you live in, there may be a local, regional, or state organization that offers free or reduced cost classes in ASL for family members of deaf/HoH people (look for: schools for the deaf, ""speech and hearing"" or ""resource center"" organizations, by-Deaf-for-Deaf organizations, public libraries, etc). 

If possible, try to learn from a Deaf teacher in in-person classes (zoom as a second choice; basically any way you can get direct feedback on your signing from the teacher) and avoid anything with Alexander Graham Bell's name on it (these orgs tend to promote speech-only or speech-primary modalities which are simply not very effective). 

It's absolutely wonderful that you're taking this step! You may get some pushback from old-school audiologists and teachers, if your child is HoH, but hold strong: a fully accessible language is better than half-grasping an inaccessible language. Luckily, it seems attitudes on ASL vs oralism are changing, and more hearing people than ever know ASL. 

Good luck!

It’s best to google classes in your area for accurate results.




































Edit:spelling

Hard over to r/asl. Theres a pinned post with resources. Also consider r/podc (parent of deaf child)

The community colleges around me all offer ASL classes to those in the community; maybe check there?

Try not to overwhelm yourself with learning ALL THE ASL ALL AT ONCE! Learn signs for her routines (bath, eat, sleep, play, etc) and environment (favorite toys, pets, car, home) and build from there.

Highly recommend Baby Signing Time with Rachel Coleman.  It’s a great starting point for you and your family.  There is an enormous amount of material in her “My Signing Time” series.   You will be so amazed how quickly you and your child will pick it up.  I wish you luck on your journey!",2025-09-24 14:31:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1npdp47/6_months_daughter_might_be_hard_of_hearing/
1nojlph,hardofhearing,How to let people on bikes know I can’t hear them?,"I have mild hearing loss in my right ear and I recently moved to the city and encountered a new problem- when people are approaching me from behind and on my right on a bike, especially if there’s a lot of ambient noise, I can’t hear them. I’ve had a few close calls already, but today someone hit my side (I’m fine, just a few bruises), which sort of made me realize I need to find a solution before something really awful happens. Any ideas? 

[댓글]
I am always looking around.

Are you on foot, or also on a bike?

While pedaling, I find these [Bike Bar End Mirrors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092QKJNPM?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1) very helpful to see when someone is coming up on me.

My beloved wants me to wear a t-shirt that says ""HARD OF HEARING"" or ""DEAF"", but I cannot bring my self to self-label as defective.

I don’t trust people to not take advantage of that. I’ve seen too many cases of people enjoying hitting cyclists. In my opinion, they may target you and use your hearing loss as a way to pin it on you. I recommend you attach a mirror to your handle bar so you are able to see behind you.

Edit: just realized you are not on the bike but rather a pedestrian. Keep looking around when walking. Wearing ID can still make you a target sadly.

You could install mirrors on your handlebar so you can see from behind or you can use this [sign](https://www.worldwidevisible.com/nl/limited-hearing-bordje/a3468) to let other people know that you can’t hear them. I’m not sure if the website ships to countries other than the Netherlands or maybe it’s available on Amazon or such.

Edit: it seems they will only ship to Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands.

In the US, it's most common (and preferred) to pass on the left. This is as true on bicycle and multi-use paths as it is on the road.

If you're also in the US, I suggest deliberately positioning yourself nearer the right side of the trail.  This should encourage bikers to pass you on both your hearing side *and* to pass you in the correct fashion.

I do this and have never had a problem with cyclists unpredictably passing me in a manner where I can't tell which side to duck over to.

You need to be aware of/avoid common bike paths, look over your shoulder regularly, and perhaps keep to the very edge of the path. I know it sucks, I also have to accommodate my disabled self to an unforgiving world, but realistically that’s what we have to do. Honestly I would suggest posting in cycling forums and see what they recommend. They have as much right to the space as you (obviously not to the point of colliding with you).

I'm hard of hearing - consider adding a mirror! Seeing something coming from behind is better than nothing.

Deaf in right ear.  I wear one of those vest with the deaf rider symbol on the back

Do you have mirrors? That would at least help with seeing them, even if you can’t hear them. I just used a bike with nice, big mirrors for the first time and the difference is huge.

Edit: ugh, just saw you’re on foot, not on bike. My only thought would be a jacket that says DEAF or HARD OF HEARING in huge letters on the back. Which I would hate to do because I would feel like it puts a target on my back…

There’s gotta be some way you can use a mirror on foot too

I have a yellow vest that says DEAF on the back that I wear while biking. Even when I wear my hearing aids while on the bike, I'm pretty much deaf with the wind in my ears. I cannot hear people yell out behind me. Since I started wearing my vest, people pass me more cautiously and respectfully. No near misses.

Likely not your fault you got hit and I don’t mean to blame the victim, but as a HoH cyclist I’ve got to tell you that some pedestrians are complete fucking idiots. Be predictable. Especially on MUTs, walk like you’re driving, on the right. Expect people to pass on the left. If you’re walking with a dog, keep the dog on your right and never use an extendy leash.

1no3t9y,hardofhearing,Opinions on live sports closed captioning,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for opinions on **live sports closed captioning** and how it can be made better, especially in big leagues like the **NHL, NFL, and NBA**.

Some questions I’d love your thoughts on:

* What do you think is **good** about sports captioning right now?
* What do you think is **bad** or frustrating about it?
* What would make captioning for live sports **better**?

For people who are **Deaf, Hard-of-Hearing, or low-literacy**, I’d especially like your perspective:

* What type of captions work best for you? Do you want **everything** announcers say shown on screen?
* Would a **shorter, paraphrased version** be more helpful?
* Or would captions focused mainly on **play-by-play commentary** (just what’s happening in the game) work better than including all the side talk and analysis?

Your input would be really valuable. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

[댓글]
Closed caption by definition should be exactly the audio that hearing people hear. So it should transcribe the announcers exactly. 

Paraphrasing or play by play would not be closed captioning.

For me I want everything announcers are saying shown on the screen, but high enough or away from the play action on the tv. It’s frustrating when I can’t see the play because captions blocked it. I just turn the captions off and watch the game but it’s annoying when they are discussing an important call, a challenge, etc.

I want everything announcers say shown on screen. Like another commenter said, the main issue is when the captions block important things on the screen. For live sports the screen is packed with things I want to read, so it would be nice to put captions in a thoughtful spot by default. 



Why are you grouping ""low-literacy"" in with deaf and hoh? I can read and see just fine

What is the purpose of these questions? Is it homework? Research? Avoiding paying accessibility consultants?

1nn5jzx,hardofhearing,"Should I adapt more, or should work adapt too?","Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for some advice and outside perspective.

I’m hard of hearing (deaf in one ear, cochlear implant on the left, and a hearing aid on the right). I’ve been working at the same company for 11 years. From a technical standpoint, I believe I do well at my job—I know my craft, deliver results, and have built a lot of experience.

But I’ve consistently been told I’m “missing the leadership part.” Because of my hearing, meetings and fast-paced discussions are hard for me, and that’s often where leadership and visibility get judged. Recently, my boss suggested I should start considering another position, since my growth has been stalled and so is my salary.

So here’s my question:  
Is it fair to expect that I should completely adapt to the environment, or should it be a two-way effort where the workplace also adapts to me (with accommodations, understanding, etc.)?

I personally believe growth should be a two-party effort—but after 11 years with no real career progression, I’m questioning whether I’m being unrealistic.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

[댓글]
Where do you live? That goes a long way to determining what accommodations your employer is legally obligated to provide.

Are there any accomodations that would allow you to better participate in those meetings? If your career is stalled at this company, why not start applying to others? Unless you want this other position they're asking about.

I’m in a similar situation. I have two Roger table mics, but would need four. The responsible authority just rejected my well written application claiming that ”I should hear 15-20 people”. I asked for more interpreting (right now I get a meeting every other week or so) in December 2023, and still haven’t got it. The application system is complicated and inconvenient for the employer. Just the previous week, I faded to deal with this kind of issues:

* A big event that I actually had interpreters for was moved with short notice, and I lost the opportunity to get to know our new organisation.

* I couldn’t hear a lecture/presentation at that event, but they sent us an… untranscribed voice recording of the presentation.

* I received an uncaptioned video about our new organisation.

* we’re moving to new office space, that is more open than the one we currently have with no good options for where to place me from a hearing perspective.

* We had visitors from abroad, and I wanted interpreters for the lunch. I couldn’t get that, since our interpreters don’t do English. Normally, the booking agency contacts freelancers who are comfortable with English, but we only have a limited number of interpreters who are authorized to access our facilities.

And that’s just the last week. Of course it’s exhausting to just get somehow get the information I need for work. My team is absolutely brilliant, I have a quite good education, so I do get appreciated a lot for my work. Nonetheless, how on earth should we to actually improve communication in a way that makes a difference?

It also doesn’t help that younger generations talk so very fast.

Do you want to progress and take on more leadership?

I tried it and hated dealing with management/HR, so stepped back down to my technical role. 

Companies should accept that some people are happy in their jobs and just let them do the work. The constant need for 'more' doesn't apply to everyone.

1nmqcdk,hardofhearing,The easiest help you can give today,"Hey everyone. First off, I'm sorry if this isn't allowed here. I'm not very versed in Reddit etiquette.

My name is Jason. I've been a carpenter for the past twelve years. I injured my back at work in August 2023 and had to get a spinal fusion. I'm just now getting back to work after blowing through my savings, dealing with complications from the surgery.

At my lowest, I met an amazing girl (Amy) who was also at her lowest. Her husband had died from ALS the year prior and her children were taken away by CPS since she is deaf and unemployed. She was left with nothing, because what was left was taken by the children's grandmother, who now has custody of the kids. 

She was born deaf in China and abandoned as a baby. She was raised in orphanages until she was adopted at the age of 6 by a woman in the US. She's a tiny 4'10"" petite girl with many stories of near abductions and... worse. She's lived a rough life, but she is absolutely amazing on some ""Hear no evil, speak no evil"" type shit. I'm doing everything I can to help her because she deserves it.

So... being deaf and only having a high school education, her options for employment are very limited. She's working with the government program to find a job, but that doesn't seem to be going too well. On top of that, her food stamps got cut. I'm currently supporting her and I can barely support myself right now.

She's incredibly talented and spends all of her free time designing clothing, crocheting, doing hair/makeup/nails, making tutorials videos and editing and uploading to all the socials. She's a hard worker, but she only has 20ish followers. She does her videos with ASL, but she never added any sound, so it would just be quiet and you'd hear a fan or the chair squeaking.

I'm trying to help her with all of this, but I'm just a dumb carpenter with like 12 friends on my socials. I don't know the first thing about gaining followers and I don't really want any... but Amy could really use some. Every follower or view she gets, she comes to me so proud to show me. In my eyes, she's incredibly talented and makes some amazing clothing. --( Possibly NSFW content)-- Check her clothes out on IG @RaverSecrets and her makeup @DeathByMakeup. She's also got TikTok and Pinterest and everything else. Search RaverSecrets and also check out her Shopify store at www.RaverSecrets.com

Please keep the comments clean. Though the clothing is risque and Amy loves modeling it, she is a very sort of sheltered girl. She doesn't do OF or anything and... well, she shows me all the creepy messages she gets from people online and it breaks my heart that she has to deal with that.

TLDR- Deaf girl needs help. Follow @RaverSecrets on Instagram. If anyone wants to collaborate or is local to the DMV, hit me up.

Jason, you’re doing a lot right already. Biggest wins for Amy will be adding captions to every video, posting short clips regularly, and tagging deaf/ASL creator communities so her stuff reaches the right people.

1nmdj5m,hardofhearing,I think I listen to music differently than hearing people,"Hello I wanted to make this post to see if anyone else feels this way? I am male(15), hard of hearing and whenever I listen to music I just can’t make out what the lyrics are. Recently I’ve realized it’s obviously because of my hearing loss. I’ve always connected with more instrumental music and with more of the “vibe” of a song rather than its lyrics. When I listen to music I tend to block out the lyrics and focus on the background music and the instrumental part of songs. My best friend likes to listen to more rap or songs focused around lyrics and when I listen to their songs I can’t ever really tell what is being said because it’s either to fast or the words kinda just mumble together. When I look up the lyrics and memorize them then the words start to form better in my head and I’m able to decipher what was said but without that I have no clue. So I’m just wondering if anyone else connects with more ethereal, indie, spiritual music like I do because of there hearing loss? 

[댓글]
Same, lyrics have always been pretty secondary to me.

My taste in music has definitely changed with the progression of my hearing loss. Also more into instrumental genre. Perhaps what you call ethereal is what vocal trance is to me, with lyrics but the music is what defines the listening experience, not the lyrics.

Yes I have the same problem

Yup me too, listening to music without lyrics even in my native language is hard. However, I enjoy good writing so I always listening while reading lyrics on google because spotify usually don't have the lyrics

Yeah, I’ve never paid attention to lyrics. I’m amazed that people can decipher what’s being said, but like you, I’ve met people who were equally amazed I don’t pay them any attention unless I look them up.

I do tend to listen to a lot of music from different cultures - maybe because it doesn’t bother me that I don’t understand them.

This is exactly the same for me too!

I miss the CDs that came with a lyrics sheet because I loved learning them, following along with those as a kid/ teen. I actually always loved to sing along but didn't always sing actual words for the whole song, sort of just a sound that I heard if that makes sense, I'm embarrassed now lol. I never wore my hearing aides that I was always supposed to wear, as I wasn't forced to, only asked lol. I started to wear them in my 20s. I'm now 40. And still can't really hear a lot of song lyrics. I recently discovered that on Spotify they have a lyrics section that often has the lyrics, or you can add them yourself from a website. I recently started to actually learn The Dead Kennedys lyrics and have fallen in love woth them even more.

Same here, i don’t ‘ hear’ them as part of the song, only the music, unless it’s like a really obvious and catchy chorus.

I was in my 30s before I heard the actual melody of the theme music from *The Price is Right.* Before that, I always thought the melody was in the bass guitar.

I can't hear lyrics either.

I like music that has structure that I can piece together slowly.

I'm very musical person and I can read sheet music and for classical music I will read along and sometimes I will be shocked to see there's an entire extra voice like a quiet flute or xylophone I can't hear at all.  

When I watch music be played live it's the same thing.  I'll see someone playing the flute and only then will I  become aware it's very slightly there in the background.  A hearing person could likely hear it distinctly.

I'm very fond of the music of Steve Reich.  He takes the parts of his compositions and slowly phases them between the instruments and the result is you hear all the parts of the music at different times, slowly changing over time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJWO2FQ16c (feel free to fast forward to about 5 minutes and then 20 minutes if you're the impatient type)

100% same, I never listen to lyrics and go solely on the 'vibe' from the instrumentals + melody. It's particularly funny when I send friends songs and I'm like - oh this is very soothing and mellow... and my friend goes oh its so sad didnt you hear the lyrics??? haha

I started losing my hearing around age 20 (otosclerosis). As a teen I loved lyrics, but as my hearing went the words in most sounds became jibberish and I started leaning towards instrumental music. 


I still listen to folk music and whatever songs have clear lyrics, but most song lyrics are mutilated by my bad hearing and my brain mishearing.

I quit listening to music for several years after I lost part of my hearing because I couldn’t make out the lyrics. About ten years ago, I finally realized I can listen to the music that the words make just like any other musical instrument. 

It was fun trying to guess what the lyrics were. Huey Lewis’ “It’s Hip to Be Square” came through as “If My Hips Could Be Square”.

After all, I enjoy classical music, and opera, even though I don’t understand Italian!

Slightly different experience, but what you said about reading the lyrics and listening to words reminded me. I have had progressive hearing loss due to Meniere's disease, but each time I lose hearing I go back and listen to a playlist of familiar music. Each time I have relearn how words and sounds sound again, and I use familiar songs to do that. Often after an episode of hearing loss I will only be able to pick the song after it's about a third of the way through, like when the chorus kicks in, and then I will tune into it and use my memory to help remap the sounds and words. That said, as my hearing loss has progressed, there are songs that simply don't sound as good anymore. The high frequency samples are gone, or it just sounds flat and disappointing, because I can remember the richness of the sounds that used to be there. So when I lost more hearing in June this year, I immediately asked my partner to buy a subwoofer for our bedroom. We have a 36"" subwoofer in our lounge room, and now I wanted a small sub for the bedroom. If I couldn't hear the high frequencies anymore, at least I can FEEL soul crushing bass, and that can't be taken away !

iOS 26 got it 100% correct, while the older model on iOS 18 had only a \~74.4% accuracy.

If anyone is using a paid captions app, you might find this new default free model from Apple is just as good now as the ""pro captions"" offered from those apps.

I can't say everything in 26 is an upgrade, the new glass UI takes some getting used too for sure, but this seems like a clear improvement.

1nm1959,hardofhearing,Is not getting a hearing aid if you're HOH in only one ear really that bad?,"I've (F 57) recently been diagnosed with “mild-to-moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss”, so I'm half deaf in one ear. 
I have heard it is important to not delay getting hearing aids for        
— the social reasons:  not avoiding activities, not being socially isolated, being able to follow conversations, etc        
— and the brain reasons: keeping the neurones which would receive the signals from the ear stimulated so they don't atrophy or get reallocated,  keeping the brain stimulated in general, thus reducing the chance of cognitive decay and dementia. The lack of social interaction is also a factor in this. 

Well that's what my audiologist says and what I have read online about getting two hearing aids. 

(As is probably obvious by now I'm not an audiologist or other health professional. Apologies if I've used incorrect terminology.)

I have found it difficult to find anything online from a reputable site about the consequences of delaying or not getting a hearing aid when the only significant hearing loss is in one ear for an adult. Almost everything online is about both ears or about children or babies. 

I mentioned my condition and my plan to get a hearing aid to an aunt, Helen (F 82, no blood relation) who has been partly deaf in one ear most of her adult life but never got hearing aids.  She said that the only reason for cognitive delay was missing out of social interaction, rather than the brain not getting stimulated by signals from the affected ear. She also said that since I had one good ear than I'd be fine. 

Hmm. Did what Helen say make any sense?  I suspect her view is based on cognitive dissonance becaise she never got a hearing aid herself. 

Does anyone have any information specifically on the risks of delaying getting a hearing aid when you only have one ear affected?

I have perfect hearing in one ear and moderate to severe hearing loss in the other, getting a hearing aid has helped me thus far. Got one in July. I can definitely tell a big difference when its in or not.

Hearing in stereo is important to me.
It drives me nuts when my name is called and I can't tell by the sound which way to turn.

It made a huge difference for me. I have slight hearing loss in one ear and was mostly deaf in the other (I had surgery to correct it this year). I had to save to buy myself a hearing aid because insurance wouldn't cover the cost since I could still hear fine on one side. About 5 years after I was told I qualified for a hearing aid I finally got one. It wasn't perfect, but I hadn't realized how much I was missing. 


It took a while for me to relearn how to hear on my bad side. It was mentally exhausting and took me a few weeks to adjust to wearing the hearing aid all day without feeling overwhelmed.  Once I adjusted I was very glad to have  better hearing.

No, it‘s not.

If you want to, you can try a hearing aid and see for yourself, if it provides any acoustic advantage for you in daily listening environments. I would even recommend to try one. But if you don‘t want to, that‘s absolutely fine and no risk factor for dementia whatsoever.

I have profound loss in one ear, nearly perfect hearing in the other. I’ve been hard of hearing since 18 months old. I didn’t get hearing aids until my mid 20s and I personally love them. I use a CROS system.

Because of the type of hearing loss I have, my only option for hearing aids was the bone implanted one. I couldn't accept an unnecessary surgery, nor the potential side effects such as my body rejecting the implant. So I choose to live with my deaf ear, and do my best to protect what hearing I have left in my good one. 

I am of the opinion that hearing aids are a personal choice. If you choose to wear them, that's awesome. If you don't, then that's just fine too. I don't have much information about the medical risks of foregoing the hearing aid, unfortunately. But everything in life comes with a risk and we must choose which risks are worth it for ourselves.

Similar situation 47F hoh on one side, no loss on the other. ENT suggested ot was important to get a hearing aid so the ear keeps getting input..i have otosclerosis so maybe that matters. But honestly the little annoyance of the aid is worth it to just hear normally.

It’s never bad to not get a hearing aid.

I needed new hearing aids this year. I actually considered only getting one because I couldn’t hear anything with one ear. So why spend money on two aids if only one helped. My new audiologist told me she could get that ear to hear. She was right! I can actually hear with both ears now. I was and still am amazed.",2025-09-20 15:32:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nm1959/is_not_getting_a_hearing_aid_if_youre_hoh_in_only/

1nlhbl2,hardofhearing,Volume Control,"Volume Control

I (31f) had a translab surgery for an acoustic neuroma back in 2023 which caused me to permanently lose half of my hearing. Since then I've struggled with volume control. I'm always too loud. I've always been a relatively louder person as I came from a loud family and so did my husband, but since my surgery I get told I'm yelling a lot, especially if I'm excited or passionate about something.

How have those of you who are missing half or all of your hearing worked on your volume control so you're not yelling?

TIA 😊

I definitely make a point to work on volume control so that I don't talk loud. Everyone says hard of hearing people talk loud and I don't want to be guilty of that.

I rely on captions apps for school and work. Accuracy of the captions is proportional to the quality of the microphone and internet connection. It also depends on a favorable environment without background noise. The “real time” is a 3-10 second delay.

The cost isn’t scam level like Hearview, but I wonder how cheap it could be without the Ray-Ban name.

It should be mentioned that it only aids in communication one way. It gives the impression that what hearing people have to say is more important than Deaf voices.

Overall, they can be a helpful tool in the right situations, but they are far from giving actual accessibility.

Considering how poorly it performed during the demo I wouldn't hold my breath. Meta isn't good at making products, only buying already successful ones.

The limiting factor is typically the size/positioning of the (wearable) mic tbh. The tech has been there for years on the software end. There's a reason lapel, boom and shotgun mics are still used in film and tv. It's not because people enjoy holding something 6 inches above people's heads or people enjoy getting wired up.

I keep seeing so many different caption-glasses advertised lately. I want it it to be a thing, but just cant imagine its particularly good in the environments you actually need them in. Have they come a long way? Or still an overpriced gimmick for hearing people to play with?

Maybe it’ll help in 10 or so years, well after AI takes all our jobs. I don’t trust a word Zuckerberg says

I’m excited for these eventually working out the kinks; for now they seem to have the same hurdles that frustrate me with my HAs (eg tough to function in loud environments like bars and restaurants, needing to be facing the speaker for background noise reduction to really work, etc). I kind of equate them with the early days of flat screen TVs in terms of price and quality, as with time both improved. Definitely staying tuned though!

*I let my manager know at orientation and he said I’m fine and he will accommodate me if needed. I said I’ll let him know if I have any issues.

I worked drive through for over a decade with hearing aids. The headsets they had when I started did not play nice with the hearing aids I had at the time. It had only one headphone, so I would just take that hearing aid out and crank the headset up, which worked fine. Background noise is always going to be an issue in restaurants. Other people talking, dishes being done and getting slammed around, chatter from cooks, other registers, etc. It sounds like your aids help a lot, but there will be an adjustment period for sure til you get used to what it sounds like. Even the style of building is a factor, whether it's one of those big open rooms or just a normal height ceiling.   

I now work as tech support from home, so every day is packed full of phone calls. I found a solution with over the ear closed back headphones along with a strong headphone amp. The over ear phones don't make my hearing aids feedback, but just plugging them into the PC wasn't loud enough for me, so I started using the headphone amp which is great because I can just adjust the volume knob depending on call quality.  

I think you'll be just fine, but practice nice ways to ask people to repeat themselves, don't just say ""what?"" if you can't hear them.

I worked in retail and in a restaurant and had few issues. As long as I wasn’t making insane requests I was fine. My only limit with the restaurant was “I can’t answer phones with its loud because I’ll never be able to hear it over the customers” which was fine, I got to pick up the slack whenever it was quiet though

Congrats on your new job!! One thing I wish I did when I was younger and in my first few jobs was be transparent with my supervisor and let them know that I was HoH even if I thought I would be fine. 


I also suggest telling coworkers as needed which is what I did. Telling them I was HoH let them know “hey I’m not ignoring you” because I didn’t hear them or that my awkward laugh/chuckle was not because I’m laughing at them it’s because I probably didn’t hear what they said. 

Once I started owning my hearing loss in new environments around new people from the get-go instead of hiding it and pretending nothing was wrong (not saying you aren’t, just using my example), my confidence grew in all areas, not just working in customer service but in developing new friendships in some of those spaces as well.

Some customers are going to be dicks about you not hearing them. Hangry people tend to be ridiculous. 

I hope they won’t be able to get to you

i work in fast food too, at first i’ll admit it was harder, but i learned some things:

 1. memorize the menu board. so many times i can tell what a customer is going to order based off where on the menu they’re looking

2. talk with your hands- people are likely to mirror you, and if they see you moving your hands, they’re likely to make similar movements back. for example, when i ask “for here or for to go?”, i point to the counter/cash (here) or to the door (to go). people many times copy this, although subtle it helps so much. another example is when asking someone if they’d like a ftn drink or bottle, i’ll point to each, or when asking what size, i point to the different sizes we have and 80% of the time they’ll point to the one they’d like (works best if your store have the size options at the front counter)

3. if you’re not sure you got an order right, repeat it back to them when they’re done ordering (useful if you won’t have a screen on the other side so they can’t see) 

i doubt your store has this, but my store has a paper-sized copy of the menu for customers who can’t see very well. however, i’ll use this for when i really have a hard time understanding someone, i’ll have them point to the item they’d like and never had an issue with this

also, let your coworkers know, its important for  communication so they don’t think you’re ignoring them, or in worse case scenario they can help take the order (i’ve only had to do this once or twice, when someone had a thick, heavy accent) and all my coworkers were understanding

 lastly, advocate for yourself!! if someone has a mask, i ask them to lower it down to lipread, or if they’re uncomfortable doing so i ask them to speak clearer if possible. when someone is speaking too quietly, ask them to speak up, or what i do is quite obviously turn up my hearing aids. i know its quite stressful at first, but you’ll get adjusted in no time",2025-09-17 21:58:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njqkiz/have_you_worked_in_fast_food_customer_service/

1njcjzi,hardofhearing,Hearing person here. What might make HoH people struggle with hearing aids?,"Hello! I've been reading the posts here for a while to get some perspective on a problem a family member has been having. This is a question I'm asking in hopes of understanding and seeing if there's any accomodation the family can make to help her, but I know answering these kinds of questions can be exhausting, so please pardon me if I say something insulting or insensitive.

My girlfriend has an aunt who, in her 70s, is now struggling with hearing loss. The family has been able to buy her some hearing aids, but she just doesn't wear them. When asked about them, she just says she ""forgot to charge them"", or ""forgot to wear them"". If we ask her if there's any problem with the aids she answers that ""no, they're perfect!"", but still won't use them.

That wouldn't have been a problem, except that this person already seems to struggle a bit with some form of ADHD or neurodivergence. She lives on her own and takes care of most of her business, but there have been many occasions now in which she misunderstood some crucial information, or in which people have taken advantage of her struggle to comprehend things. The family is also afraid that she's getting some dementia symptons, but at this point, they don't know if it's the age or simply that she's not hearing things right. I think she got used to ""pretending"" she's hearing stuff, because she won't tell us when she doesn't understand things. It's posible she's embarassed about it.

I thought about all of us just learning sign language (LIBRAS, the one we use in Brazil), but I know she would just refuse, saying she's ""too old"" or ""too stupid"" for that. So I was thinking if there's any other way for us to help her keep being able to communicate with friends and family without the hearing aids or the sign language?

Or, if there is no other way, is there some accomodation that might make it easier for her to wear the aids? There's clearly something bothering her about them that she doesn't want to talk about or can't even articulate; is there anything you guys have struggled with that we might help make easier for her?

I ask this because she's clearly my girlfriend's favorite aunt, and it makes her sad that it's getting harder and harder for them to communicate.

1nitlmt,hardofhearing,I regret not wearing ear protection at work,"I never protected my hearing from noise at work because why? It's so uncomfortable. Yeaa and now fuck me.

Half a year ago (im March, to be exact), after a sudden, violent high pitched sound at work my right ear suddenly became ""clogged"". That's how I thought it was. I could hear less and tinnitus appeared. I went to the laryngologist I was wrongly diagnosed but my ears were clean. I only got some B12 vitamin and steroids. Didn't help much.  
I didn't really feel like I could hear less but I had tinnitus which was annoying. The worst part of it is that this ear suddenly became super sensitive to all the sounds, it was unbereable. Listening to music in the car became a nightmare as even at low volume, all the high frequency sounds were like 3x louder painful.  
Also all the sounds become distorted when they're too loud, especially in a closed room with bad accoustic (family dinner during Easter). I'm having trouble understading what is being said because all of the sounds just mix together.

I was an emotional wreck because I did this to myself, I could've easily avoided it by wearing fucking ear plugs or whatever. I went to hospital after almost 2 months after the accident, they told I could've come earlier so I could receive medical treatment and steroids right into the ear. Maybe I could stand the chance to maybe improve my situation, but it was too late and not much could be done.

I regret so much not going to the hospital in the first place and waiting for so much time for nothing. I went through hyperbaric chamber therapy which helped a bit but it was already 2 months late.

Now, the situation is a bit better, tinnitus is kinda bereable, it's not too harsh and it quietens down when I rest, worsens if my hearing is overstimulated. Over sensitivity is also a bit better.

My audiologist told me that both tinnitus and sensitivity would go away on their own (up to one year) but I'm not entirely sure. I'm looking to hear your story or point of view.

Apparently people with hearing loss and tinnitus (which I have) can develop this. I have been experiencing it with loud sounds and music for about 6 months now.

Online it is described as: 

“The Tullio phenomenon (TP) refers to sound-induced dizziness. TP is not a disorder or disease – it is a symptom of an underlying condition.

People with TP experience disequilibrium (unsteadiness), vertigo, nausea, and nystagmus (rapid involuntary eye movements). The symptoms are recurrent, brief and frequently triggered by certain types of noise or changes in middle ear pressure. Trigger sounds include loud sounds, high-pitched voices, and sustained musical notes.”

I get it from the sound of kids screeching while they're playing, or upset. The sound is so much louder than anything else. It makes me feel queasy if it's a short burst of sound, but longer exposure (more than a second, or two) makes me dizzy and very irritable. The symptoms calm down fast once the sound goes away, but I'm still tense and anxious for a bit.

My symptoms don’t seem as severe as what you’ve described, but very high pitched sounds at a very high volume do make me feel dizzy. Especially if they come from the side of my hearing ear.

Yes sometimes. Not really with music. Just some random loud sounds. Like screaming kids, or loud thuds or screeches. I work in a school so these sounds are common enough that I noticed. It can make me nauseous if it’s extended. 

Unfortunately, taking my hearing aids out doesn’t help since the sound waves themselves also trigger this. However turning them off and leaving them in can soften the effects. I also get tinnitus, and get dizzy easily if I turn my head too quickly or flip my hair from a waist bend when blowdrying my hair too so it’s not out of the ordinary :)",2025-09-14 16:18:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ngvgwe/do_you_experience_dizziness_with_loud_sounds_or/

Moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears. For some reason they're showing word recognition scores of around 85% (meaning that you understand words with 85% accuracy when the volume is raised high enough that you can hear it), but to your point I have no idea how they could report that if they didn't actually test with words.

If it helps, an audiogram is basically showing how much sound has to be amplified before your hearing can detect it. What the beeps are is playing a tone at a certain frequency quietly to start, then they gradually increase the volume until you can hear it (press the button or raise your hand or whatever). They test at a range of frequencies (the horizontal axis) and mark how much louder they need to make it before you hear it (the vertical axis). The further down the graph a mark is, the worse your hearing is. Your marks are pretty far down the graph, so your hearing is pretty bad.

My mom has been through the ringer with hearing aids I mean expensive, uncomfortable one some that just sat in a drawer after a week. We all kind of lost hope that she'd ever find one she actually used.

But then, a few weeks back I was reading this blog on medium about hearing aids and it mentioned some of the newer, smaller styles that were supposed to be more comfortable. That got me curious because the prices were less that $100 so I did some digging and we decided to give one a try.

This time it's different. She's wearing everyday, joins in conversation without frustration, and even joked about finally being able to hear the gossip at family dinners again. It's such a relief see her smile instead of struggle. 
I know everyone's experience is different but I thought I'd put this out there in case someone else has been in the same boat. Sometimes the right fit does come along.

So glad you found a solution. 

My mom has worn hearing aids for over 5 years. Just last week she marveled that “these things help you hear, did you know that “

lol. 😉

How bad is your mom’s hearing loss? Mild, moderate, or profound? My mom has profound hearing loss and doesn’t wear the hearing aids she got four years ago because they hurt her ears. While I hate yelling at the top of my lungs, I understand. 

We both have very narrow ear canals, and that little hump on the outer ear where the hearing aids rest is really small, causing her ear canal to hurt and the aids to fall out. I get it because I can’t wear iPods (they fall off immediately) and, even with the smallest inner ear attachment, no matter what ear buds I’ve tried, my ears hurt like hell. I finally found the kind that wrap around the back of your neck, and the sound goes through the bone outside your ear. Perfect!

Mom has an appointment at the audiologist on Monday, so we’ll see what other options there are for her. I need to find her something that works because not hearing can cause depression and cognitive decline. I know she’s unhappy not being able to hear what’s going on around her, not to mention it causes a lot of confusion when she misses half of what we’re telling her. 

So happy for both of you that you found a pair that works! Hopefully, we’ll have good luck next week. 🤞

This is great. Glad it is working out. 

I am interested to see how this would work for me, and I have questions:

Are you in the USA?

Be well, carry on...

I hate not having my hearing aids.  When I was younger I actually went a while without one or both when they died. Loaners weren’t as much of a thing yet.  

Everyone is a little different on the sweating front.  I put my hearing aids in a dryer every time I take them out, so that helps.  I also wipe them off regularly when things get sweaty.",2025-09-12 20:58:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nfeotr/follow_up_to_recent_post/
1nehgue,hardofhearing,Xrai ar2....early reviews?,"Considering getting these but wanted real world experience with the new release...only a couple of weeks in the market so any one using them and dealing with any issues? 

[댓글]
I had issues with their first iteration of Xrai, had to return them. No idea about ar2.

I am currently using Captify.

It's not perfect and not expecting perfection but super fascinating to use them and lots of updates coming up in the future for more QoL.

Currently using my phone and their transcription service daily (due to difficulties hearing different languages) and it is quite nice but pricey. For the XRAI AR2, I pre-ordered on 08/29, they were shipped from a CN (seems China does fab/manufacturing work for most of these high tech products) warehouse and their estimated delivery date is next week 09/21 in the USA west coast. It will probably be like the Even Realities G1 which people have reviewed but with slightly better battery life and brighter screen. But the biggest draw is the no more subscription required ""XRAI Premium Lifetime"" which comes with the classes. On their ""xrai dot com/pricing"" page that would be ""Unlimited normal transcription+ 600 pro minutes / month - for life?"".

  
So with this and physical glasses/battery/hardware seems that it'll be nice deal. Their page hasn't said anything about if it can also let you listen (apologies - audio for hearing capable users) like the Ray Ban Meta. Maybe they will have controls and shortcuts with a customizable app like the G1 glasses - but this is another uncertainty. You might also be locked into the XRAI ecosystem software - but the app, website and listening logs has been really good for me so far. One really clunky thing about the software for the glasses is the AI voice command ""Hey XRAI"" - it is very difficult to pronounce unlike ""Alexa, Siri or Google"". It will probably be a good product for deaf and hard of hearing users, I can confirm as a hearing user that the transcription is pretty accurate in multiple languages (it'll be the same on the glasses as it is on the phone).",2025-09-11 19:03:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nehgue/xrai_ar2early_reviews/
1nedpb1,hardofhearing,What customer service oriented jobs did you do when hard of hearing?,"Im trying to break into the IT industry and customer service experience is required. I'm in my 40's but never worked retail, hospitality, restaurants, etc. I have severe to profound hearing loss and never could imagine myself working in those environments. but my lack of customer experience seems to a blocker to breaking into IT. 

Which customer experience jobs have you had successfully despite having hearing loss?

[댓글]
I’ve worked for the Disneyland Hotel, as a cashier in a grocery store, and as a waitress. Being able to read lips got me through it but the job was obviously easier for coworkers without a hearing disability. I’d personally recommend hotels since it tends to be a quieter environment even when the hotel is insanely busy.

I try to stay away from customer service job.

I haven't worked IT in a long time since switching careers but I don't remember it required much customer service experience. Maybe things have changed since I've been out of the IT game but it was more important to have the right degree and credentials with work experience, and if you lacked work experience you'd need some kind of IT entry level job to start off.

Funnily enough, I started in IT through IT support dept. and that was in the 90s. I didn't have the tools and accessibility that I have right now back then. I think IT support is a solid entry if you'd like to gain some customer service experience as someone who is deaf/HoH. Just make sure you have all the tools you can use as HoH person plus find the right kind of company to allow you the accommodations as a HoH to do your job well.

Hope this helps.

Lots of customer support jobs in tech and probably other industries are email only. I think lots of companies manage all their support tickets through email, or phone support is reserved for a higher tier of service, and if you're new you wouldn't be handling those customers anyway.

If you want to break into tech having tech customer support experience is a good way. Also outbound sales might be another route, kinda spammy and low paying but would be a foot in the door.

I've done medical payment posting and 3rd party returns.  It's customer service from the standpoint of near entry level and interaction with customers/businesses through email but next to no phone calls or face to face customer interaction.",2025-09-11 16:41:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nedpb1/what_customer_service_oriented_jobs_did_you_do/
1ndp4su,hardofhearing,Sign language usage,"How often do you rely on sign language? My daughter has a moderate loss in both ears since birth and has had hearing aids all waking hours since 4 months old. We did baby sign, bought all of the books and took classes as a family. My daughter is now one and is signing much less and seems to prefer saying things like  “ball” instead of signing. She has been pointing and saying mama, up, etc. just wondering if I should continually pursue more advanced sign with her or keep the basics and follow her lead. 

[댓글]
Keep it up because when her hearing aids die,  or in very nosy areas it is a great back up language to know.

As a late deafened/hard of hearing adult, I rely on sign quite a bit. Mostly in mixed environments where I can’t hear what’s going on. I use interpreters at concerts, conventions, and other events. Daily errands, restaurants, and shopping, I rely on other technology (notes). 

I think one or two years is too young to give up on sign language. Your daughter is still absorbing languages and figuring out how they work. Does your family have a Deaf mentor as a language model? PODCs probably have more relevant experience. I’ve never met anyone who regretted learning sign, but I have met a few oral Deaf who wished they learned a lot sooner.

Never, I grew up orally and I don’t know sign language apart from a couple of signs.

Please keep using it. There could be a time when something happens (the hearing aids break or when shes tired of hearing and prefers to communicate by signing or even in worst case scenario when she’s in a situation where she can’t talk, like choking). I sometimes wish my family and I knew sign language. It could prevent a lot of frustration and confusion.

I’m late deafened in my teens. Profoundly Deaf. I sign daily in my home and communicate through interpreters for work meetings. I use a notes apps for errands.

I am part of an early intervention program in my state that offers free sign lessons to families with newly identified deaf/hh babies. In my teaching of sign, I encourage family’s to offer everything and let the child decide what they prefer. However, I also encourage to continue to keep sign as an option. Communication needs get more complex as children grow. It’s helpful to have other options already available if oral only isn’t working.

Keep doing it! When she is in school she can take ASL as her world language credit. She will have a back up of hearing aids are broken or off. She will be able to connect with others in her Deaf community. 

Startasl has asl1 for free online. Then you can buy the materials for 2 3 &amp; 4 to download. It's a great base to go from. There are probably groups in your community where you can go practice.

Your daughter prefers that, because you and other people around her prefer that.

In devastated you’re saying ”rely on”. Sign languages are just like any other language, and don’t hear people saying ”How much do you rely on English” (implied, that they would be terrified if the child would use it).

You really really really need to respect sign languages just like you respect any other language. Children want to use languages that are meaningful and relevant in their lives. They need role models. They need you to care for and love the language.

Many HoH ante forced to live in the hearing world, and only get to understand the importance of signing when things don’t go smoothly in school anymore. It’s not too uncommon to go to community college to learn the sign language before going to college, for example, where I live. The reason being that the young adults want to be able to use interpreters in college. 

Personally, I really value having sign language in my life. It’s a tool, just like any other tool, that makes communication easier and reduces fatigue. When I feel excluded in hearing social groups, I can go to a signing group and regain energy, that I need for the everyday life among the hearing.

I wish I and others around me knew more signing. What we know we use a fair bit at times, it's just easier on me.

Options are wonderful. Keep doing both and let her lead the way until she tells you her preference herself.

Most of my daily life doesn't not involve sign but I'm glad I know some.",2025-09-10 20:18:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ndp4su/sign_language_usage/

1nddjzn,hardofhearing,Hearing Aid Question,"I'm 15F, and I got my hearing aid roughly 5 months ago. I have only one hearing aid in my left ear, because my left ear canal is abnormally small. I basically don't have an eardrum. I don't have it on as I'm typing, and I can't hear the keyboard. My right ear is better, but it is also declining.

I recently got back from Florida, as I was on vacation. But, on the drive home, my hearing aid stops working. I have an Oticon Play PX, by the way. I had it on during the flight, and of course I experienced pressure. I don't know if that's a cause or something.I did get water in my ears during the trip, but I didn't wear my hearing aid in the pool (I know it's not waterproof).

I also am wondering if it's the humidity from florida. I also have really waxy ears, and I don't know if its that. I have changed the dome/wax filter MULTIPLE times yesterday. I just want to know if anyone has ideas. I'm so lost. Thank you so much!

I think it's an easy fix but hard to diagnose without seeing it. Can you take it in to your audiologist?

Do you have a dryer box? Either an electronic one of a sealed box with a packet of desiccant in it? You could take the battery out and store it for 24 hours to see if that helps.

Also try a new packet of batteries, if it uses them. Maybe the pack you have has gone bad.

1nd9i69,hardofhearing,Doctor with extremely thick accent,"I have moderate-to-severe hearing loss. I’m finally getting hearing aids. They arrive at the end of the month.

I’m being assessed for memory loss. The doctor has a **very thick** Israeli accent. I just want to cry when dealing with him. I can’t understand a word he says. His report says I have receptive language deficits (duh, because I’m deaf. I had to keep asking him to repeat himself) and there’s some question of hearing problems (uhhh, there’s no question. It’s there in my chart).

I’m trying to transfer my care to another doctor in the memory clinic in the medical system I belong to, but he has to approve it. He refuses!!! I’ve explained that I’m hard of hearing, I have a very difficult time understanding foreign accents, and this is an accessibility issue. I’ve escalated this to the clinic manager and managed care (Medicare Advantage, which is an HMO). I said if I can’t change doctors, I’ll have to terminate the assessment. I’m at a total loss.

When the nurse told me this, she asked if my kids could come to the appt and help me out. I said my son works nights at the warehouse, and he sleeps during the day. My daughter works full time. I asked if the nurse could be in the room and “translate” for me. She said she couldn’t do that.

Can anyone advise me?

Slap 'em with an ADA lawsuit. Being able to understand what is being said is a reasonable accomodation.

Get a lawyer.

You can’t understand him because of your deafness. Demand real time captions for your next appointment. Get an IP relay number to make calls.  Make them accommodate you. IMO, you should stop bringing his accent into this. Just say you need CART for every appointment. Let the CART stenographer handle his and every other doctor’s accent. 

Getting a lawyer to file a suit citing the ADA is much easier said than done. It’s one of those prices of internet advice that everyone says even though very few people have experience with it.

I asked a similar question in a deaf group several years ago, and jeez! The hate comments I got!! Equating not being able to understand foreign accents with racism, I guess. In a deaf group!!!!

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Getting a lawyer might be the best option to get this moving.

I have a disabled 38yo son (autism, ADHD, Tourette’s, bipolar), snd I have a BUNCH of serious medical issues myself, so I’m very good at rattling cages, but this one has me a bit flummoxed. Well, today I have to send a letter to work on another issue. Another doctor in the group who needs a good slapping.

Most of my doctors at this medical facility (a university medical school and a Level 1 trauma hospital) are good-to-outstanding, and there are a few I want to clone and make a medical practice out of. I just have 2 God-complex doctors I’m dealing with. Well, I’m loaded for bear and am not backing down.

I’ve exceeded my daily allowance of cliches. LOL

As a training SLP I have to let you know receptive language difficulties are very different from hearing difficulties. Receptive language means you're ability to understand words, not you're ability to hear them! Someone with receptive language difficulties will also have trouble understanding written words for example, it's an issue with the way language is processed in the brain. Being hard of hearing can, but doesn't necessarily, impact your ability to process language. This doctor sounds pretty rubbish... hope you can find a better one soon

Same thing. I don't get foreign accents, people with those weirdly huge mustaches that cover the lips, and children and some women with high pitched voices.

I soft sell the accent. People get touchy about it, presumably like this bozo.

I would threaten a lawyer first.  Maybe ask the clinic admin if they know a good ADA lawyer and if they have the number for the local medical licensing board.  If they ask you why, tell them you tried being nice and it's no longer that time.  Then, if nothing changes, do a consultation with a lawyer.  As always, be sure to document the when, who, and what of all conversations.   Also, emails are good.  You could also start recording the appointments.  It might make them uncomfortable enough to approve a change of Dr.  At least you will have evidence that you are simply trying to get care.

Is there a different company you can use in the area who can take over your care?

Tell the clinic manager *in writing*:

&gt;

If they refuse, go straight to your insurance’s **ADA coordinator** or file a complaint with **HHS OCR**.

Key: use the phrases **“ADA,” “reasonable accommodation,” and “effective communication.”** Those trigger legal obligations.

I’m not even deaf or hard of hearing, but trying to understand someone with an accent is brutal. My kids are hard of hearing and I always think of them when I have to talk to someone with thick accent. Makes me sad 😔

Contact the patient advocate, if there is one.

I'm going the same thing. My doctor doesn't speak clear English. I called and requested a doctor change. For someone that can speak clear English because I can't understand my current doctor. I struggle understanding her, she's Asian.  I've contacted and spoke to different people about getting a different doctor and I'm getting absolutely nowhere. According to them you only get to change doctor's twice. I only remember doing it once. It's now a company rule, it's just between the doctors. I told the head person that was the only person that could help me. I have nobody to go with me. My husband with his work hours can't go with me. I need to go but can't because they are no help to me at all. I haven't gone since March, and I just can't get my needs addressed. It's frustrating!

I also have a son with Down's Syndrome. He has hearing issues and speech issues. I have to be there for him but with my hearing loss, it's easier said than done.

What state are you in?

Does your state have a Disability Law Office? In my state they offer legal assistance at no cost. They can step in to mediate and advocate on your behalf. They are more likely to take your case if you are not seeking a law suit but simple assistance exercising your right to communication access.

Ask how are the deaf assessed for memory loss? Look up an answer on Google before an appointment so you if they are giving a line pf BS.",2025-09-10 09:27:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nd9i69/doctor_with_extremely_thick_accent/
1ncoq6e,hardofhearing,Gas cooking safety,"Hi there! 

Half deaf since birth, I'm 52 now and have ME.

the illness ace the deafness is making me much more likely to leave the gas cooker on. I can't hear it. 

I left the gas on all night recently, when it wasn't lit. The windows were open and I think they prevented the gas from building up but the smell was very strong and frightening. 

I also leave the hob on because I can't see it in the daylight and can't hear it. 

I've flooded downstairs twice but taught myself not to leave the tap running anymore. However with cooking, I seem to be forgetting to turn it off. 

Has anyone got any tips? If I set an alarm on my phone, I won't hear my phone unless I'm in the same room as it. I don't have WiFi so can't use Alexa for cooking timing. However I'm thinking what I should do is have an old fashioned egg timer and wear it round my neck. It's not very sexy but might have to do. 

But if anyone else has got ideas I would love to hear them. I live in a rented property so not sure what tools there are I can use. I've written to RNID to see if they can suggest anything. 

I try to always check the knobs after cooking and physically make sure each one of them is off. But whenever I do forget, I do seem to be leaving the hob on. :'-( 

I don't want my flatmates to get upset with me, it's natural for them to be concerned and I don't want to be a problem!

I have a light on my vent fan above the stove. I turn it on when cooking so I know when the light is on, either the stove or oven is also on and needs turned off. I havent left the stove on for an extended period of time but I have forgotten that I turned the oven on.

I use my Apple Watch timer for some things like this. For example, I’ll set a timer for the water to boil bc I won’t hear it and in the past I’ve boiled it down to nothing.

Oh my goodness, I've got a smart watch so I can do this! I have been forgetting to wear it so I'm going to try that thank you very much x",2025-09-09 17:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ncoq6e/gas_cooking_safety/
1nc1pkc,hardofhearing,Experiences with TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR Glasses (or Other Options) for Real-Time Captions in Healthcare Settings?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a healthcare professional with severe hearing loss (HoH). I’m looking for a practical and reliable way to get real-time captions for conversations with patients, coworkers, and in professional meetings.
I’ve been researching:
* TranscribeGlass T1
* XRAI AR 

A few questions for those who’ve tried them (or similar setups):
1. How accurate and reliable are captions in real-life noisy environments (like a pharmacy, hospital, or clinic)?
2. Which setup is more practical for all-day professional use? (comfort, battery life, charging while in use, ease of setup)
3. Has anyone compared the captioning accuracy of TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR?
4. Any major downsides or frustrations I should know about before investing?
5. Are there other captioning glasses you’d recommend that are better suited for healthcare workers who need quick, accurate communication with patients?

I’d love to hear from anyone—especially healthcare workers—who uses these devices daily. Your real-world experiences will help me decide which setup to invest in.

Thanks in advance!

You can test out the captioning for the XRAI AR2 without the glasses by downloading the XRAI Glass app. XRAI supports lots of different AI providers including the cloud and on-device so it's much more versatile. It can also run in your hospital's own cloud, if available.",2025-09-08 22:19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nc1pkc/experiences_with_transcribeglass_vs_xrai_ar/
1nbvhba,hardofhearing,Should I Report being HoH to HR?,"Not sure if this belongs here or in another forum, but basically I am hard of hearing but without an official diagnosis. I was profoundly deaf as a small child due to illness. Around 5/6 I had ear tubes put in so I can hear again, with the caveat that very low or very high sounds I just can't hear. I went to an ENT a few years ago and was tested, but all they said was I am 'borderline'. 
This is affecting me in my job because we have a few people who talk really low but also really quietly. Not a week goes by that I'm not reminding them I can't hear them or asking them to repeat themselves. And I was late for a meeting because they changed the location 9 minutes before and I didn't hear the notification on my phone because I'm up and moving around. 
So my question is should I go to HR about this without an official diagnosis? I'm not even sure that they may do, just to cover myself from potential backlash. Thoughts? 

[댓글]
At this stage, see a doctor again explain the difficulty. Get a new hearing test. They'll provide you with documentation that your now diagnosed with hearing loss to provide to work. They may need to make reasonable accomodations for you.

I’d definitely recommend getting a hearing test (Costco does them for free, if that’s an option for you, and they won’t do the super annoying push for crazy expensive hearing aids that you’ll get elsewhere) and get a printout of your results, *then* go to HR. But don’t put it off.

My answer only applies if you are in the US and requesting reasonable accommodations under the ADA. I don't know how it works in other countries.

I just went through the process in the US. There is a form that your audiologist fills out that specifies how your abilities are impaired and what reasonable accommodations they think you should be offered.

Because of this, unless you have an audiologist willing to fill out the form, there's really no point in telling HR, they won't be able to do anything.

I recommend seeing an audiologist (not an ENT) to get a hearing test and then ask if they would be willing to fill out the ADA form for you. 

You also need to know what ""reasonable accommodations"" you are requesting. ""Cover yourself from backlash"" is not an accommodation. Being late for meetings is not an accommodation (although being late because the meeting location changed at the last minute is a problem that isn't disability specific.) Asking for information to be conveyed through text, asking for captions for video calls, those are reasonable accommodations. 

https://askjan.org/ has good information about what to ask for.

If you are in the US you would be protected and accommodated under the ADA but only if you self report to HR.

Additionally, if you are in the US you can get support from your state’s vocational rehab office. Every state has one but the name, funding, and services offered will vary. My state offers free college tuition, audiological exams, job training, job placement assistance, assistance in identifying accommodations, and sometimes they even pay for hearing aids. But you need to open a case and ask. These services are not advertised but are there for you.

No I would not disclose at this point. Try and find work arounds. One on my co-workers could not hear very well. She put a small mirror on her cubicle in front of her so she could see was behind her

[askjan.org](https://askjan.org)

I disclose my hearing loss but I don't leave it up to them to come up with solutions. I come with knowledge and resources. This shows I can manage hearing loss just fine. That said, I'm well educated at long last so I know my technology, what works and what doesn't. I can explain why hearing aids aren't called hearing miracles for a reason and why I need this, or that. Most of it is small accommodations. Between my hearing aids, lipreading strategies and introducing accommodations, I do fairly well. (Accommodations  usually help others too. Most people hide their hearing loss.)

It is hard to lead the way through. That's the difficult part. 

I'd also rather people know I can't hear rather than assume I'm stuck up or dense. 

If you don't have one already, get a smartwatch to help with help phone alerts...if you're talking about missing a text. That's helped me a lot.",2025-09-08 18:19:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nbvhba/should_i_report_being_hoh_to_hr/

1nb64oq,hardofhearing,HOH and pregnant,"Does anyone have any recommendations for when you're asleep with a baby? I'm panicking as I am due at the beginning of October with my first child, but I don't know what to do about when I'm asleep and baby starts crying. I wear hearing aids during the day and take them out at night, which means that I don't wake up to noises in the night. It puts a lot of pressure on my partner to wake up if baby is crying and I don't think it's fair that he will end up suffering from reduced/interrupted sleep in order to wake me up. I have a Samsung watch I use the vibration for wake up alarms in the morning. Is there something that can be paired with this?

[댓글]
My wife has no issue giving me the wake up slap letting me know it’s my turn to tend to baby in the middle of the night. 

We also have a leap frog baby camera which has a sound detection mode. In this mode, when it detects sound it will give a couple louder beeps.

Father to a one year old here. I got a bed shaker - there's a sensor under his crib that transmits to a little puck under my pillow that vibrates when he cries. Works great. Let me know if you're interested and I can dig up the make and model (wasn't cheap, I think like $150 for the full setup). I tried a smart watch but the vibration wasn't powerful enough to wake me up reliably.

Honestly.. just let your partner wake you up. I'm sure they would be getting woken up by the baby crying anyway. 

One thing I would suggest is set alarms for every 2-4 hrs at night to feed.. but some babies dont wake up as often to feed so you might just be waking for no reason.

I’m gonna get down voted and I don’t care. Take your hearing aides out and rest. Your partner will be okay they didn’t just grow a baby inside of them for 9 months and then give birth. My husband did all the night feedings after I broke down from the post partum depression that onset after my son was born. It was rough. Instead of trying to do it all because your sense of fair is off, take the rest guilt free.

Hard of hearing here - I slept with my baby in her room. Never an issue. They do have vibration devices that will wake you up, so look into those.

All my kids have slept in my room (if not in my bed) so it’s never been an issue. But our baby monitor also has a vibration function. It’s an undvika from IKEA and was unfortunately recently discontinued but is still available in some stores and with some online orders. 

If baby wakes up it’s likely going to wake up both of y’all anyway unless you sleep in different rooms, your partner can also easily wake you up then go back to bed, but I would highly recommend sharing duties.

Set your alarm regardless of whether your partner gets up with you. I had to feed both my babies every 2 hours at first due to weight issues. They often were not crying at the two hour mark and I woke them to feed so I set an alarm all night long. 

But I also agree with the comments that support your partner waking you. It’s hard to know how things will go once the baby is here and you may need your partner awake with you anyway. I did not want to, but ended up needing to exclusively pump with both babies so my husband gets up with me every time and he changes and feeds the baby while I pump. It has bonded us all even more so as a family. Everyone’s sleep is going to suffer whether you like it or not and the baby is just as much your partners responsibility as yours.

I feel like this brings up the more general issue of how significant others play different role for a partner that is HOH or deaf, than they would otherwise. 

  
My best friend is a bit of a diva and tells her husband, ""You knew I would cost you money when you married me!"" While this is in jest, of course, there is some truth to knowing you will play a role in your spouse's/chidrens' lives that might look a little different. One that you signed up for. 

  
I have a husband and 2 kids that are hard of hearing. All live in my house right now and indeed, I am called on to do things for them that isn't maybe the norm. Do I need to wake up my 20-something kids to make sure they wake up in time for work/class? Yes, sometimes it's helpful/necessary. Do I make phone calls for them, schedule appointments, relay what was missed? Absolutely. Because I love them.

There are ways to cosleep safely. And if you cosleep your baby is so close to you that when they start stirring you notice it before they start crying. Their movements wake you up. Then if you can, you can just breastfeed in bed without getting up. For us, everybody got more sleep that way.

I’d recommend checking out [this monitor](https://www.hellobaby-monitor.com/products/hellobaby-video-monitor-with-5display-pan-tilt-zoom-video-baby-camera-no-wifi-night-vision-temperature-lullabies?variant=46443335188647&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22058489442&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAomAnzKbAL7MbXlqmALTETjmQ63lC&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_fnFBhB0EiwAH_MfZhqKk4g8z8qBuAGJ0vtzgCjGc6AUq3wdPbisSa597nBXt_CQJKbqmhoCFlkQAvD_BwE)

This monitor has an Eco-Mode setting so it dims the screen when it’s quiet but then the camera turns on when it picks up sound. This could be a great idea to have and when the camera turns on you know it’s picking up on your baby crying!

7 weeks postpartum and HOH. Honestly I’ve happily surprised myself that I do wake up when my baby starts to stir/cry at night. I was also nervous about this as I tend to also be a deep sleeper, but I guess mom instincts have kicked in. The first few days I think my husband had to shake me awake a few times to tend to baby but now I think my sleep patterns have adjusted.

1nafgy4,hardofhearing,requesting interpreter/disability accommodations at a theater,"i found out i was HoH last november and since about january, have been using hearing aids. i currently use jabra power BTEs and have been learning ASL for a year now. even though i am in the mild-moderately severe loss range (cookie bite shape), i really have been struggling hard with hearing people with and without my aids, of course its better with though. i have found regardless that i prefer to use asl and my bf is learning now as well. i’m not fully fluent yet in ASL but i’ve been learning at my college and frequently use it with my partner day to day (mostly bc i prefer using it over speaking and hearing but also bc we’re both learning so good practice!) as well as attend Deaf community and ASL club events frequently!

i have been looking into tickets for twilight in concert to go to with my bf. CONTEXT: this is where u go to a concert hall, theater (not movie theater) and they play the movie while having an orchestra to do all the music live. we're both musicians and twilight is one of my favorite movie series so its a win-win! 

there are not a lot of tickets left in the theater near us but the only seats left are in the very back rows of the upper balcony. there are still some accommodation seats (not just ones for ppl w mobility issues) left though. i have been considering calling the theater to maybe request an interpreter. while i *can* hear with my hearing aids, it isn't the best even still and i will not be able to hear the movie/music from the very back without any captioning or interpreter. i will still be able to enjoy the music by watching and listening but the speaking portions i will struggle with. i don't want to take any seats away from disabled people who NEED NEED these spots but i am wondering if this could be a good option. i am in asl 3, can hold conversations and am very good at picking up signs i don't yet know with context so it's not like this would go completely unused. i know the twilight script like the back of my hand but if there are things i miss, it'd be nice to have something in front of me. i always use captioning devices at the movies as well. 

would it be wrong for me to call for the accommodations and seats? would i be taking this away from someone else?

Never be afraid to ask for what you need. The worst that can happen is they will say no.

In my experience, movie theaters all have closed caption devices available. They don't always work, but they are available.

OP, you are deaf/hard of hearing. You know ASL. You have the right to an interpreter. You’ve already emailed. You should call the theater box office on Monday (IME, they are well versed with relay calls). Ask what your options are. They will be required to caption the movie or provide interpreters. If the movie is already open captioned, great! If not, they will provide interpreters. When it’s time to buy the tickets, they should cost balcony prices, but you will probably be moved to orchestra left or right. 

Let the theater, event manager, and interpreters work out all those details. You just need to enjoy the show.

Those seats are designed for physical accessibility for those with service dogs and/or mobility aids. 

They may already have an ASL translator set up for the event and a way for you to see them from any seat. 

Actual theaters meant for stage plays or musical events tend to have excellent acoustics and sound systems to make it easier to hear performers.

I am confused, what do you mean by NEED NEED? I also have a cookie bite hearing loss, but mine is solidly moderate and I actually can't wear my HA to movies/concerts because they intentionally make it loud to the point of being loud enough to damage hearing. Are you saying you don't need accommodation really, but it would be convenient if it meant better seats?

Those seats are typically physical/mobility for people with mobility aids or the seeing eye dogs so they can get up.

If it's opera they usually have subtitles at most modern performances. They may have some caption device available or can use your phone.

edit: Wait it's twilight in concert? You'll be able to hear the orchestra regardless of where youre sitting. You may need earplugs honestly.

And provided the film's not edited, you can lit download the subtitles to twilight and sync it on your phone or something. It's a popular film.

Even if you “just have clogged ears” a professional can clean them safely improving the quality of hearings. Make sure you’re being careful with your exposure to sound. You don’t want to damage your hearing.

It's definitely worth getting checked - basic hearing tests are non-invasive and easy, and they'll be able to tell you if you have earwax or a more long-term issue.

You don't say which country you're in but you spell British, so if you're in the UK then Boots and Specsavers do free quick hearing tests too - that was enough to tell me I needed a more serious investigation.

You could probably do a test online for free or find an app to do it

Ask a parent your your legal guardian to take you to an ENT. Get it checked out.

Don't play guitar with headphones its a recipe for disaster. Can you get a marshall microamp (the belt amp) or something? Maybe practice at school? A lot of musicians wear earplugs.

Of course you should get it checked out! If it’s ear vax, they’ll fix it in two minutes. If it’s other kind of heating loss, you’ll need to adapt to that.",2025-09-06 21:40:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nabmpd/should_i_get_checked/

[댓글]
ALL THE TIME! Sorry was that too loud?! My aids broke at the end of July and I can't get in to get new ones until the end of September...

Why are we always accommodating hearing people? Shouldn't it be the other way around?

I traumatize them back. “Oh, am I speaking too loud? Sorry, it’s due to my LIFE LONG EXISTENCE AS A MEMBET OF THE DEAF COMMUNITY YOU FUCKING PINECONE” 

I get so heated about this, it is SO demeaning

I rarely get this because I hear myself so much through bone conduction and more or less lost my hearing AFTER I'd already learned how to speak and at what volume. I grew up with a step father who could hear a fart from china and learned early on to regulate my speech, walk gently if I didn't want to get caught late night snacking. Please don't read this as I had a bad stepfather, he was and still is a very good man. But in a strange way, I was trained without even knowing I had a hearing problem.

I’m hyper conscious of talking too loud so my husband always tells me to speak up. We can’t win.

I mean... I've been told I'm talking too loudly and I just... Talk less loud? Being hard of hearing doesn't mean you can't learn to adapt. It's not ""catering to hearing people,"" it's being a considerate human. Some people have sensory issues and loud voices in close proximity can be uncomfortable or even painful. Other people just don't want someone shouting in their ear- it hurts.

If they're not being an ass about it, there's no reason to take it personally when someone asks you to lower your voice when you're too loud.

Yup me too. I’m HoH, and I’m always told to lower my volume. And hearing people don’t want to repeat themselves if I didn’t hear them… love that!

I always get told I don't speak loud enough. because I can hear myself and I feel like hearing myself means I'm yelling. its just no winning so sometimes I don't talk and just use sign language.

I didn't realize how ableist this was until I met other people with hearing loss in college. My (hearing) mom would tell me this constantly growing up even when other people thought I wasn't being that loud. She basically used this as a way to shut me up whenever I got too excitable as a kid. 

I lost my hearing when I was two and I'm the only deaf person in my family. There isn't much of Deaf community where I live -- not even a school for the Deaf in my state. Then I went to Gallaudet and realized just how bad things were for me.

i’m excited to move into our new house just because i can yap as loud as i want without annoying neighbors

I’m sorry I can’t hear you with your hand over your mouth and my insurance doesn’t cover hearing aids. 🤷🏻

1n93k0y,hardofhearing,BAHA hearing aid,"Hi, I wondered if anyone could help or offer advice. My Nan has had the BAHA surgery and has the BAHA connect but when she wears it she gets really loud screeching feedback whenever she sits back on her chair and it touches the back of it and when she touches it so now she refuses to wear it. 
Seems such a shame that she’s been through the surgery for it to be so crap. 

Any advice would be really appreciated 

[댓글]
unfortunately feedback with the BAHA when something presses against it (chair, hats, touching it, etc) is going to happen. She just has to adapt and keep things from pressing against it. I wish there was something different she could do, but unfortunately that's just the price to pay to hear! hopefully, besides the feedback, she's receiving good benefits from her BAHA!

I experience the same thing with my Cochlear America Osia. To keep it from happening, I place a small pillow behind my head and off to one side away from the sound processor. This keeps the sound processor from touching the headrest on my chair. 

Hopefully, her chair will accommodate something like that.

Thanks for your reply. 
She sees no benefit to it than what her hearing aids give her so she won’t wear it now unfortunately because she can’t sit back and rest her head back on the sofa without it screeching. Seems like a bad design. Hopefully they fix it

The feedback is because the sound generated is being picked up by the microphone, I have the same issue if I lay in bed with mine on. I stream audio from my phone when laying down before bed. As I don’t need to hear I’ll just turn off the microphone and the feedback goes away. Other times say I wanna wear a winter hat feedback is an issue. I’ll turn off the aid microphone and use live listening on my phone the audio picked up on my phone will play in my “ears”. I actually have an accessory microphone that can clip to my shirt but I almost never have it when I need it. I always have my phone with live listen on my phone.

1n5jms6,hardofhearing,Do/did you feel like an imposter when being diagnosed?,"I've known I had an audio processing disorder since I was a little kid but I only recently learned that I was supposed to have hearing aids for it since I was a kid. I knew I lip-read a little but I always just thought that was normal or asking someone to repeat something multiple times constantly throughout the day.

I'm told I'm considered HOH because of it but I honestly feel like I'm an imposter because of it. I have other disabilities that I've just accepted but for some reason this, this feels like I'm lying, like I'm somehow ""taking someone else's spot"" or something. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has/is going through the same thing?

[댓글]
I was born hard of hearing. I was sick a *lot* when I was a kid, constant ear infections. I've never known anything else. And yet I *still* get people saying I'm faking it because sometimes I *do* hear things I normally wouldn't. Makes me feel terrible.

Hey there!!! I have APD and call myself HoH. 
I developed APD due to my CMT1E. 
I wasn't aware that hearing aid's help, thats cool and I will be bringing this up to my audiologist in November. 
You can call yourself whatever you wish. I believe we are HoH because since my brain cannot translate sounds into words sometimes, so I don't always recognize I'm being spoken to.
And in loud environments?  Forget about hearing correctly at all. Bar life is the worst for me. 🥲

I feel like a bit the same at the beginning... Which type of hearing aids do you have?

It's the same for me. I don't lip read, or need hearing aids, but have to ask people to repeat stuff a bunch and have to use subtitles and look up lyrics because I can't make them out. I haven't learned ASL or anything either. I also very much feel like an impostor, probably because I don't use hearing aids or lip read or use ASL and while I'm hard of hearing I'm not deaf and those terms are often linked in terms of implications; I can still hear the sounds, I just can't process them sometimes.

Not at all. You need to make people aware of it. I wear a big badge at work that says ""Hearing impaired, please speak slowly and clearly"" to try and encourage other people to make the accommodation for me (I'm a public librarian). 

The problem is that they rarely make that accommodation, even with me going out of my way to say that I'm HOH (I use hearing aids and rely on lip reading in noisy environments) . This goes both for my employer and the public, so lord knows what it would be like if I didn't try and make my requirements clear. 

So yes, make sure people know what your needs are, but don't expect them to behave any differently! Sorry!

Definitely see an audiologist when you can. Hearing aids have made a world of difference with my CAPD. I've had it for 19 years after a head injury and I also did not know that hearing aids were a thing for it until very recently.

I will say that I don't feel like an imposter because I got diagnosed at a children's hospital after intensive testing for weeks and I clearly struggle to understand others and communicate with them and anything other than the most ideal environment with me facing them. So I've never really had to deal with that specific part of the struggle.

I also call myself hard of hearing because there's no other way to really explain what's happening in public

1n3jh7e,hardofhearing,My mom is losing her hearing… and now she’s losing her life too,"I feel like I’m watching my mom fade away in real time. She’s losing her hearing, and it’s not just about sound it’s stealing everything from her.

She barely eats at all now because she feels uncomfortable sitting at the table and not being included in the conversation. She's no longer answering the phone because she can't keep up. She enjoyed music, TV, even church now it just makes her upset. It is as if the world is passing her by and getting on with it while she remains fixed in silence.

The part that terrifies me? She told me she doesn’t see the point of living like this. She actually said she’d rather be gone than live completely shut out. That crushed me.

We’ve tried doctors, hearing aids, support groups, even writing things down for her but nothing has truly helped. Every day she pulls away more, avoids people, eats less, and just… disappears a little.

I don't know what to do with her anymore. Has anybody else ever been through that with a parent? What actually worked before it was too late?

[댓글]
Why did hearing aids not work? 
Also consider the possibility that losing her hearing is just part of a bigger problem that comes with age (seeing friends pass, losing mobility and independence, facing mortality,  etc)

Not with a parent but I am going through this myself (30s). Yeah it's a struggle not to end it sometimes. 

Hearing aids don't work for me. Maybe they would for her, but they are a learning curve too and a constant reminder that you're disabled. Writing things down does help but she might be embarrassed you're going to the trouble. I guess just be aware that everything she used to love and do effortlessly is difficult and embarrassing now. It really is a difficult position and I love that you're making an effort.

As another commenter said little things can help. Try 1:1 conversations in quiet rooms with good lighting and caption software (most smartphones have this as a default utility now). Do things that rely on visuals over sound or just being together without sound. Don't let her feel like you're moving on without her.

Reminds me of a quote I’ve seen attributed to Hellen Keller: “Blindness cuts you off from things, deafness cuts you off from people”
And I can relate to this so much in my own life.

I have never tried them myself, and I would assume they work best with 1 on 1 conversations rather than a dinner table full, but maybe it wouldn't hurt to try hearview caption glasses.

Get her a tablet, and teach her how to use the live transcribe of people talking. Give her a pad and a white board and people can write on that with her as 1-2-1 chats. Or they can use the tablet and tasker l tablet pen. You can tell the tablet to stay on that screen so it's easier for her to use..
Show her that it's ok to raise her hand to speak or every one will go quite and be patient to hear what she has to say so that there's time and gaps for her to keep up.

This is exactly what happened to my granddad and why I created these: https://xrai.glass/ar2

The best lip reading aid that I know of is cued speech. There are some training videos on YouTube if you’re interested. The good news is that your mother only needs to learn how to read it and you only need to learn how to project it.

She needs professional support. The health care in my country has psychologists and counselors that support people with sudden or progressive deafness. Why haven’t you started learning sign language to include her at the dinner table? Be creative. You don’t have to do everything just using speech. Find more ways to communicate. Write, use microphones, transcription apps or order live captioning. But you really should learn to sign. Prioritize that, and stop making excuses. It’s possible. 

Get support from the health care system, and other groups for late deafened.

Being 73, I’m starting to experience what she has been going through for years. When your hearing starts to go , you misunderstand what people are saying and when you join in the conversation, it becomes apparent very quickly that you misheard what was said. It is such an embarrassing situation, that you eventually stop taking part in the conversations and then you stop going out in public at all. I tried the hearing aids advertised on TV, Miracle Ear, Beltone, etc., and they were no help. I finally went to an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor that specialized in hearing loss problems. I ended up with a Phonak in one ear and a Cochlear bone implant for the other. I now hear most of what I was missing. The doctor was able to determine that my hearing loss was a normal loss of high frequency sound in the right ear with a 60% loss of sound in the left ear coupled with a 100% loss of speech comprehension in the left ear. The bone implant hearing aid now sends all sound on my left side to both the left ear and the right ear, and I hear it in my right ear with 100% comprehension. 

If you haven’t taken her to an actual ENT doctor, that may be why nothing is working.",2025-08-29 21:15:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n3jh7e/my_mom_is_losing_her_hearing_and_now_shes_losing/

I'm in the US, and when I went to the UK for university there, it took 2-3 weeks before something clicked and I could read lips again. I can now tell if someone has a UK/Irish/Australian accent when the TV is muted just by lip reading.

If you use lip reading, it may be part of why accents are challenging; the way people form their words helps generate their accent. And I feel like some accents/regions barely move their lips at all. If you work consistently with a population, consider watching some shows and focus on lip reading to possibly build more familiarity and make that mental connection. Otherwise, it's fine to explain that you have trouble hearing/understanding and ask them to slow down or enunciate more.

I have this same problem, so I am just honest and tell them I'm DHH and have difficulty hearing and we try again and again (or write it down, type it, etc)

I see that you said you already explain you are hard of hearing, but if I am ever in the situation with someone who has an accent and I’m asking them to repeat more than usual, I will say something along the lines of, “Hey, I am sorry I’ve asked you to repeat yourself so much. I have hearing loss. This makes me mishear things very easily, it’s not your fault, it’s mine. Please try and bear with me”  Because usually if someone is offended, they may be just self conscious of their English being well-understood. If you shift the blame more towards yourself (even though having hearing loss isn’t really your FAULT) it takes it off of them feeling upset/self conscious, and usually they will be more understanding. If they want to ask questions about it, I usually will let them and will answer their questions. 

If THEY bring up at some point something about their accent making it harder for me to hear/understand them, I still try and make them understand that it’s not really their accent/their English making the difference, it’s just because when I am listening to anyone talk, I fill in missed parts with what makes sense in context, and sometimes parts of their accents can sound like different things to me when I mishear. 

Basically, I try and assure them that themselves/their accent is not the problem, and that I just struggle with hearing/understanding people well and mishearing more than the average person. 

I am sorry that it seems that people are not understanding to you. It sucks when it feels like you can’t fully communicate your struggles, and sucks even more when it seems like OTHER people are upset by it! Like, I am the one living with this hearing loss, it frustrates me ALL THE TIME and EVERY DAY, why are you frustrated with me?! &gt;:( 

Hang in there. Here, we understand and feel you!! &lt;3

It depends on if it’s encounters that I have to be invested in or not, either for really getting meaning out of an interaction or if I’ll be working with someone over a long period of time.

I’ve had to invest time into some dedicated training on different accents that I encounter for work as things have come up. So when we were encountering more folks with Indian accents, I sought out good quality YouTube videos with someone lecturing with an Indian accents, when I started working with someone with a British accent I spent time watching the video version of the podcast she’s on or speeches she’s presented.

If it’s just a one off conversation I tend to be forthright about it my hearing loss and just say “hey, I’m deaf/hoh and struggle with accents sometimes”. Typically people are fine with that.

There isn’t really anything can be done when you can’t understand  someone (accent or not) than to ask them to speak clearly at a raised volume because you’re hoh

I go straight in with ""I'm sorry, I am a bit deaf, can you show me what you mean?"" or something along those lines that matches the situation. I'll also point to my hearing aids and smile. I say a bit deaf instead of hard of hearing because I feel like hard of hearing might be an English speaking phrase that doesn't translate well, but I could be wrong. I think it helps to phrase it as your own shortcoming rather than theirs, if that makes sense, because it places the emphasis on you not being able to hear and not on them not speaking clearly which is probably a more familiar situation to them when someone actually is being prejudiced. Basically I thought about what someone being prejudiced says and I do the opposite.

I have never related to anything more. 

Every job I have ever had, customers with accents? No bueno. I can never understand. I remember starting to cry when I worked for lowes because I got stuck on a call for the businesses to purchase something over the phone and a man was upset because I had him repeating his CC# like 10 times. The accent and the loud noises of Lowes was awful.

I love accents! But many do make it hard to understand. I usually ask people to repeat and explain that I’m hard of hearing. And by this point, I usually start signing naturally, which helps make my point. I don’t think I’ve ever offended anyone… 🫶🏻

Yes, I have the same issue. All you can do is explain I’m sorry I am hard of hearing. Can you repeat that? I have problems with accents from other regions of the country as well as accents from other countries. Enunciation is so important for those of us with hearing loss.

I don't I just look at them and say I'm going deaf please write it down

I just say I'm sorry I'm hard-of-hearing. Can you write it down or I just tell them accents. Are hard for me.

I explain that I’m hearing impaired

Don’t ask for repeats if you can’t hear them. Just something like ”I am a little bit deaf and I can’t hear what you’re saying. Would you mind writing name/adress/term down for me please?”

Focus on your hearing loss being the problem, not their accent.

I never mention someone’s accent. I just say very matter-of-factly “I’m HoH and am having difficulty understanding what you’re saying; could you please repeat yourself?” Or if they’re walking ahead of me and talking, or covering their mouth, I explain that I can’t hear them like that. By placing the “fault” with me, I’ve never had anyone take offense, and most people are happy to accommodate me. When I’m around kids who might cover their mouths or hide their faces when they talk, I try to explain that my ears don’t work very well and my eyes are my ears. I also will sometimes take my hearing aids out and tell them that that’s how I hear, but that they have to help me by speaking clearly and facing me. Most people will want to be helpful if you explain why you need help/support.

I always just say something along the line of, ""I'm sorry I'm hard of hearing and I'm having a little trouble understanding you, can you please speak slower? And my apologies if I have to ask you to repeat something a few times, it's not you it's me"", or something similar

Since I was diagnosed with cochlear hydrops, whenever I have a flare (which results in temporary low frequency hearing loss) I find it more difficult to understand people with Indian or African accents. 

I guess it makes sense.

This is my problem as well. I do read lips. I’m frustrated with Netflix as it takes me a while to find a movie and then it’s not in English. I wish they had an option to choose English only movies. As for people in life with an accent, I struggle so much. But I typically end up doing the same thing as I do with others. I just smile. If it wasn’t a question, most times people just move on. I can’t hear most people with any background noise, unless I look at them straight on and watch their lips. Oh, and I just dropped $6,000 on new Oticon hearing aids. Waste of money.

I get the same problem. It's tough because I have enough hearing that I haven't had to rely on lip-reading much, and therefore can't reliably use it to discern what someone is saying. In these situations I usually will ask the person in question to repeat themselves and clarify that I am hard-of-hearing. I also move my hair covering my ears to show them my devices so that they understand that I am being literal, not hyperbolic. Something that's also helped my understanding of different accents is listening to media with actors/creators/etc. who have accents that I typically struggle with. This helps me develop an understanding of the ways people with accents that I'm not used to form certain sounds, so I'm better able to discern what they're saying using context. It's still difficult, but not as much as it used to be. I'm not sure if this is helpful for you, as everyone's hearing loss is different, but I hope it is in some way. Best of luck!!",2025-08-29 17:37:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n3dxdu/how_do_you_handle_not_being_able_to_understand/
1n37z99,hardofhearing,Hiring for a very busy cafe,"Hello, 

I am a manager at a very busy cafe and have recently had an application come in for a front of house position from someone who is deaf and uses ASL/BSL/lip reading to communicate. I want to consider their application seriously and am very willing to organise accommodations but I wanted to ask this community for any thoughts, experience and advice. I am fully hearing. My dad has 5% hearing in one ear and 20% in another ear so I have some experience being around someone who communicates differently. I asked him and he said he'd hate doing front of house and thinks it would be too much, so I'm looking for other opinions! 

I'd love to hear from anyone who has worked in a busy coffee shop about their experience and how it worked, or if it didn't, why it didn't. Any and all advice is appreciated. 

Thanks!

I'm 'only' hard of hearing, moderate to severe across both ears and wear hearing aids. I can tell you from experience in retail environments and having been in a busy coffee shop that it's hard to dial in on what I want/need to hear. 

For someone fully hearing impaired, you're kind of compelled to think both realistically and at the same time fairly. The only way to know if this person can handle the job is to let them try. Do you have other positions in mind if it doesn't work out? Perhaps parking them at the coffee machines fulfilling orders would be better suited, or kitchen if there's one available. Something with a chit system that they can read and fulfil?

I have severe-profound hearing loss in both ears (don't quite qualify for cochlear implants but am close; if you're looking at ""percent"" of hearing I'm at about 13% on one side and 20% on the other.) I am an oral communicator that relies heavily on lip-reading. I worked in a busy cafe in college a couple years ago. my favorite part was making drinks and meeting customers, but it was very challenging for me with how loud the cafe got from customers in addition to the kitchen appliances. if it got too loud for me, I'd work in the back doing dishes and such. I'd suggest asking the applicant their preference and what accommodations would help them be most successful in different settings. it might be having a notepad and pencil at the register so people can write down orders, or maybe they prefer to just make drinks and do dishes. doesn't hurt to ask, and I'm sure they would prefer you ask and welcome the opportunity to make their preferences known!

I have progressively lost my hearing over about 30 years and I now wear hearing aids. I'm a librarian, which is very people facing, and I do find it increasingly difficult to communicate with patrons. I don't lip read, which might make a difference, but then again one of my biggest frustrations is people who move their heads around and don't look at me when they speak, since it sends their voices in different directions. I imagine that would e very difficult with lip reading as well. 

I personally would not choose to work in a customer facing job at this point, but if the candidate believes they can handle it, I would certainly give them a chance (assuming they meet the job requirements, of course.)

Thanks for coming here to ask this btw…

I personally would find the background noise to be too much with hearing aids but… perhaps the person could communicate with live transcribe on their phone or tablet or laptop? I honestly don’t know if this would flow well at all. To me it would be the best shot at allowing me to do something front of the house. Depends on how busy the place is as well. Would the ai tech be picking up other conversations, I wonder? 

Perhaps job duties could be modified to less taking orders/register and more making drinks and handing to customers while letting hoh employee get some practice at register when less busy?

are you UK based? i saw the person has BSL.  if so they will be entitled to Access to Work and this will cover the staff members support costs in work-[Access to Work Info ](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work)

I’ve waited tables and it’ll be nearly impossible to reliably predict. Slow day? I’ll likely need nothing because the place is quiet. Busy day? I’m going to be exhausted because lip reading is how I’m understanding everybody. My employer would have no idea what the next day was going to be.

Moderate to severe, wear HA’s, lip read &amp; know some ASL. I would recommend you hiring this person. Disabled people often get passed over for employment, even if we’re capable. Though illegal, employment discrimination is common. If this person is upfront about his/her disability, your customers should be reasonable, expect a little more time needed to order. But if it becomes a “problem”, yet the person is otherwise dependable &amp; hardworking, then find another job he/she can perform better!

Fyi due to disability anti-discrimination laws in the US legally you can't disqualify them based on their disability. Just fyi

Also just because your dad wouldn't want that just doesn’t mean every hard-of-hearing person feels that way.

When everyone was still wearing masks,  a store in my mall accommodated their Deaf employee by putting a sign out that said something to the effect of ""I'm Deaf and use lip reading to communicate. Please take off your mask when speaking to me."" You could easily do something like that, instructing customers to look at the applicant while speaking. Something that could be discussed as a backup is you providing a small whiteboard for people to write their orders down if this applicant gets burnt out from trying to lip read in a noisy environment.

If that’s the job the person wants and feels they can handle it with reasonable accommodation then there’s no reason not to give it a try! 

Be willing to experiment to figure out what works. Maybe that’s printed menus that people can pick up and read over and then point to what they want. Maybe that’s a notepad or white board at the counter. Maybe it’s a “please be patient and face me when speaking” note at the register. Maybe it’s mounting a Roger pen/mini mic/similar device near where people order. If part of the job requires phone usage, there are captioned phones if they’re comfortable with that. 

There are deaf/hoh owned restaurants and cafes in existence where everyone on staff has some amount of hearing loss. 

Many times accessibility is just a matter of patience and creativity and not throwing in the towel as “just too much of an inconvenience”. I work in an industry that has almost no deaf/hoh representation but lucked out with a company and team that is willing to figure it out as we go and we are thriving. Give it a chance!

It takes quite a brave person to apply for this &amp; be willing to take on the challenge. Help them with the necessary tools to meet but also rise above the standard &amp; have consideration for allowing them to do the best they can. This kind of person will reward you with loyalty &amp; perseverance with full effort!",2025-08-29 13:50:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n37z99/hiring_for_a_very_busy_cafe/
1n33zr0,hardofhearing,Looking for HoH pro/semi-pro live musicians using IEM,"Hello ! I'm 23, french, hard of hearing from birth and was impaired at 3/4 yo (""behind the ear"" type).

I've just joined an alternative rock band as a bassist, and our first rehearsal makes me face a tricky issue. We play with backing tracks and click, so all sounds go through **In-Ear Monitors**. 

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to adapt to this ecosystem in a way that comfortable and safe, and would love to find someone who's been there to chat with !

Few ideas below :

• My first thought was to just use regular IEM and crank up the volume to match my loss, but I was told by my audioprothesist that my hearing aids go through a custom compression the IEM don't have, and that loud volumes in the earbuds might be risky for the little hearing I have left.

• I thought of keeping my hearing aids and wearing isolating drummer headphones over them, but the comfort is 0% and they can't cover everything because of the impairment.

• The suggestion from my audioprothesist was to use a bluetooth TV Streamer that I have (ReSound Unite) to receive the sound straight into my hearing aids, which would be the most comfortable but might not be stable (maybe interferences with other HF comms), and I'm not sure the isolation would be enough. I have yet to test this at the next rehearsal, but I want to be extra cautious with the drums.

  
Thanks in advance for your time !

Hey there. I’m HoH and was the lead vocalist in a nine piece band for like five or six years. We used IEM, and my experience differs since I don’t wear aids. That being said, I will say your best bet is to talk to your band mates! You’d be surprised on the input they may have, and for me it was important to discuss what was going to be a challenge for me so we could all be on the same page regarding solutions.

I will say too, if you go for IEMs you’re going to want custom ear pieces. I’ve had around 15 surgeries on my ears, and I needed custom molded ear pieces due to all the scar tissue/damage that occurred externally.

Also, you will experience a strange “post gig ear fog” for lack of a better term. After playing a few hours with the IEMs in/walls of sound, you’re going to want some extra time to let your ears rest :)

I need power.   And even with the BAHA processor only the sound has greatly improved.  I’m impressed.

I can’t leave or escape my situation yet. I’m struggling to seperate their failing at being a respectful, adult human from my personal struggles and shame with my disabilities. Just looking for community, I feel so alone in this. Thank you for reading this 🫂

I'd simply start ignoring them ""sorry I didn't hear you"" until they get the idea and act like a decent human being. I always warn people if they don't communicate the way I need (facing me so I can lipread, stay by my hearing side etc) they just won't be heard. As for yelling, good luck to them maintaining that long term they'll just look like an idiot. Just reply back to them in a normal voice until they get the idea

Unfortunately I feel like some specifics would be more helpful in this scenario. Why do you have to put up with these people?

I hate to say this, but these are people you don't need to invest any of your time with. The problem is with them, not you. Just do what you do, the best you can. 

If this is a work scenario, involve HR like, right away.

I absolutely dig in during this interactions. I will be “more Deaf” than I ever have been. I can no longer read lips, or gestures, or hear ANYTHING. 

Treat me like an outsider, and I’ll shut you out entirely.

I weaponized mine. You’re muttering or whispering? I can wait silently until you speak in a normal voice. You want to yell like more volume will fix the issue? I can wait silently until you speak to me with a normal volume. Don’t want to do either? We’re not speaking until you do

Dear OP, I just wanted to let you know that I read your post and I sympathize and also empathize with you. I feel your frustration, and I’m glad others in this sub have shared a variety of coping mechanisms to help you get through this. I know that while you oftentimes (if ever) can’t change rude inconsiderate people, you can be conscious of your reaction to these people. I’m glad you are in this subreddit, and I just wanted to say that I have heard you and my heart goes out to you. I hope you are able to extricate yourself from these inconsiderate individuals soon. Please reach out whenever you feel frustrated or saddened… I’m right here with you.

I’m so sorry you find yourself in this situation. I’m glad people have offered advice to you and I hope you can find a way to get out of this situation at some point. In the meantime, I have found that if someone has ever treated me poorly in relation to my deafness, I have always calmly said “I’m deaf, not stupid” and walked away. If you are unable to do that, perhaps just walk away from any yelling situation until the person or people can speak to you in a more civilized manner. As other people have said, you can’t change people and their behavior at times, but you can change how you react back to them. I wish you all the very best

I’m so sorry. I know exactly how this feels. I wish I could help, but all I can say is that isn’t ok and you deserve so much better! 🫂

1n1d3ct,hardofhearing,TV sound through headphones  (No Bluetooth),"Hey! I’m really hoping someone can help me figure this out. 
So my dad is hard of hearing, he’s also elderly and does not understand new tech at all. I’ve tried to teach him but he’s easily frustrated and gives up.
 
He has had this device for a long time that he uses to listen to the TV. It looks like a mini remote and has different numbers on, it changes the volume he plugs headphones directly into it (3.5m jack)

He has now lost this device! Which is another concern because he doesn’t often leave the house, so no idea how he keeps losing things :(

I’m trying to find something to replace it but I don’t even know the brand name or what the device is called. It looked like old tech. 
I doubt his TV is Bluetooth compatible and I doubt he’d be able to use Bluetooth headphones anyway. 

I was hoping there’d be someone who might know what the device is called so I can try and get him a new one? Or something similar that he can just use without havjng to digitally connect anything?

see link for some examples. where are u based? 

TV Headphones for the Hard of Hearing - AmplifiedTelephones.co.uk https://www.amplifiedtelephones.co.uk/tv-headphones-for-the-hard-of-hearing.html

That sounds like a headphone amplifier maybe. Did it plug in to the tv too?

If he uses a hearing aid, a lot of the HA brands have dedicated devices for this purpose. They plug in to the tv and send audio wirelessly to the aids.

Roku?

Check the tv. Roku has a dongle. You can buy replacement remotes for $30.

If it isnt and he refuses to use bluetooth assuming your time has any value it'll be cheaper to buy him a roku tv that comes with a remote that's 3.5mm and  you or if you dont live nearby, paying the geek squad to hook it to his cable. Tv will be $150-200. Geek squad prob another $100 but check first.

Wow, this is so beautiful. You meeting your mum where she is at with her hearing loss instead of expecting her to meet you in the hearing world. 

This is going to stay with me as a HoH person, reminding me of how often I am hard on myself but this is only because of internalised audism.

Often people don’t want to try other communication than just speech, because it’s just weard and not normal communication. That’s just wrong. I wish more people would try to do things differently sometimes and notice that sometimes it actually opens up communication.

I use the translator app on my phone.  It was a lifesaver during covid hospitalization.   Always nice when someone thinks of something like this to improve a life.  Hopefully  you will have many more years to use this.

Awww I love this.

1n0le1i,hardofhearing,"20 years old with Auditory Processing Disorder, mild hearing loss &amp; auditory attention difficulties – looking for advice","Hello everyone,

I’m 20 years old and was born with Auditory Processing Disorder due to a genetic factor. Since childhood, it has affected my daily life. I can hear people’s voices, but often it feels like they are far away — even when they are close to me. Most of the time, I cannot understand what they say unless they repeat it once or twice. On top of that, I also have mild hearing loss and difficulty with auditory attention, which makes focusing on conversations even harder.

This makes conversations (especially in noisy places) really frustrating and sometimes isolating.

I’d like to ask:
– How do you cope with communication in daily life?
– Do hearing aids, apps, or strategies help in cases like mine?
– How do you deal with the social/emotional side of this condition?

Any advice, resources, or personal stories would mean a lot to me. Thanks so much! 🙏

Since your problem is with processing sound I would propose an experiment.  Do a search for Cued American English and you should find a few free training video series.  After you've gone through the training videos you will know if you can process English easier visually than verbally.  It won't solve your problem but knowledge is power.

I’m HOH, on the moderate/severe side. I’ve worn BTE hearing aids my entire life. I also have a Deaf family so ASL is also in my back pocket. 

As far as coping strategies, I tend to make self-deprecating jokes over my hearing loss. (Kind of like I take away people’s “power” if I beat them to it first.) 

Repetition: If it’s people I’ll never see again, I’ll bluff my way through the conversation and puzzle out the words I didn’t get later. If it’s the absolute pits, I’ll text it on my phone’s Notes app and they can answer that way if they prefer. 

It took me several VERY long years, but I finally found my tribe. My friends don’t care that I have to make them repeat themselves because they’ll rephrase what they said so I’ll get the missing part. They’ve done charades for me, which was hilarious, and they’re just very, very accepting of me as a whole. (Bonus: they now watch everything with captions! They were so excited to tell me that they “can hear the TV better”, LOL!)

I don’t use many apps so I can’t speak to that. I’m sure others here can help in that area. 

I hope this helps you a bit. It is/can be isolating, but keep putting yourself out there and you’ll eventually find your own tribe, too.",2025-08-26 13:08:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n0le1i/20_years_old_with_auditory_processing_disorder/

Having difficulty following conversations like everything just gets dropped or not even held by my brain. Literally struggling to focus and remember on things said 10 -30 seconds ago. It’s like it’s not clicking in my brain.

Wondering how much of it might be related to hearing loss.

I already have had an MRI but the neurologist isn’t available until December.

Thanks.

I would recommend talking to your primary and requesting a full blood panel to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or hormone imbalances. Also, I would record yourself sleeping to see if you’re snoring. Are you at a higher risk for developing conditions related to cardiac function or other bodily functions? These things can all impact your overall function and should be checked.

When my mom, then in her 60s, experienced similar short term memory loss  she was alarmed and thought it might be Alzheimer's disease.

It was not.  
In her case, short term memory loss was a side effect of a blood pressure medication she was taking.  
She was able to remember facts and events again once she got a different medication.

I wish you well.

I also have the same issues. I went to the dr years ago. He told me it was a lack of focus. I was so frustrated I never went back. Fast forward, I got a bad concussion from a car accident and had to work through a couple of years of therapy. At least now o have something to blame it on.

I’ve experienced a similar thing. Had significant hearing loss in last 2 years and find I can’t recall information or remember people’s names like I did. Think it’s likely because I’m missing lots in direct and indirect conversations and not sleeping as well because tinnitus has ramped up x10🫤

Hope that you are able to find an answer. I’ve experienced similar issues since my loss started in 2022. It deteriorated a bit more rapidly in 2023. By the end of that year I started noticing issues with concentration, focus, and becoming forgetful. Quickly losing track of my thoughts. I’ve received an MRI and CT scan, though nothing was found. I’ve not seen a neurologist yet however. Hoping that once you’re able to see one it provides you with information!

It could be caused by that, but it also could be something different, or a combination of things. Maybe you got a stressful time and need a break, or something.",2025-08-25 15:44:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mzu1rf/immediate_memory_deteriorating_and_difficulty/

I keep explaining myself to them to try to get it to improve but it doesn’t and I get very irritated. It’s not their fault, they’re just kids but it gets me down. At the end of a week long stay I am grumpy and my partner sees it. We’ve started having to have times when we have the kids where I get to be home alone and decompress. He takes the kids out for a number of hours so that I don’t get constantly worked up. It does help but then I carry the guilt of not wanting to be around the kids. It’s a double edged sword.  Maybe being a drinker would help. 

We don’t have a basement either.

I just space out and don't bother trying to listen sometimes. I figure if it was really important they would make the effort to get my attention and communicate clearly. Its like I don't hear anything if people don't get my attention first and its not that they weren't loud enough for me to pick up sound, its that my brain has somehow learned to tune out conversations I can't hear clearly.  So its being in the room still but also being checked out... its peaceful. And you don't have to hide in a basement drunk to do it.

We have a basement, but it's my husband's man cave and office area and he likes the TV on constantly, so it wouldn't work for escape  I get what you're saying. I'm lucking if I have 1-2hrs of social energy in me even when I'm with friends that I know well and like. It's hard to be 'on' for any length of time and work tends to take most of that time. Then I doomscroll and don't feel much better for it. Hope you figure out something to help you feel more restored.

I can identify with you. I have 2 teen daughters who full on yell when I ask them to repeat themselves. My husband says never mind when I ask him what he said. Sometimes being at home with family feels extremely lonely and isolating. I can’t imaging how I will feel though when they are both gone on their own. Oh, I also want to hide in the basement, but I don’t have one. I hide in my room when I get frustrated.

Also gen X with two teenage daughters. 🙌 I’ve worn hearing aids since age 2.  It’s hard work!   I agree- being in between two worlds is tough.  Not hearing, not Deaf.

I grew up and lived in Southern CA for most of my life. I moved north to Utah and everyone has basements! I work in the basement and have to admit, I do like that space to get away from upstairs activity. It is quieter down here, most of the time.

I'm Gen X and have been wearing hearing aids since '93. I felt between the worlds for a long, long time. I have found my place with a lot of work but I still exhausted with the communication someday. I phase out of the noisy world taking my hearing aids out. Everything fades to mute and if anyone wants to talk to me, they have to use the 3 Golden Rules... Get my attention, face me and be within 6 feet. Hell, they have to use the 3 Golden Rules even with my hearing aids in because they aren't hearing miracles! My hearing aids can only do so much.

Luckily my kids are grown and gone but I remember those tough years and feel for you!

There's a lot of whys behind the 3 Golden Rules so I wrote about it here to help others. They help save my sanity. [https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/)

1mw3vvi,hardofhearing,Struggling with hearing loss and feeling left out—how do you handle it?,"Hi, I’m a 25-year-old woman living in Korea. My English isn’t very good, so I got some help from ChatGPT. In Korea, I’m not officially considered hearing impaired, but I do wear hearing aids. My tinnitus started when I was in high school, and I began wearing hearing aids as an adult. At first, I only wore one, but now I wear them in both ears. Currently, my hearing level is around 55 decibels in each ear.

I started wondering what kind of jobs people with hearing loss have, and how they cope in situations where they can’t fully understand conversations—like when meeting new people or being in noisy places. Do you let others know about your hearing loss from the beginning, or do you just try to manage? I’d really like to hear about others’ experiences and opinions.

Personally, whenever I have to interact with people or go outside, I get really nervous without even realizing it. Once I get used to it, I feel better, but there was a time when I’d come home completely drained and exhausted. I can hear sounds, but I often don’t understand what people are saying. After asking them to repeat themselves a few times, I’ve had people frown or just stop talking to me, which made me feel small and discouraged. Talking on the phone is also very difficult for me. Once, a family member even told me, “Why should I talk louder just for you? My throat hurts,” which really hurt.

Honestly, I don’t know how I’m supposed to live going forward, and it all feels so overwhelming.

It sounds like our experienoes are very similar in many ways.

My hearing loss is pretty much in that range. Everything you wrote really speaks to me. I’m older &amp; grew up without any support and without understanding that my problems were mostly related to hearing loss.  I’m happy for you that you understand the issue so early.

The first thing that helped me was realizing that the nervousness was due to difficulties processing and trying to understand without being able to hear everything. Once i understood that, things got a bit better, i realized that it was my hearing loss rather than some deeper personality problem.

Honestly, i haven’t solved everything, so i’m interested to see what other reddit users suggest, but here are some things that have helped me:
1. i stopped expecting myself to function normally in situations where i can’t hear well. Sometimes i need a break. So it’s okay for me to not try to get every conversation, or to go do my own thing.
2. I tell people that i am looking forward to talking to them, but that i’m hard of hearing and won’t get everything
3. I try to find opportunities to chat with people one-on-one.
4. I try to control the hearing environment: 
5. I learned sign language. This has been amazing for me. I can finally communicate without the struggle to hear. I’m only limited by my skill, which will gontinue to improve while my hearing continues to get worse. The more i learn, the more i identify with the Deaf community.
6. MIFI microphones (that send sound directly to my hearing aids) or iphone’s live-listen feature allows me to hear 100% of one-on-one conversations and more of the group conversations. If i avoid places with a lot of background noise or reverb, it can be considerably better.
7. Communication with my family. They used to think i was a jerk for interupting or ignoring them, or for controlling conversations. They are slowly realizing that while i’m not perfect, a lot of the communication issues are actually a result of my hearing loss.
8. Learning more about hearing loss and how it affects people. This reddit channel has helped a lot. There are also some good books on life with hearing loss, but i’m not sure many of those are in Korean, but it looks like there are some, such as •	『나는 청각 장애를 가진 심리 상담사』  that might be interesting.
I’ll come back and write some more if I think of anything, but the fact that you’re searching for answers is the most important thing!
I’m curious, what have you found to be helpful?

It has been a bit of a journey for me. When I was first diagnosed at 18, my hearing loss was 45-55dB in both ears. I felt shame wearing my hearing aids and instead of telling people I have hearing loss, did a lot of masking, pretending, mirroring people like laugh when people laughed, nodding like an idiot when I did not understand. At work, I never said anything. My line of work is emotionally/mentally draining by nature and the listening fatigue did not make it easier, for sure.

With the support of a hearing therapist, I have gained confidence about disclosing my hearing loss, I have progressed in my career and recently gained another qualification in a profession where listening is a huge part of the work. My hearing loss now ranges between 55dB to 80 dB but I consistently tell people about my hearing loss and what I need, even at work. I ask for adjustments to reduce listening fatigue and prioritise self-care so I do not burn out.

Wearing hearing aids is only a partial solution, they do help us hear better but do not make us hear the same as ""normal"". It has been a long journey to accepting this. Even with the latest technology and gadgets, adjustments and other strategies are needed. Once I made peace with this idea, I worked on understanding what strategies helped me in different situations, experimenting with how sound works - like where I sit, what type of room. If it is too noisy, just switch off the HAs or if it is for a conversation, ask people to move somewhere quieter etc.

What I found is that the more confident and assertive I have become around my hearing loss and adjustment needs, the less rude and dismissive people are. They likely see it through our body language. I still have areas I need to work on, undoubtedly but even though my hearing loss is gradually but surely approaching the profound range, ironically, I feel better about myself now than when I had mild-moderate hearing loss.

I am aware than different countries, different cultures may have different attitudes toward disability and this will influence how we feel, think and relate to others. Part of the journey for me has been to push boundaries one tiny step at a time. The times when I felt/feel exasperated and exhausted of educating people are numerous but I remind myself that even without hearing loss, we need to manage differences with others.

I inherited my hearing loss. I grew up with people saying “never mind” after the third repetition of what they said. It’s particularly hurtful when it’s the punchline of a joke that I never get to know what it was. 

That “never mind” feels and is dismissive. Plus, it reinforces my self concept of not belonging with other people or groups. I feel excluded, especially when I need to set up a favorable environment that creates “extra work” for them. 

I recently learned that when people say “never mind” that our response should be something like “Please, I really would like to hear what you have to say. Do you mind trying once more?”

I have not tried this approach yet. 

[Never Mind article](https://livingwithhearingloss.com/2015/05/26/please-dont-say-never-mind/)

Tell yourself it doesn’t matter what you don’t hear. It’s a shift in mindset from the assumption that we need to hear everything. Hearing Aid industry promotes that idea that we are broken so we go buy their products to be “fixed”. Accept yourself. Reject that which you are not and cannot be.

Use captions for all the calls. For mobile pixel has good captions.

You're not alone with that experience! It's actually even a common situation for people with hearing loss. There are even studies about the correlations of hearing loss and social isolation.
I personally am very honest about my hearing loss and tell people about me being hard of hearing. It's making things clear for people, so they know what's going on if I need to ask them to repeat things more often.
Also, I can tell them about what it's like to not hear everything, if they want to learn more about it. Creating a bit of awareness, that helps to avoid misunderstandings on both sides. Because most people don't know much about being hard of hearing, what exactly is damaged in the ear, and how the little machines in my ears work.

I’m here seeking for answers too, so I am so sorry if I couldn’t give you exact solution to this problem. 

However, I want to say that I hear you. Everything you say is relatable because I experienced what you experience too.

She is having some health issues and has had issues getting phone calls to schedule appointments and things like that. I was wondering if there is any app or program that could be put on a phone or her tablet that can turn a phone call into text while she speaks to them and then she can respond back verbally? Any help is appreciated.

Location? Innocaption is only in the US because it’s paid for by the FCC.

Phone call captioning is built into both mobile operating systems now:

iPhone

https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-live-captions-of-spoken-audio-iphe0990f7bb/ios

Android

https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en

It does require the use of a headset so you can see the screen. I have my ""action button"" on my iPhone set to Live Caption so I can pull them up with one click. 

One downside of the iPhone version (idk if Android or Innocaption are different) is that it only captions the other person, it doesn't caption your own speech. I'm used to captioning on Zoom and other video calls that captions everything, so it's a little weird.

I've been using two phones, one an old pixel phone with the recorder app to record the call  and it does transcription

and the newer pixel to do the actual call using the speakerphone function and the caption call option turned on.

but it seems the other suggestions here are better than what I've been doing.

1mv026q,hardofhearing,Popping in ears for three years,"Back in 2023, I got very sick while traveling (possibly covid) and ever since then I’ve had persistent popping and fullness in my ears when I swallow or talk. I also have hearing loss from former deployments and the popping makes hearing much more difficult. Sometimes it wakes me up at night. Doctors keep saying it’s allergies and gave me meds that didn’t work. I feel like they don’t take it seriously. No matter what climate I’m in, it never lessens. I’ve never had allergies or trouble with ear fullness before this issue appeared. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

[댓글]
I had what I believed to be a popping ear, and it turned out there was a small dog hair inside my ear canal that kept rubbing on my ear drum. My doctor took a waterpik (one of those water flosser things) and flooded my ear with water for an extended period of time. The little hair finally dislodged, and my ear popping stopped.

Have you seen an ENT? I wonder if it’s related to your Eustachian tubes.

Had this too. My ENT checked Eustachian tube function - all fine. Eventually the audiologist tested the pressure in my ears and found that my eardrums didn’t move when under pressure suggesting something in behind. Few weeks later they gave me grommets because sprays etc just hadn’t worked. The surgeon said that when he made the incision into the eardrum it was “full of mucus and crap” 8 weeks later and it’s clearing so so much. 

Worth asking this question.

So I want to ask will my ears be redamaged if I have too loud volume in my headset even I do not feel loud for me?

Do your hearing aids have a Bluetooth feature? That’s what I do. 

Yes, the loud volume can do more damage to your ears. Me personally, as a kid I never worried about out it because it was the only way I could listen to music.

Be careful with this for sure. I've gotten myself in a paradox a few times where I turn music or games up loud enough to sound as loud as I remember from before hearing loss. Because I now have significant loss, if I do that, it means I'm listening to the music \*way\* louder than I should be, which then causes additional hearing loss, and cycles. 

It's a pretty safe bet that if you have bad loss, whatever sounds loud to you now will make that loss worse.

Does your brand of hearing aids make a device that hooks up to your TV and streams into your hearing aids.. I wear Widex Moment HAs and I have 2 devices for this.. One is a TV-DEX that hooks up to the optical out port on my TV and streams the audio from my TV directly to my HAs and the other is a COM-DEX that does the same with my computer.  I use the computer one for work to listen to Zoom/Teams calls and YT videos, but I'm sure it would work for gaming..  I know the TV DEX works for gaming, I've used it with my Xbox on that TV.

You can get volume-limiting headphones. I have a pair of IsoTunes Bluetooth ear buds that limits the volume to 79 dB with no microphone. There is another version with a microphone that limits the volume to 85 dB.

Yes, you should stream the sound to the hearing aids instead.

The headphones aren’t adjusted to your hearing loss. So either you won’t hear the sound correctly at those frequencies you have a lot of hearing loss in, or you increase the volume but then get too loud sound for those frequencies you don’t have a lot of hearing loss in.

Why not talk to your audiologist?

I have been using Shokz, bone conduction headphones. Since they use your skull instead of your ears to transmit the sound, there is like no risk of further loss.

This would be a good question for your audiologist. My hearing is such that my audiologist said listen to whatever I want to because it's not going to make my hearing any worse. But that is specific to my loss which is Progressive and genetic in origin so I'm going to go completely deaf eventually anyway. Also as far as music and audiobooks or anything you run through your phone you can get a app with an equalizer and use your audiogram to invert it into the equalizer and that should allow you to equalize your hearing so when you do turn the volume up it works better.  You may even be able to purchase an equalizer for your TV and gaming system and run your headphones through that. One last thought on the behind the ear versus in the ear is to consider how easy it is to lose and in the ear versus the behind the ear. I've had hearing aids for 40 years and the in the ear ones are horrible if you just set them down without thinking about it and forget where you put them. If you think hunting for car keys is difficult wait till you misplace one of those itty bitty in the ear ones. At this point I have the colored inserts for my behind the ears so that at least I have a chance of seeing them.

Yeah, high volume is something you have to be mindful of. I have a program called ""Equalizer APO"" on my PC, that I use to adjust the sound to my needs. It's not perfect, but it does a bit of what the hearing aids do and allows me to have a more normal volume on the headset.",2025-08-19 16:16:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mun0cl/headphone_volume_while_hearingimpaired/

First, you should speak to an audiologist about your options. Do not get OTC hearing aids they will make your hearing worse. Sometimes, your dr has to really go to bat for you to get your covered like mine did . With my insurance, I got my hearing aid for free ( costs was 4k)  as it was covered on my insurance ( they just didnt want to pay it.) Do u have insurance? The cost out of pocket could be less. Also, ask if you're a candidate for Cochelar Implants. My insurance covered that except the initial consultation. I got one CI on one ear and a hearing aid on the right ear. Im going in for another consultation for the right ear to get a ci put in there because the CI beats the hearing aid by miles. Ex. Clarity, volume, no pain on/inside the ears, etc. I know the struggle and the exhaustion of trying to strain yourself to try to hear. Its annoying and drives u and everyone around u crazy trying to communicate.
For reference of what aid I have:
RESOUND hearing aid and Cochelar nucleus 8

Are you in America? If so, reach out to your state's Vocational Rehabilitation center. they can help with financing the hearing aids, especially since it's something that makes your job easier! don't try and do over-the-counter ones, Sam's Club, CostCo, etc.; go with what your audiologist advises. I have Phonak Marvels for a severe-profound hearing loss and absolutely love them. but again, reach out to your local Voc Rehab and they should be able to help you

Personally I’ve been hard of hearing for 50 years since a baby. Got hearing aid at 5 years old. Hate them. I tailor my life to not have to need them. I have simple Driving job. Listen to podcasts all day. Figure out how to be yourself instead of how to fit in according to societies expectations. That is too exhausting.

Would I say that I'm ""half deaf"" since I cannot hear at all out of one ear? Or is it more proper to just say that I'm hard of hearing? Or does it not matter, and this is a silly thing to be worried about?

[댓글]
Deaf is a spectrum and your label is your choice. When introducing yourself or reminding people, I would say “Deaf in my left ear” or the right ear is the good ear. Just something so people know how to communicate with you. If you say “half deaf” people tend to just talk twice as loud, which doesn’t help.

I struggled with this...am I ""hard of hearing"" or ""I can't hear well""...I decided I'm just hearing impaired. That usually suffices.

It doesn’t matter - I have a moderate hereditary bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.  The only thing I won’t call myself is deaf, because that can imply not hearing at all or membership in a particular group.

I say hard of hearing when I’m just being casual.  I say hearing impaired when I need the other person to quickly understand they need to speak up, though I also just tell people “I wear hearing aids” to make things clear sometimes because I’m still young-looking and my hearing is still good enough that I “pass” as normal hearing.

If you have a hard time hearing because of hearing loss but don’t have total loss then you’re hard of hearing.

I say “deaf in one ear,” unilaterally deaf is the technical term.

How you describe yourself is entirely up to you. You might get some comments if you say ""hearing impaired"" (it's my preferred term, I actually hate saying ""hard of hearing"", though I do it for others out of respect for them), but you are an autonomous individual with the right to call yourself as you wish. 

I used to say ""half deaf"", but now I just say ""little-d deaf"". 

Imo, using more technical terms helps with people understanding the severity of the situation. ""I don't hear well"" is often met with ""oh, I don't either."" 

But also, I'm so sorry, that's a lot of change to deal with.

I used to say hearing impaired, but I now think hard of hearing is more accurate.  I wouldn’t use deaf, because I can get close to “normal” with hearing aids.

Say whatever you want though. Nobody really cares, or at least they shouldn’t.

My usual intro: “Hey, my ears are trash. It helps if you speak up and make sure I can see you when you’re talking. Thanks!”

I tell folks I’ve lost the hearing on my right side.

""I have a hard time hearing and wear hearing aids.""   
That's all they need to know. And if they're especially tuned in, they'll ask for clarification. ""I'm hard of hearing, stay to my left side. Hearing aids aren't perfect but I get by.""",2025-08-18 17:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mtsjli/what_do_i_call_myself/
1mtr8dp,hardofhearing,Hearing aid quote,"I have congenital hearing loss, and was recently retested with moderately severe hearing loss (~60db both ears, as expected). The audiologist recommended a set of either Phonak or Oticon receiver-in-ear aids for $7300, and it would include all future visits/adjustments for the life of the equipment. I have zero insurance coverage in my policy for hearing aids. I'm in my 40s, and this is my first time looking into getting hearing aids due to the cost, and I'm still feeling some sticker shock. They didn't provide details about the specific models, but indicated the Phonak (which I preferred) had a 2nd microchip for managing background, would be water resistant for exercise, and have bluetooth connectivity, so maybe it is the Audeo Life Paradise; but the purchase costs for a pair seem much lower online?  I liked the sound quality during the test, and the center is well-rated/reviewed in my area, but it felt like a ""these 2 are your only options, pick them up next week"" hard-sell kind of experience.

Does that price seem unreasonable for my level of loss and the ongoung support/office visits? Or is it worth shopping around? 

[댓글]
I paid $6,000.00 for mine so I'm not entirely surprised by the cost. Do you have a Costco near you? They can be significantly cheaper.

If you're in the US check out Ebay. People sell used Hearing Aids on there quite a bit. Sometimes they sell new ones from India they're still phonak or oticon or other brands but the prices are a lot more reasonable. I've done this maybe three or four times and not had much of a problem. Even if you run into a problem, if you can get a pair for a couple hundred dollars, it's worth the Gamble. The only thing I would advise if doing something like this is that you make sure you have access to an audiologist who can program them. If they're older models, they may not have the software or the connecting cable, and some audiologists may not work with them just on the principle that they make too much money selling a new one

If you’re in the US and need them to save your job you may benefit from vocational rehabilitation. Medicaid rates though. Seems awfully high.

I paid $4150 for my last pair

Phonak 

I suggest going with a closer audiologist at least for your first pair. You may need multiple sessions to get the best out of the device until you’re comfortable with them an understanding the different options available

Apparently there are some leasing programs available that might work for you.  As a new user you may get very little use out of them at first, at least until you get used to them.

As far as online prices go it's not really fair to compare them with an Audiologist.  Although they may only make about $45/hour they are going to charge you $200/hour.  Since those are included in the cost of your hearing aids over time your free adjustments may be worth the difference in initial price.",2025-08-18 16:40:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mtr8dp/hearing_aid_quote/

How to understand your results. I’m one of the people who would take a test you run and ask zero questions because I was raised in a cult and have no idea how to ask what your tests mean.

How to take HoH and Deaf more seriously. I love technology, enjoy hearing, and I do appreciate all the opportunities that exist today, but there definitely is an overemphasis on hearing being the only way to communicate, get social inclusion and prevent dementia. There are many things that are harmful with this worldview:

* What happens to those who can’t get a CI? The health care system seems to totally ignore these people’s situation, because they can’t fix the problem through medical means. Those who aren’t helped by the development we have today, they also deserve communication and inclusion. This group is getting worse and worse conditions and no one seems to understand how important it is to have solid language access and inclusion even when spoken language is not accessible. 

* We HoH are **always** at a disadvantage every time we have to listen, even with the best technology. The person with normal hearing will always be able to hear more in social situations. The consequences of that are devastating. We are always judged by our ability to hear anytime we communicate. That’s not fair. Allow us and encourage us to use communication that is 100% accessible to us, like sign language or text. 

Hearing is a great tool, and necessary and convenient in a hearing society, but I think there should be much more emphasis on how to actually allow us to communicate on more equal terms. We shouldn’t be forced to rely on our weakest sense all the time.

Can you really lose hearing from a virus?

Differences in symptoms between HoH and sensory processing issues, and the correlation. In really simple terms.

Hi, will tinnitus and over-sensitivity in my ear go away? Six months ago I got hearing damage caused by a sudden, loud sound. My audiogram shown a big notch at 6-8khz, reaching to 8dB. Now it's at 60dB. What's worse, I've had tinnitus since then and this ear became super sensitive to louder or higher sounds. When a sound is above a certain volume level, it's kind of distorted and if it's from 6-8khz range, it's painful. I was wrongly diagnosed and started recovery process too late (I went through HBOT only after 2 months after the accident).

Other than that I don't really feel much difference in hearing in my every day life.

Tinnitus, though, usually gets quieter when I rest or go to sleep, it's not constant or harsh but still annoying. It has got better since the beginning but it's still really annoying. I was told many times by doctors that the hearing loss is irreversable but my audiologist said that tinnitus and over-sensitivity will likely go away (may take up to a year) but I don't really know. I think it's more of a mental struggle.

I would like to hear your opinion on that.",2025-08-18 09:57:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mthpr2/help_for_an_audiologist_please/

I’ve attached my audiogram - audiologist says otosclerosis or something like it, ENT advised same however I’m going to a new ENT for a second opinion. Does this look similar to anyone with the same conductive loss? I’ve also got SNHL from my work, so it will automatically be lower anyways. Also how does one fix this? HA? Surgery? Any tips or tricks?

My ears are not self cleaning like at all not even a little bit. They are made of skin grafts! Yay! So I have to go to an ENT to get them cleaned out. Except they don’t look normal so I need to get my ears microsuctioned. Problem is since my regular ENT retired no one else micro suction my entire ears.

ENTs won’t clean my ears out with micro suction. Some even say there’s nothing in there. I’ve been to many ENTs one even walked out on me. I started getting pictures. Showing crusts (dead skin builds up from the skin grafts). Still doesn’t get cleaned out. I tried going to the neurotologist that’s worse they won’t clean my ears. I tried a fellowship trained ENT he won’t listen. I went to Mexico. I have pictures from clinic level otoscopes. I just need my ears cleaned out how do I tell them? They all want to not touch me when I go in but just chit chat and then waltz out without a care. How do I establish a relationship with an ENT who gets me? My ears build up dead skin every three days. It’s skin graft from my trunk they used for my ear drums and canals. Yay! Its rare! It’s constantly building up and no professional seems to understand my ears aren’t self cleaning! 

I even went to a world renown clinic that does tons of CIs and they wouldn’t clean out my ears the way I need and then played this psychological game it’s all in my head. Even though I have pictures. 

Please how can I talk to an ENT? My hearing is affected and now my ears ring. If I say I still feel the stuff in there here’s a picture. They just say no there isn’t I looked. Meanwhile the skin graft in there is building up dead skin cells. 

If I bring in information from medical textbooks it’s completely ignored and not reviewed. 

Then they’ll ask for an audiogram! Fun!

1miwq9c,hardofhearing,untreated trauma,"I’m the strong silent type. Like Sylvester Stallone. At least what I believe in me. I don’t want people around me to worry about my. Most importantly, my family.

Three weeks ago, I just finished hearing test and diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss. At least 38% hearing loss at both ears. At 20 years old. To be honest, I didn’t cry about it. It was liberating. I am right. It’s not in my head. I acknowledged it.

Now, everything changed. I always bottled up my feeling. I didn’t confront it. Like a fire which starts slow, it grew into something I can’t extinguish. I am depressed. I need help. But, I don’t know how to. I didn’t have any friends. I don’t have money to go to therapist. I want help.

Thinking about how it all makes sense now. It’s not about lacking focus or ADHD. I am not antisocial. I just have hard of hearing (HoH). That’s why I couldn’t understand what people said clearly.

Growing up, it is hard to pinpoint exactly what is my problem. My parents thought I was slow. I start to speak late than any other children. I still talk like a baby until I was 6. “You should be aware of your surrounding”. That’s what they always said to me. I can hear what people say, it’s just not clear.

“When you can’t (physically) do what society expects you to do, you go around it and rebel”.

I fucking go to hospital a lot of time to receive the treatment. But there always something to hinder me from it. Dad rejected further appointment. Doctor needing previous document. I was a minor. All fucking excuses. I fucking hate the world!!!! I want to be dead. I fucking fucking hate it. I hate the way I am born. I want to stop everything.

Hey friend- your trauma is valid but also there’s no reason to wish you were dead over this. You are going to be just fine. You’ll have some minor annoyances but those seem to have been there for a while and now you know what they are and you will be able to manage them a lot better than you did before you knew.

You are going to be fine.

Looks like you are grieving the hearing loss. And feeling helpless because it’s not something that can be fixed. 

Start with allowing yourself to grieve.

I can relate to this. It took me a horrendously long time to get used to the way things are. To top it off my family has [cult ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science) which made it so much harder to seek help.

1mita6e,hardofhearing,"Muffled Dialogue in Movies and Games (System-Wide Windows PC, Channel-Specific Fix for Headphones - Especially If You Have Hearing Loss)","After YEARS of whisper-quiet dialogue being drowned out by music and explosions, I finally fixed it — and it works across the entire system, not just in VLC or one app. Now, this is for WINDOWS PC. I have tested this with several headphones and DAC/AMPs with/without.

This method lets you:

* ✅ Boost **dialogue (center channel)** only
* ✅ Tune **specific frequencies** per speaker
* ✅ Adjust **each speaker/channel volume independently**
* ✅ Apply it **system-wide** (games, YouTube, Netflix, VLC, etc.)
* ✅ Tailor it to your **hearing loss** using an **audiogram**

**🚨 IMPORTANT: Source Must Be 5.1 or Higher**

This fix relies on your media having a **true 5.1 (or 7.1)** audio track.

Why?

* Dialogue is isolated in the **center channel** in surround mixes.
* Stereo (2.0) audio has **no true center channel**, so boosting dialogue selectively is **not possible**.
* **Dolby Atmos for Headphones** virtualizes the full surround field (including center channel) for stereo headphones — letting us isolate and EQ it.

||
||
|**Source Type**|**Works with Dialogue Boost?**|**Notes**|
||||
|Blu-ray / MKV rips|✅ Yes|Best case — full surround mix|
|Netflix / Disney+|✅ Usually|Confirm surround is active|
|YouTube / MP4s|❌ No|Usually stereo — no isolated dialogue|
|Games|✅ Yes|Most modern titles output 5.1+|

**🧰 What You’ll Need**

||
||
|**Tool**|**What It Does**|**Cost**|
||||
|**Dolby Access**|Enables virtual 5.1/7.1 surround w/ center channel on headphones|**$14.99 + tax (one-time)**|
|**Equalizer APO**|Core engine that filters audio system-wide|Free|
|**Peace GUI**|User-friendly interface for per-channel EQ and volume|Free|

**🔧 Step-by-Step Setup**

**1. Enable Dolby Atmos for Headphones**

* Install **Dolby Access** from the Microsoft Store
* Go to Sound Settings &gt; Output &gt; Spatial Sound
* Set to: **Dolby Atmos for Headphones**

✅ This creates a **virtual surround mix**, including a proper **center channel**, even through regular headphones.

**2. Install Equalizer APO**

* Download: [https://equalizerapo.com](https://equalizerapo.com/)
* During install, make sure your **headphones/output device** is selected
* Reboot after install

**3. Install Peace Equalizer GUI**

* Download: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/)
* When prompted, click **“Yes”** to overwrite config.txt
* Launch Peace and choose **Full Interface**

**🎚️ Boost Dialogue &amp; Tailor to Hearing Loss**

You can now:

* Adjust **each channel independently** (Center, Left, Right, Sub, etc.)
* Apply **per-channel EQ** (e.g., boost only dialogue frequencies on the center channel)
* Apply **different EQ per ear** (Left/Right) using your **audiogram** or hearing test

**Example: EQ for Center Channel (Dialogue)**

||
||
|**Frequency**|**Gain**|**Purpose**|
||||
|500 Hz|\+2 dB|Adds warmth and low-mids to voice|
|1000 Hz|\+4–6 dB|Boosts vocal clarity|
|2000 Hz|\+4–6 dB|Adds presence and enunciation|
|4000 Hz|\+2–4 dB|Consonant sharpness|
|8000–16000 Hz|\-2 to -4 dB|Reduce sibilance or hiss|

We used a real **hearing aid audiogram** to shape the Left and Right channels for hearing loss, and EQ’d the **center** for dialogue boost.

**4. Save Your Preset**

* Click **Save**, name it something like: Dialogue Boost - Custom Hearing
* You can bind it to a Peace hotkey or slot (Set 1–4) to toggle on/off

**🎯 Why This Works Better Than App Fixes**

Most apps (like VLC) only boost center within the app. This setup works:

* 🔄 **Across all apps &amp; games**
* 🧠 With **custom hearing loss profiles**
* 🎮 In games (like Call of Duty, Elden Ring, etc.)
* 🖥️ On **YouTube, Plex, Jellyfin, Netflix**, WHEN SUPPORTED WITH 5.1 AUDIO SOURCE and more

**🧪 Bonus Tips**

* ✅ In Peace, enable **“Prevent Clipping”**
* 🔊 Lower Preamp in each channel if EQ boosts are too loud
* 🎧 Works great with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and games
* 💬 You can boost center *and* shape full headphone sound signature

1mifowh,hardofhearing,Explain my hearing loss,"Can someone explain my hearing loss?

I’ve had hearing loss since I was around 6 or 7, but I never got hearing aids despite a report showing it.

My father also developed hearing loss in both ears around 16 after pneumonia.

I can’t remember any other cause for my hearing loss. I do remember severe earaches in early childhood, which may have been an ear infection.

Interestingly, my 2-year-old brother also has hearing loss in both ears. He recently had a 1-year-old son and was diagnosed with mild hearing loss in one ear.

No other family members have hearing loss.

Doctors and genetic testing haven’t found an explanation.

Can anyone suggest a possible cause?

Also, can someone comment on my hearing loss results and advise if it worsens? My hearing is muffled, but I can still understand people I know.

Am I considered deaf? Apologies for the silly questions, I don’t really have anyone to talk to or understand my hearing loss. 

I usually wear hearing aids at work or social events, but not at home.

I would say you are considered hard of hearing since you can hear some but not well.

we can’t know why you have hearing loss. could be the result of your infection or it could be genetic (your brother and nephew have hearing loss) 







No you wouldnt be considered deaf as you have some level of hearing.

My genetic hearing loss is (we think) caused by Ehlers Danlos Syndrome

From what you shared, you sound more hard of hearing than deaf (the term ""deaf"" gets used in different ways, sometimes medically (severe to profound loss), sometimes culturally (people who use sign and identify as Deaf, capital-D)). Since you still understand people, you're probably in the mild-to-moderate range. If you're curious, you might want to try over-the-counter hearing aids. My husband's in a similar spot and he's been using OTCs from audien hearing. They're not as high-tech as traditional hearing aids but they help with speech clarity and are way more affordable. Super easy to use since they work right out of the box and there's no fitting or appointments needed.",2025-08-05 17:35:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mifowh/explain_my_hearing_loss/

Were you tested for auditory processing disorder or do you have tinnitus? According to you the results of the test showed your hearing was fine. Even people with good hearing struggle in noisy environments like you described. This suggests your hearing issues aren’t the result of loss but rather environmental factors. As you acknowledge you have issues hearing when you aren’t concentrating and the environment is loud. With all the aforementioned information it would seem the solution is to pay more attention to what people are saying and limit external noise.

Yeah, I had the same thing, “normal” hearing on paper but struggling in noisy spots. What helped me was trying an OTC hearing aid with good noise reduction. Way cheaper than custom ones and it actually makes group conversations less exhausting.

I went with [this one](https://rewarduplevel.com/aff_c?offer_id=1904&amp;aff_id=36719), but honestly any decent OTC model that boosts speech and cuts background noise could help if you’re in the same boat.",2025-08-05 09:52:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mi4wyx/product_for_people_with_hard_of_hearing_problem/

I’m the primary support person for my mom. She recently underwent a major operation. The great thing is that she is cancer-free! However, the down side is that she is deaf in one ear. 

Down the line, she has the option of a procedure to get a bone anchored hearing aid. For now, however, I’m looking for key technology, gadgets, or devices that could help her. 

What do you wish you had known about or used as a hard of hearing person? 

I’m thinking about her alarm clock…she falls asleep on her hearing ear, so her deaf ear is facing up, and she can’t hear her phone or alarm. I did turn on the flashlight setting on her iPhone so it flashes and vibrates when she gets a message. 

I’m educating myself on behavior changes, of course - speaking louder, slower, clearer, close by, etc. 

Thank you in advance!

Not sure where you are but www.connevans.co.uk stock a lot of accessories

When she gets the aid  check out Deaf Metal for jewellery

Two apps have been life savers... first is Innocaption.  Have it on my Phone.  Transcribes phone calls as I have them.  Second is Otter Ai.  Transcribes conversations live as you have them.. invaluable at doctor appointments .  I dont know if links are permitted here but you can google them and they are first results

My phone's vibrate is loud enough to wake me reliably but they also sell bed shakers that'll definitely do the trick.  

Also look into connecting it to the fire alarm.  Or flashing visual alarms for that.

Communication tactics beyond just louder/slower/closer:

The first word said is almost always lost/not heard because you're still latching on to the fact that someone has started speaking.  Wait until you have their attention.  ""Hey so um I'm looking for... where are the keys?""  

Don't repeat exactly when things aren't heard.  Vary how you say it, both in word choice and intonation/pattern.  And give more context.  Words make sense in context.

""The keys"" - ""the what?"" -&gt; ""for the front door, the keys, keychain, for the lock"" *mime using a key*

Check with the local fire department. Many used to be able to at least install flashing smoke alarms. I’m not sure if they do anything else.

I have an alarm that goes on my wrist and vibrates to wake me up. Also the Live Transcribe app has been a lifesaver many times. As for behavior changes, I usually do miss the first part of what someone says if I don't know that they're talking to me. Making sure you have her attention, or she knows that you're addressing her before saying something could be useful, depending on her preference.

Look into Sunrise Alarm clocks.",2025-08-04 19:08:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mhmmv9/seeking_advice_for_supportive_devices/
1mh6azs,hardofhearing,Tinnitus getting worse?,"Hello!

I've been diagnosed with tinnitus for about 7 years now, getting the official label when I was about 15 years old (now 22). I am not exactly sure when, but sometime over the last year it's gotten much worse to the point that I can hear the ringing in my ears through music, over fans, and even in crowded rooms if I focus just a bit. I know there's no cure for tinnitus, but is it possibly worth going to get checked out again? It makes it hard for me to sleep and process what people are saying to me. I'm unsure if tinnitus alone makes me HOH so i do apologize if this is not the correct place to post, but any advice on what I should do moving forward would be appreciated. One thing I will add- I am autistic and use noise cancelling headphones (at a low volume, usually less than 20% or so) on a daily basis to help regulate, and sometimes i sleep with the noise cancelling on and no music if my partner is particularly noisy. Do we know if noise cancelling alone can worsen tinnitus?

Thank you!

Have you gotten your hearing tested?? I have moderate hearing loss in my right ear and tinnitus for over 10 yrs now.

Definitely worth it to get checked out. There are conditions that can cause ear ringing, and you’ll want to know if there’s an underlying reason for it and if it can be treated. An ENT doctor or an audiologist should be able help you.  

Tinnitus can be a symptom of hearing loss itself. You might want to bring up the fact that you’re having trouble processing what people say to you. Hearing loss can be very subtle and often shows up as issues with speech clarity, where you can hear someone, but have trouble actually understanding what they’re saying. I have both tinnitus and hearing loss, and wearing aids does help relieve the tinnitus temporarily. 

I don’t know about noise cancelling headphones making tinnitus worse permanently, but I definitely notice my tinnitus more when wearing them. I think the lack of auditory input makes my brain kick into overdrive and makes the tinnitus more noticeable. Very quiet white noise can actually help make tinnitus less noticeable, so that might something you can experiment with to see if it helps or not. 

Also stress, high blood pressure, dehydration, and certain medications can make tinnitus worse. Might be worth drinking a lot of water and looking into other possible causes to see if anything’s making it worse.",2025-08-04 06:45:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mh6azs/tinnitus_getting_worse/

Welcome! Have you been to a doctor to find out the cause of your hearing loss? It's possible that there's something going on (like wax buildup) that can be reversed, and if not they can discuss your options.

1mgyyrl,hardofhearing,Grandma has vertigo,"My grandmother has been suffering vertigo for about a year. It started after the hearing aids that she liked, which would charge on an outlet, outside of her ear while not in use, suddenly stopped charging and her doctor gave her new hearing aids that had an internal battery. Within a day of use, she started experiencing vertigo so she's quit wearing her hearing aids and has spent the last year being seen by various doctors to try and figure out the cause of her vertigo. She lives 2 hours from us and has to drive here for her doctor's appointments, but has become scared to, because of her vertigo. She said her eyesight also seems to have extra sensitivity to light, although I'm not sure there's any correlation, but ear, nose and throat DO have related issues, so I don't want to omit that statement.

I feel terrible that I haven't sat down to piece all of the history together sooner, but I did tonight, and she shared with me that she had a stapedectomy 40 years ago (which is metal and the reason she can't do an MRI). 

1st question I asked google- what material is used for stapedectomy. 
Older uses were steel, tantalum, platinum. Newer options are Teflon and non-metalic options

2nd question - what are the symptoms of a dislodged or failed stapedectomy?
One of the symptoms is vertigo.

3rd question - do hearing aids with internal batteries have magnetic properties?
Most hearing aids, including those with internal rechargeable batteries like lithium-ion, use a combination of components that are susceptible to magnetic interference. 

So, looking for info of the potential for her vertigo to be related to her latest hearing aid batteries being a bad mix with her older metal stapedectomy, thus causing her vertigo.

Has anyone heard of something like this happening or experienced this themselves? 

I suggested to her that she get on the schedule with an ENT other than the one she has been seeing that has written her off as a medical mystery, and I will be attending the appointment with her to address these questions and hopefully, any additional info I can gather from readers who may share similar experiences or have knowledge of this type of situation. 

Thank you so much in advance!

I've lived half of my life with a vestibular disorder (the vestibular system is what controls spatial awareness as well as causing vertigo when things go wrong).

An otoneurologist is the kind of specialist doctor she needs to see, not necessarily a general ENT. While it does seem like her vertigo \*may\* be related to the hearing aid, it could also be entirely coincidental. The only way to know for sure is for her to visit that specialist.

1mfudf2,hardofhearing,Need to vent thank you for reading,"So we have an interim supervisor at my job, i’ve barely spoken to them, we aren’t friends.  I let them know as i do with all new employees that i am hard of hearing and that if i don’t hear you, that I’m not ignoring you.  

They react by having the biggest smile and asked me if i told the other interim supervisor (there’s 2) and i said no.  I thought that was weird but i just shook it off.  

They then come back into my area and mention something about their child who i ask about.  They say their child is young and then they begin to mimic speaking to me but with no sound coming out and say their spouse does that with their child, pretends they don’t hear the child.  I just look at them and smile awkwardly cause that’s weird af.  

So during that interaction i gathered that they think it’s funny that i can’t hear.  

So then they come up yesterday to say goodbye and they do the mimicking speaking without sound again!!!  They say oh i’m gonna do this all the time like it’s the funniest thing ever. I’m helping someone so i couldn’t really react.  

Then i starting getting anxious and angry like i don’t know you well enough to be making fun of my hearing loss, you’re in a position of power over me and it’s just rude af.   I called my direct supervisor and told them you do realize that being hard of hearing is a disability right?  

So i left, they texted me to apologize but I’m left with anger and questioning why the fuck do people think my hearing loss is a fucking joke.  I’m fucking tired of it.  

If you got this far thank you…..

You can have a multitude of conditions that are supported but hearing? It's a joke. Have excellent health coverage? Maybe you'll get 2g  towards 8g hearing aids. You are accountable even if you hear stuff wrong and the majority of times you say ""pardon"" people get annoyed and repeat things in the exact same volume/direction as the first time, and look annoyed to boot.

What a couple of douchebags, and you definitely have grounds for bringing this up with THEIR supervisor. Make sure they are aware that mocking a disability is illegal under the ADA. 

I had a situation where a co-worker outright mocked me to my face, and in front of another co-worker, in a similar manner. I went to my direct supervisor, who was great. She spoke to him alone and then with me present. He gave me a halfhearted ""I'm sorry if you thought I was rude"" type apology, which I didn't care about, and my supervisor told me privately that this guy had a few incidents in his file already, and she had added this one. 

I didn't feel the need to take it further after that, but I might have if he was someone with authority over me. 

I'm sorry this happened to you.

Document this, including their apology. Insist upon an in person apology. Texting it to you is insufficient. There is repentance and repair work to be done here, which includes them facing you, hearing you, and acknowledging that their actions were hurtful. They need to become the person who doesn’t do this kind of thing in the workplace, and hopefully not at all.

This is harassment and bullying and SO unkind and not professional. Like at all.
Go to HR. They have zero tolerance.

This is terrible, I am so sorry this happened to you. I have coworkers (who know I am HH) that will intentionally talk quieter after I ask them to repeat themselves and then laugh when I ask again what they said. 

One way I have found to take back my power from microaggressions like these is to hold an accountability mirror up to their behaviors/words. For example, if that interim supervisor does that mimic speaking again, you can allow for a few seconds of silence while you take a deep breath with a smile on your face, and say “did you think I’d think that’s funny because you know I’m deaf? :)”. It will surprise them and their response will tell you everything you need to know. Might sound a bit petty, but it’s effective as hell.

Report them to HR for harassment about a disability. If you're in the States, it's illegal under federal law.

I’m really sorry this happened. I hope this 
 supervisor’s interim period is short and you can work with someone more empathetic. 🫶🏻

Hang in there, sadly there are a bunch of stupid people we all have to deal with.

That's a really difficult situation. Their behaviour is disrespectful and toxic af, but what to do about it? From my experience, if you don't do anything they'll keep bullying you. But if you say something, they will act like they did nothing wrong and you were the one being unfair and aggressive. People like them cause trouble, no matter what. :/",2025-08-02 16:11:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mfudf2/need_to_vent_thank_you_for_reading/

1mfjx9r,hardofhearing,got told hearing can improve but I still can't hear?,"Had hearing loss in the higher ranges for years. Diagnosed as pretty mild, still a pain in the tail. It was diagnosed in 2020 right before covid. My doctors company went under so it hasn't had any follow ups. 

Could swear my hearing is worse than it used to be. Walked past a mall kiosk today where they did hearing tests. Sat down to do it. Had to hit repeat on the upper half 7-10 times and I literally couldn't tell if I could hear the sound or if it was just because there was an animation in time with the beep on the screen and so I was following that. I always hit that I can hear it if I'm ever not actually sure because I don't want to skew it. 

Mall kiosk test actually said no hearing loss at all. All in the green. Not even border line. Despite the woman having to repeat herself explaining it and shutting the front doors to cut back on background noise. She said sometimes because I'm in my mid 20s hearing can improve even if it previously tested in the loss range. But I still can't hear people when they talk! Am I nuts? Did my hearing actually get better and I still somehow just can't hear people?

Ps it isn't central auditory processing disorder, they did a long test for that and said I did not have it and just have hearing loss. 

weird reddit glitch so posting again to fix, mods please don't incinerate me

Am I following this right you were told by some mall kiosk your hearing improved? I’m very doubtful of the validity of results from a mall kiosk. You should be seeing an audiologist.

You mistake commercial events for healthcare. There is a reason audiologists and Ear-Nose-Throte specialists have many years on university training. Please go and see a professional.

I wouldn’t consider anything being done by untrained people at a mall kiosk accurate. They want you to stop and spend money on them, they’ll say whatever it takes to get you to stop.

Giving the kiosk some credit I always need a test done in a specialized soundproof booth for them to be accurate for me. I just need a nurse to walk loudly up a hallway to make my test to come out inaccurately. I’d get it redone in the proper way to see if it’s stable or worse.

Hello! First year audiology student here! I recommend you to go to an audiologist, they could test you for higher frequencies (which in the kiosk they normally don’t do) and also perform other tests to understand better your hearing loss, like speech testing , otoacoustic emissions , tympanogram etc

I wouldn't put too much stock in mall kiosk tests. They're more like a quick screen than a full hearing check tbh. I'd recommend a full hearing test, either in-person or online. Don't just go off that one mall result. If budget's tight, there are OTC hearing aids that are decent and affordable. I've been using audien atom pro 2 for my mild hearing loss and it's only &lt;$200 for both ears. It's not fancy but it helps with speech clarity and bg noise. Works right out of the box so I just charge and go.",2025-08-02 06:49:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mfjx9r/got_told_hearing_can_improve_but_i_still_cant_hear/

The sound waves are likely bouncing back all over the place so you need materials with soft surfaces instead that absorb the sound. For example, carpet flooring is better than wood or tiled flooring, place a table cloth on table, put some sound panels on the wall.

1mfdqva,hardofhearing,Newly Diagnosed with Otosclerosis &amp; Severe Tinnitus – Seeking Advice (Canada),"Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed with otosclerosis in my left ear after CT scans and multiple hearing tests. My hearing loss is around 60-70%, which is frustrating, but the real struggle is the tinnitus. It’s severe high-pitched, loud, and constant.

I’m lucky if I get 4-5 hours of sleep, it literally wakes me up. It’s been two years now, and despite what people say, it hasn’t improved. Some days the volume dips slightly which is a relief, but the anxiety attacks, especially at night, are relentless.

My ENT has given me two options.

Surgery - I was told it could restore my hearing and, more importantly, fix the tinnitus. However, the risks include losing my taste permanently and total hearing loss in that ear. Since I’m in Canada and my ENT hasn’t performed this surgery in years, I’d need to go out-of-province and start fresh with a new specialist.

Hearing Aids - I was told they can help with hearing, but they likely won’t do much for my tinnitus given how severe it is.

Another factor is that I’m a former chef and may want to return to that career. Losing my taste would be devastating. The tinnitus is unbearable, but is surgery worth the gamble?

For those in Canada **a**ny  top-notch surgeon you’d recommend? If you chose surgery, how did it go? Any regrets?

Personally, streaming music helps distract from the tinnitus.

&gt; However, the risks include losing my taste permanently and total hearing loss in that ear. 

...

&gt;but the real struggle is the tinnitus.

You kind of get used to it. The nerve deadens or something. I have a really loud refrigerator which hums and I used to leave a fan on in the summer and I have a white noise machine too which I used at first but I kind of got used to the tinnitus.

You'll want to dash your head out against a wall for the first few months but after that it's kinda eh. Avoid loud noise.

I also put on the radio low at night if it's very quiet and I'm at the computer.

You can't fix tinnitus. Anyone who tells you that you can is lying. You do get used to it, and the white noise stuff makes it p easily bearable. I'll look up the white noise machine I was using if you want.

Is your hearing loss across all frequencies? Can you post an audiogram?",2025-08-02 01:12:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mfdqva/newly_diagnosed_with_otosclerosis_severe_tinnitus/

I don't have a CI (yet) but my wife is an audiologist and we've talked about it a lot as my hearing continues to deteriorate.

First, a lot of people do better with a CI even if they still have functional hearing in that ear - there's a reason the 60/60 rule exists.

Second, consider getting a bed shaker, I use one for my alarm and another connected to a baby monitor so I get woken up when my infant son is crying. They have systems that you can connect to fire alarms, intruder alarms, whatever you want. 

As for how it sounds, you'll likely get used to that before too long.

Last thing, you won't necessarily lose all your hearings - some do, some don't. You might still keep what you have in that ear after the surgery.

I'm not telling you to get one, just that a lot of the scary parts may not be that scary. 

Best of luck.

I would say it’s not worth losing the little hearing you have in that ear. Look into better hearing aids. Highly recommend learning ASL and accepting being proud of your HH / deaf identity. Get an alarm for your house w lights if you’re concerned about intrusion.

You often have intruders in yourhiuse? Sounds like a US thing to worry about.

Fire alarm and doorbell can easily be connected to a vibrating unit under the pillow and flashing light. 


Have you read many articles about the statistics of Deaf and HoH who die in accidents? Somehow, I believe you’re overestimating the risks, maybe even that you think they are thousands of times larger than they are in reality.

I do understand you worry, and I don’t mean to belittle that in any way. But do try to look at what really is harming Deaf and HoH. I assume it’s things like discrimination at the workplace, not getting enough interpreters and things like that - not that we all die from not hearing an alarm.

1mef1oc,hardofhearing,Advice for unilateral hearing loss?,"Hi so, I'm 20, uninsured, and poor, but today I finally saw a doctor for the first time in like 13 years about my hearing loss. He confirmed I've got ""moderately severe"" conductive loss in my right ear and very very mild loss in my left at high frequencies.

it's genetic probably as my grandfather and Uncle have hearing loss. About ⅓ of my right ear drum was just never there. Idk what's going on with my left ear though.

Anyways, being broke, uninsured, and American, surgery isn't an option right now, but the hearing loss is annoying as hell so I'm looking into hearing aids. Trouble is, I've got no clue what I'm doing.

I think I'd prefer some that were behind the  ear and fairly durable. My budget doesn't exceed $300 or so. Any recommendations would be appreciated.

Google if your city has a vocational rehabilitation place , sometimes social services like that will pay for your hearing aids and help you find job placement or even pay for college or point you in the right direction. Also your state my have insurance for you if you’re poor enough.. it probably won’t cover hearing aids, but may be useful for other dr appointments and such.

contact your city's Vocational Rehabilitation service- they can help you with securing hearing aids and other technology or supports you may need.

Shop around providers, check for financial assistance and start saving. Unfortuently not much else can be done.

You'd want to do some research on models of course, but check ebay. An uncustomized hearing aid will be better than no hearing aid. Some audiologists will even be willing to program them for you even if you didn't buy one there.

  
You can also buy new aids from various places online for about 50% of what audiologists charge. Some of those online retailers will program.",2025-07-31 22:07:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mef1oc/advice_for_unilateral_hearing_loss/

1mcvr1n,hardofhearing,Advice for Next Steps,"I need some advice for my 5 (almost 6) year old, please. He has had 2 tests with an audiologist, one showed mild hearing loss and one was basically “normal.” However, it seems clear to everyone around him that he has trouble hearing. 

Some examples: turns the volume up way too loud when watching screens. Talks loudly in normal conversations. Has speech difficulties. Doesn’t always respond when you call his name or talk to him - you have to get his attention visually or tap him on the shoulder sometimes. He definitely struggles in noisy environments, but not only in them. He has also flat-out said that he has trouble hearing. I also should mention that he did have meningitis at about a month old, but made a full recovery and no one ever told us that hearing loss could be a result long-term. We found that out recently when doing our own research. 

We’re seeing his pediatrician to follow up, but what should we ask for next? His doc is great and will get us referrals for whatever we ask for, but I don’t even know where to go from here. I read some things about tests that can be done for hidden hearing loss - is that a thing in young kids? This seems like more than an auditory processing problem, but could that be causing all of this?

Thanks so much in advance for any advice!

I’m not a doctor. I would ask for a referral to an audiologist to confirm hearing loss. Then maybe an ENT. Hearing aids may be needed. Along with that comes a 504 and/or an IEP (assuming you’re in the US). 

In any case, learning sign language won’t hurt.

My family has sex linked progressive hearing loss.  This means most of the males have hearing issues to some degree.  Since we all start out with mild loss and it grows my generation and the one before were raised with the hearing centric focus.  By the time we are in our 50's the loss is in the 80% range.  Lundsgaurd's advice is excellent about the medical side.  The next step is to work with your school district and state education agency to find out what kind of support is offered.  It's been 40 years since I was in grade school so my experience is very dated, but once my district was aware of my hearing loss they provided regular screenings and even bought hearing aids a couple of times.  The second thing I would advise is to make sure you ask if the DR can tell if this is a stable loss or likely to be progressive.  If it is going to be progressive I would recommend getting involved with the deaf community now.  Raise your child as if they are already deaf and they will be prepared for that eventuality.  Treat learning sign language as if you live in a dual language household and your son's life will be far easier growing up.  I'm 54 and just starting to use sign language even though many in my family are nearly deaf.  It would have been easier if I had been using it all along. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.  Good luck to you.

Ask for a comprehensive audiological evaluation including tympanometry and ABR testing - meningitis can definitely cause delayed or progressive hearing loss that standard tests might miss initially. Also push for an ENT referral since the symptoms you're describing (especially after meningitis) really warrant a specialist's evaluation rather than just standard hearing screenings.

Would suggest seeing another audiologist and ENT for more clarity. In the mean time try learning ASL together to help communication",2025-07-30 03:12:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mcvr1n/advice_for_next_steps/

I had an... interesting... exchange with someone on the librarian sub I frequent this past weekend and wanted to see what you all think. Am I overreacting to be upset with this person's response to my post? To try to be as brief as possible, I posted a vent about a library patron who rolled her eyes and tried to get a coworker to help her instead of me, because I didn't hear her when she spoke to me and asked her to repeat herself. As you know, this kind of thing happens all the time, but for whatever reason it just happened to get under my skin, so I blew off steam by posting to the sub. 99% of the people who commented were sympathetic, and a few fellow HOH librarians shared their own similar experiences. It all ended up being very lighthearted and made me feel 1000% better immediately. Then there was this person, lol. (She is NOT hearing impaired.) A few highlights from their comment(s):

""Patron could have some issue of her own. Sometimes, we can't see beyond our own struggles to see someone else struggling, too. This could apply to both of you.""

""I have a parent who is deaf and at least two other family members who just plain don't listen to me. I may get stabby (jk) with the next person who asks me to repeat myself.""

""I personally don't think I'd force a patron to work with me if they were uncomfortable even if their discomfort was unjustified, like they were blatantly racist or something.""

And then my favorite, as posted in the title. Again, this person is not hearing impaired, but this is her response to me saying that due to my hearing loss, I sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves:

""it's my job to lean in and listen harder, not their job to speak up""

Like, wow! That's all it takes?? Damn, these hearing aids were just money down the drain! 

LOL, by now I am definitely seeing the humor in how absolutely clueless she is coming off, but I'm posting here both as another vent, and to ask for y'all opinions... is there anything I'm missing in the exchange that has validity? For context, here is the original post and commentary:

I refuse it. My go to response is ""well, since you don't want me to hear you I'm just gonna go back to what I was doing.""

Quite frankly, I'm surprised she can hear anything at all with her head so far up her ass.

This would immediately send me over the roof. You're a stronger person than I.

It's your job to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on medical care and maintenance, hearing aids and their maintenance. It's your job to use what little focus you have remaining in the world to be hyper aware of someone not bothering to even try to speak up.

Whoooooooooo... I'm steamed just reading about it through you.

I’m truly sorry you had to deal with this at work and that you received this ignorant reply. My hearing loss really only impacts me when it comes to work. It’s frustrating to just be trying to make a living and have someone rolling their eyes about it. I had someone roll her eyes in an intake when I said I’m hoh… there was a team of people in the room and I was at a loss for words and I just said: wait, this is a disability agency? Are we not being friendly to pwd in this meeting? I said it with a smile and no one said anything else… but good lord. I have people put me on speakerphone all the time, too, and I explain that I need to be able to hear them - they don’t change a thing. Remain on speakerphone with kids crying in the background and pots and pans banging together, car doors opening.

Nope. Absolutely rude. I would say, “excuse me, I’m hard of hearing. Would you mind repeating yourself?

Did you have similar experiences?

I definitely wish I hadn't waited as long as I did. 

I was first diagnosed at age 18 and tried a hearing aid then but didn't really need it and so returned it. My hearing loss is degenerative, however, and by my mid twenties I really could have benefited from hearing aids, but didn't actually get them until I started being functionally deaf in some environments when I was 30. It took an employer (very gently and politely) asking if maybe I needed hearing aids after there was a meeting where I full stop could not understand a single thing the client was saying.

I do, I found out two years ago that I have two different genetic conditions that cause deafness. In junior high school I went to a doctor for hearing problems and was blown off. I knew there was something wrong. But, I was told I was ok. I’ve become fairly good at reading lips. 
However, if I had gotten the help I needed then- hearing aids, ASL etc. my life would be better now.

I had a hearing aid.  I refused to wear it.  Partly because it was uncomfortable but also because I was in denial.  

I wish I had worn it more.  In hindsight I always had difficulties caused by it and I was in denial of those difficulties, too.  Only when it got so bad as to be completely undeniable did I accept where things are, in my 20s.

It made me introverted and awkward.  Yes.

I've had single side deafness dye to the mumps since I was about 4. I'm currently 50. Over the years somewhere my hearing side declined.  I finally got my hearing aids 3 days ago.  I really wish I would have had them as a child. I feel like everything would be different if I was able to understand what people were saying back then. I think people wouldn't have thought i was just aloof and stuck up when I didn't answer them because I just didn't hear them.  Also I think I would have likely been less shy.

I have a genetic defect. Hearing aids are like 8gs and i work where I'm constantly wearing a respirator and other miscellaneous ppe; I'd probably lose them even if they were affordable. I hate that the coverage on hearing is like $500 a year, you can't accumulate it. I guess I've just accepted saying 'what' a lot.
I can also sleep through anything so there's that.

I don't. Let me explain why.

I was diagnosed with hearing loss when I was 5. But I was so ashamed of wearing hearing aids back then, since I was bullied for my weight and I thought this would be another reason for bullying. Plus, the doctor didn't believe it: I was successful academically, which didn't align with the doctor's idea that I should be bad academically. 

6 years later, another doctor said that I had to get hearing aids now (age 11). So I get hearing aids, but life still ain't better: classmates are jealous (not because of hearing aids, for something else), so even though I can hear, I wasn't socially ""in the class"".

7 years later, and finally, people were seeing my hearing aids less of a nuisance and more of a ""oh, that's fine"" thing.

My question for the good people of this sub:

1. Has anyone here experienced SSNHL in both ears at different times like me? I thought this was supposed to be a more rare condition, something like 27 in 100,000 people.

2. Based on your experiences, is there anything you have found helpful for the tinnitus and reduced hearing ability? I have a follow up appointment with my ENT on Wednesday and I'd like to be able to suggest treatments to try, to see what he's on board with. Also open to non-medical interventions/techniques that have worked for you that I could do on my own.

1madpw8,hardofhearing,"Progressive Hearing Loss – Looking for Advice, Support, or Shared Experiences","Kia ora everyone,
I’m (nearly 30F) from New Zealand and I’ve been coming to terms with a progressive hearing loss that I only noticed a couple of years ago (2023), when I was about 27.
I’ve now had three audiograms over the past three years (screenshots attached), and they show a significant drop over time, especially in the high frequencies. So far there’s no clear cause.

I’ve been wearing hearing aids since 2023 (Oticon Jet2 mini rte), which help in some ways but not in all situations and I’m starting to feel frustrated by my hearing. I’m also starting to worry a bit about what’s coming next for me, whether my hearing will keep declining, if I’ll end up needing cochlear implants, or how this will affect my work and life long-term. I’m also starting to wonder whether I’m doing enough or seeing the right professionals.

Have any of you been through something similar? What helped you in the long term and short term? What should I be doing now to make sure I’m prepared or supported?
Any thoughts, advice, insight, or shared experiences would mean a lot.",2025-07-27 04:53:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1madpw8/progressive_hearing_loss_looking_for_advice/

(AND YES, I KNOW OTHER METHODS TO MAKE THE TEXT EASIER TO SEE, BUT THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL CHOICE, SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT, THANK YOU.) ALSO, I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY GRAMMAR OR SPELLING ERRORS IN ADVANCE, AS THOSE AREN'T MY STRONG SUITS.

ALSO, PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF THIS IS A LONG POST OR IF ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS SEEM STUPID OR EVEN ABILIST OR DOWNRIGHT CRUEL IN ANY WAY. SINCE I AM DESPERATELY TRYING TO AVOID WRITING STEREOTYPES/MISINTERPRETATIONS ABOUT CHARACTERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH THINGS I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH.

P.S. PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I'VE ASKED THESE BEFORE. THANK YOU.

FOR CONTEXT, ELLIE (NICKNAME FOR MY HOH CHARACTER), IS THE ADULT STEP-DAUGHTER OF A RICH FAMILY AND HER STEP SISTER IS THE FAVORITE, AND WHILE ELLIE ISN'T PSHYCIALLY NEGLECTED, THERE'S STILL SOME EMOTIONAL DAMAGE TO SAY THE LEAST.

NOW, QUESTION 1, CAN IT BE REALISTIC FOR HER ONLY TO HAVE TO USE ASL (AS SHE'S VERBAL BUT STILL LEARNED IT AS A KID DESPITE HER STEP-FAMILY IS INSISTING SHE SPEAK, HER REAL DAD IS HOH TOO), SO COULD SHE HAVE LEARNED IT FROM HIM?

ALSO QUESTION 2: CAN IT MAKE SENSE FOR HER ONLY TO USE ASL WHEN HER HEARING AIDS ARE DYING/DEAD/NOT WORKING RIGHT?

QUESTION 3: I'M NOT TRYING TO ASK PPL TO WRITE MY CHARACTER FOR ME, I JUST...DON'T WANNA MAKE ANYONE IN THE DEAF/HOH COMMUNITY ANGRY WITH MISINTERPRETATIONS EITHER. SO, BARRING THAT, I'M ASKING/SAYING THESE NEXT THINGS TO BE SAFE. I HAD SOME PEOPLE SAY DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THIS NEXT SITUATION, WHICH I'LL GET TO IN A BIT.

BUT IT'S THE MAIN REASON WHY I'M POSTING THIS, JUST TO ENSURE I GET MORE ANSWERS BEFORE I MAKE THE FINAL CHOICE. ENSURING I'M DOING THINGS RIGHT. ANYWAY, FOR ***MORE*** CONTEXT, ELLIE IS GONNA GO TO A HEARING TEST APPOINTMENT AT SOME POINT IN THE STORY, (THIS ISN'T HER FIRST ONE SHE'S DONE THS HER WHOLE LIFER RPETTY MUCH) AND EVERYONE AROUND HER KNOWS IT.

&amp; SHE'S ALSO GETTING READY TO GET NEW HEARING AIDS. (I KNOW THEY'LL TAKE A WHILE TO COME IN). NOW, SHE FINDS OUT DURING THIS THAT HER ""WORSE"" EAR HAS GOTTEN WORSE HEARING WISE.

NOW HERE'S WHERE THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES COME IN: (AGAIN, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE HER LOOK WEAK, OR ""POOR PITIFUL ME"" OR MAKE THE DEAF COMMUNITY LOOK BAD). BUT FOR CONTEXT ON HER HEARING: SHE HAS HIGH-FREQUENCY SNHL-(SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS), (POSSIBLY INHERITED FROM HER REAL DAD).

NOW...MY ORIGINAL INTENTION FOR THE HEARING TEST SCENE WAS TO HAVE ELLIE UPSET AFTER SEEING THE RESULTS, IN A ""IT'S WORSE, OH GOD I KNEW IT!"" KIND OF WAY. (MIND U JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR, JUST BECAUSE SHE WAS UPSET, DIDN'T MEAN I WANTED TO MAKE HER UPSET ABOUT HER DEAFNESS AS A WHOLE, I WANTED TO GIVE HER STRENGTH, EVEN IF IT'S QUIET STRENGTH).

BUT DURING THIS VERSION, SHE EVEN CRIES A BIT, MAINLY WHEN SHE'S ALONE WITH A FRIEND SHE'S COMFORTABLE WITH. ANYWAYS, I HAD SOMEONE TELL ME ON ANOTHER FORUM THAT THIS WAS DISENGENIOUS, AND SHE SHOULD JUST BE LIKE: ""OH WELL IT'S ANOTHER DAY."" IN A SORTS.

SO I'M THINKING OF CHANGING IT. 'CAUSE THEY SAID IT'D BE ABIELST AND RAGE INDUCING EPSEICLALY SICNE ITS TREATED AS SUDDEN DESPTIE ELLIE KNOWING IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE. A SYMPATHY PLEA.

SO I'M THINKING TO CHANGE THIS: 1 SHE ACTS JUST AS THEY SUGGESTED AND ISN'T BOTHERED BY IT, AS THE PERSON ABOVE SUGGESTED.

2 ELLIE ***IS UPSET,*** BUT NOT ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS, MORESO ON HOW HER FAMILY (MAINLY HER STEP DAD AND SIS) AND HOW THEY ARE GONNA REACT, MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT OF HER NEEDING NEW HEARING AIDS, AND HOW ""EXPENSIVE"" THE ""ADDONS"" ARE (IN HER STEPDADS WORDS, NOT UNDERSTANDING SHE BEING BENEFITED FROM THINGS LIKE WATERPROOFING AND BLUETOOTH CAPABILITIES).

PLUS I'LL SHOW HER STEP SISTERS ABUSE/RUDE COMMENTS (MAINLY ON ""WASITING MOENY"" ON HER ""BAD"" EAR I'M ALSO GONNA HINT AT HER HYPOCRISY TOO BUT THAT'S KIND OF BESIDE THE POINT).

BOTTOM LINE: IT COULD SHOW THEIR DYSFUNCTION AGAIN. OR IS THIS STEP FAMILY DRAMA, INSULTING TO REAL DEAF/HOH PPL AND AM I WRITING SOMETHING...TOO DRAMATIC? OR EVEN IN A NON-REALISTIC ""OH POOR PITIFUL ELLIE,"" TYPE OF WAY?

SORRY IF ANY OF THE OFFENDINGS ANYONE, I AIN'T TRYING TO BE RUDE, JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT, HELL I KNOW I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE BUT...I'LL WANT MORE INFO ON MORE DEAF/HOH PEOPLE'S OPINIONS, AGAIN, I'M JUST TRYING TO ENSURE I'M DOING THINGS RIGHT.

1m7rh3t,hardofhearing,Assessments used for Language comprehension,"My brother has been deaf since birth. When he was 3-6 years old, my parents tried Auditory-Verbal Therapy (which focuses on lip-reading and using hearing aids). However, they later realized he wasn't progressing in school because he was unable to understand or recollect sentences. Tragically, they stopped his therapy, and he didn't receive any other special needs educational support.

My parents weren't able to get him a correct diagnosis for what might be a learning disability, so they weren't able to support him effectively. He is now in his late 30s and has the vocabulary and reading comprehension of a first-grader. He heavily relies on his family for simple things, like filling out a form or talking to the store keeper.

I recently moved to the US and started learning about other forms of therapy, like AAC or resuming auditory-verbal therapy. I'm wondering if these could help him communicate better and improve his comprehension.

To start, I think my first steps should be:

1. Work with a specialist to evaluate his current comprehension.
2. Find resources that can help us support him better.

Does anyone have advice on how to approach this? Thanks in advance.",2025-07-24 01:36:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m7rh3t/assessments_used_for_language_comprehension/
1m7js7q,hardofhearing,Construction industry PPE (hard hat/eye protection) compatible with hearing aids,"Hi all, I work in the construction industry in
The UK and I wear hearing aids. 

At work we are required to wear various PPE/safety equipment including a hard hat and eye protection.

My problem is that wearing hearing aids under a hard hat is uncomfortable as the hat sits right on top of my ears (and by extension, my hearing aids) and causes constant whistling from them. 

The default eye protection we are provided is safety glasses, which make the problem even worse as they also need to sit on top of my ears/hearing aids, causing the hard hat to push down on both of them painfully.

Has anyone else found reasonable solutions to this problem or know of any safety equipment that can better accommodate the wearing of hearing aids with hard hats and eye protection?

I had a company buy the 3M Peltor hardhat earmuffs.

I wear IsoTunes Aware earbuds instead of my hearing aids. The “Aware” feature involves a mic that provides adjustable amplification (enough for me anyway) while blocking loud sounds.

[Here's a thing I saw on etsy the other day](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1167596569/hearing-aid-accessory-for-glasses?ls=r&amp;external=1&amp;content_source=3372c0914efc4a77418dee948b434460%253A082407f2949c43fa7bd32c0bbf7dd329a9c01ccf). One goes around the arm of your glasses, the other around the processor of the hearing aid, giving you more options to position the processor and hold them there. Might help you keep them out of the way of the hard hat rim!

Were you ever able to find something that works?  I’m dealing with the same issue now, I didn’t have any issues with my old Type I hard hat, but the suspension for the Type II safety helmets we’re required to wear now sits right against the mics on my hearing aids.",2025-07-23 20:10:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m7js7q/construction_industry_ppe_hard_hateye_protection/
1m7gy5d,hardofhearing,Early intervention for 4 month old,"My LO was diagnosed with single sided hearing loss in the right ear. Is early intervention worth it? Left ear is perfectly healthy and normal. Doctor has no concerns for speech and language development. Be brutally honest

[댓글]
I am a school-aged teacher for the deaf and hard of hearing, and early intervention is ABSOLUTELY worth it! not just for your child, but for the family. you would be surprised at how educationally impactful unilateral hearing loss can be. difficulties hearing in background noise, struggles with localizing speech, hearing what people say on the ""deaf"" side, just to name a few. with early intervention, you will learn strategies for teaching, communication, and advocacy. early intervention now may mean no or less academic intervention during school

&gt;Is early intervention worth it?

You say ""worth it."" What is it going to cost you or your 4 month old? What is it going to cost if there are speech and language development problems and you don't get early intervention?

The consequences of speech and language development problems can affect a child through their entire lives. That is not even considering other implications of having single sided hearing loss. SSHL can affect localization of sounds, it can reduce their incidental learning which is where babies pickup most of their language, and early interventions can help in identifying what educational supports the child may need when they do get to a school setting.

Early intervention identifies the struggles the child may face, and minimizes those impacts by coming up with a plan to support the student with, and educate the child on how to deal with those struggles.

Basically, ask yourself and your partner (if you have one) what are the downsides of accepting early interventions?

Yes. 1000% no question. EI is largely the child getting therapy with the therapist and the parents learning what to do between sessions to support their child's development. You will be getting tailored 1:1 support and advice. 

They will keep a more acute eye on development than a pediatrician would and can help direct you to resources specific for Deaf/HOH. If they have ASL classes, then I'd take them up on that too.

Well if drs have no concerns about speech or language that’s good. “Is early intervention worth it?” Obviously. Depending on the level of loss they will need a hearing aid. That’s can be challenging for very young kids as they don’t always want to wear them but hearing aids work best when worn the majority of the day. 


You will likely need to make their school aware so they can receive the proper support but honestly that’s way in the future

”He can locate sound” is totally irrelevant and why hearing people cause us so much pain and misery.

Hearing sounds does not mean the sound is clear nor that speech is easy to comprehend. You should rather be looking for if he communicates differently in quiet situations where he can see the speaker and the distance is close, compared to if he truly catches everything in social situations with a lot of overlapping speakers and background noise. People often asses our ability to hear by the first situation, while the second one is much much more important for our relationship with hearing people. 

Is he really as engaged in conversations when there is background noise, or do the conversations become shorter and not as deep? Does he become tired from listening? Do people accuse him for not paying attention? When our cognition can’t to the hard task of listening anymore, then we zone out and people think we’re nonchalant for not being socially involved. We can often hear things if we focus actively, but have lost the ability to listen passively and still comprehend sound.

Hearing aids can amplify sound, but not make the sound clearer.

With mild hearing loss, we often get by fine with hearing aids. We just get very tired from compensating and from the effort of listening.

With moderate hearing loss, there will be some occasions where we do struggle, but hearing people will believe things work fine, because we do hear well in quiet conditions at short distances with hearing aids.

With severe hearing loss, we do hear tons of things with hearing technology. But it’s too much sound. We hear everything, but it’s super hard to interpret anything. People still believe we cope well, because together with lip-reading and guessing, we seem so hearing to hearing people. In fact, we’re often weary excluded in social situations.

Never assess anyone by our hearing ability. Do compensate by a lot of visual communication regardless if it’s reading a lot or using sign language and similar. It’s great that we hear so much, but don’t have us compete with other based on our hearing ability. It’s not fair to say we hear fine, when we actually struggle to interpret what we hear.

I would agree with what others have said, sounds like your child is hard of hearing. It's easy for mild to moderate high frequency loss to fly under the radar during childhood, because they're likely not missing most speech sounds and they don't know certain things actually make sounds if they've never been able to hear those sounds. I have moderate high frequency HL that wasn't diagnosed until I was 12... I was just a quiet and anxious kid who talked a little funny and got overwhelmed in loud environments. People don't tend to associate those things with hearing loss. I didn't realize that ""birdsong"" wasn't a poetic way of talking about birds clicking (that's all I could hear them do), that bells are actually pretty loud, or that fans make any noise at all. It was assumed that my loss was due to antibiotic ototoxicity, since I had a long course of treatment for tuberculosis as a young toddler.

I don't know much about the frequency of adenoids/etc affecting hearing, but we did explore that possibility with my oldest child. They had hearing loss that our ENT thought was related to adenoids/eustachian tube dysfunction/recurrent ear infections, but after treating all of those issues a hearing loss very similar to mine remained. Then I had two more children, neither of whom had ear or adenoid issues, both with similar hearing loss from birth/very young. Now all of our HL is assumed to be genetic, although we've had genetic testing that didn't identify any of the most common genetic variants linked to hearing loss. Unfortunately sometimes we just don't have the knowledge or technology to figure out why the body does what it does.

All of that to say that you don't need to know exactly why your child has hearing loss to treat that hearing loss. I have big regrets for waiting to get my oldest hearing aids for as long as we did. There were years when they could have had much better language access, but we were advised to hold off to see if this surgery, that course of antibiotics, this additional surgery, etc fixed the issue. If I could go back I would have asked about HAs and incorporated more sign language immediately.

Please follow through with their recommendations for therapy and austerity devices, like a hearing aid. They are going to start school soon and there is so much more stimuli there. They will become exhausted, could have difficulty learning and socializing. 

I recommend talking with the hospital's social worker or looking up Deaf resources in your state so that you can start learning about supports, resources  and how to navigate 504 &amp; iep, should he end up needing one. 

Not following through would be like not giving it child glasses who failed a vision screening because they don't bump into things and can match colors.

I made it all the way to kindergarten before anyone noticed I had hearing loss. The reason likely is because interacting with your parents is different than in the classroom. Your parents are giving you 100% attention, looking right at you, etc. In the classroom I was put in the back because I was tall. There's so much other noise because of the other kids. It's just harder to hear in a classroom setting.



The good news is this probably means your child's hearing loss is correctable with hearing aids. I've been wearing them 40 years now, and the tech we have today is pretty amazing. Also make sure and get the insurance on them. They will get broken, dunked in water, etc.

Hearing loss is a spectrum. You son ""failing"" his hearing test means that his responses were below what would be considered ""normal"". The audiologist indicated that the loss is mostly in the high frequencies meaning that your son's hearing within the other frequencies may well be within the normal range (without an audiogram it is difficult to comment). You also do not mention the extent of his hearing loss is it mild, moderate?

Search for the speech banana and compare to your son's audiogram so you can get an understanding of the sounds he may have been missing and how he has seemingly been able to function without any outward indicators of HL. HL is an invisible disability and children are more resilient and adaptable than we think. I know of a family whereby the parents did not know their son was deaf in one ear until he was 10! Apparently, like your son, he was functioning seemingly normally. One day, by accident, they asked him to answer the phone using the other ear and that's how it came out! Their son thought everyone was deaf in one ear!

I also wonder what you are experiencing as a parent when you seek alternative explanations for your son's HL. Of course, it is good practice, if there are options out there you want them explored. Obviously it is a shock to you and your wife. How his diagnosis and experience with medical and other support professionals are managed will be key in your son being comfortable with his HL or not

I’m completely deaf in one ear (can’t use a hearing aid) and close to 30 years old, and it’s only been just recently that I’ve realized how much hearing loss does affect me. Because I still have one ear with total hearing, no one really looked into anything further because I could hear most stuff fine.

Your child can still be deaf or hard of hearing even if they still can hear most things. I really wish that there was more guidance for me growing up. I would have benefited so much if I wasn’t just thrown into the world as a “normal kid who might ask ‘what?’ a few times”. Sign language, subtitles, and just more understanding of the situation would have made an insane difference for me growing up. I’m just starting to take advantage of these things now and it’s made a world of a difference. 

When I started living on my own and used subtitles for the first time on a movie I’ve already watched and loved, I was amazed at how much I was missing that everyone else caught. Now when I’m watching a movie without subtitles, there is a clear difference in how exhausted I am. No wonder I’ve always been so burnt out after any event or social gathering - straining to listen is something I have to make an active effort to do, and it’s so draining. 

It’s also so isolating to be at a table of people and trying your hardest to listen to the conversation, but because you can’t hear them, you just smile and nod along having no idea what they’re talking about. The last time I visited my grandparent before he died, I could never hear any of his stories over everyone else also talking and laughing - and that’s something that really affects me to this day. Everyone else gets these lovely memories of my grandpa telling riveting stories, and I miss it even though I’m putting more effort into listening than anyone else at the table. I only hear about it down the grapevine from someone else, which isn’t the same. It’s very lonely when no one around you fully understands or tries to accommodate.  

Listen to your doctor, follow their guidance, and don’t try to convince yourself that your child is “normal” just because they can hear a majority of stuff that you do. Pretending like it isn’t an issue just makes the child feel isolated and unable to understand their struggles. There’s nothing wrong with being deaf, and giving your kid all the support and tools they need will help them tremendously!! Pretending it’s not happening doesn’t make your kid learn to hear better, it just makes things really difficult and confusing for them. 

Good luck on this journey and I hope you take some of the advice in the comments! I do applaud you for taking it seriously and continuing to go through the doctors and specialists even with your doubts. Your kid potentially being hard of hearing might be scary to you, but it will be normal for them. The sooner you come to accept this, the sooner they will be so much more comfortable and confident in themselves 💕

Caveat, not a doc: it's possible, but unlikely - your kid is probably hard of hearing. Some of the modern tests can tell the difference between an obstruction or fixable issue in the ear/nose/throat system and deafness, but this is something you need to clarify with the doctor. 

Deafness or hard of hearing-ness is a wide spectrum - you have people who have very minor deafness who function normally in 95% of situations, people who are hard of hearing and have issues with crowds but are otherwise fine, deaf people who can only hear via hearing aids/implants, and people who are 100% stone deaf. 

Based on what you're saying, your kid seems to be hard of hearing. Some folks are hard of hearing only at specific frequencies - I can't hear very low sounds but can otherwise hear most sounds with hearing aids, but I am more towards the deaf part of the spectrum.",2025-07-23 02:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m6xxpa/hearing_loss_in_children/
1m6sp5j,hardofhearing,Best smart glasses for hard of hearing in 2025,"I’ve very interested in smart glasses which display closed captions as a way to help me follow discussions.

Its early days but the field is rapidly evolving.

I’d be interested in any thoughts on the effectiveness of smart glasses for transcribing conversations in real time and what brands currently show the most promise.

Some like Google Glass will only display in the right eye but my dominant eye is left so I will need bimocular or left eye display.

As far as I know they're all way overpriced ( one-time payment ) or entail a subscription, or are collecting data about you and profiting somehow.


Most rely on good internet connection to provide  real-time captioning features. That can be its own or additional subscription.


I'm waiting for the tech to mature or fizzle out. When there's a smart glass that is one-time purchase, with offline functionality and again, no subscription nor data collection nor advertising, at a reasonable price, and a battery power system and weight that is practical, then I'll consider buying. At the moment, I'm not aware of anything on the market like that. Haven't been actively looking though, seems too soon for a balanced product.


I expect tariff shenanigans is sowing chaos in the tech and manufacturing world too.

1m6318m,hardofhearing,Can some doctors tell the difference between 'actual' hearing loss and Eustachian tube issues?,"I'm in my 40s and have had poor hearing on my right side since college.  Some days it's actually very good and some days it's much, much worse, and feels related to how 'full' my ear feels (e.g. Eustachian tube issues).  I've had a couple lame primary care doctors that just tell me my hearing is worse in that ear, and haven't let me see a specialist.

Is there a specialist that can actually tell if you have real hearing loss or if its from ETD?

I have never even had someone look into my Eustachian tube from the inside, I can't get approved/recommended for it.  So I'm considering changing doctors again.

[댓글]
I have had Eustachian tube dysfunction before I had hearing loss and the audiologists seemed to be able to pick up the difference. When I had ETD there was this pressure test they did along with the beeping and words in noise test. I just looked it up and it's called a Tympanometry test, which showed issues but I could hear all the beeps and words back then so they said I had ETD (was allergies for me mostly). They do different types of beep tests, like bone conduction ones too as well as playing the noises in your ears. 

Have you been to an audiologist or ENT?

any hearing loss is “actual” legitimate hearing loss, whether or not its temporary or permanent.  you would need to see an audiologist to have your hearing tested, as an ENT is more for ear health and less about determining your level of access

An audiologist can certainly tell by testing you what kind of loss. There’s Sensorineural hearing loss which is when the nerves of the inner ears are damaged and there’s a Conductive hearing loss which involves the Middle Ear including the Eustachian tube and the bones of the middle ear. Usually when you see an Audiologist you should also see an Ear Nose and Throat doctor who can tell you what treatment is best for your condition.

I've had similar issues and this is what I had to figure out from research since I couldn't exactly see doctors often.

The reason why it's difficult to get experts to agree if one is dealing with eustachian tube issues is this:

There's a good number of conditions that overlap similar symptoms eustachian tube issues. Things such as infections, wax buildup, allergies or sinus congestion, tmj, menieres disease, patulous eustachian tube, acid reflux affecting the larynx.

Which means there will be a need to eliminate each one to figure out which one it is from the order of most statistically likely and ease of confirmation to the most unlikely unless a new symptom shows or simply wait it out for the transient ones to pass (such as the seasonal allergies one).


I wish I could help but if you're dealing with anything similar to mine, knowing why helped me feel slightly less frustrated.

You should definitely see a specialist. I went into the office of an ear nose and throat specialist. My complaint was “I’m in so much pain I feel like I got in a boxing match with Mike Tyson in his prime”. I’d been in *severe* pain for 2 years and my dentist couldn’t find a source of the pain. In 5 minutes I knew I had temporomandibular dysfunction and had a list of tips on how to fix it before it was considered surgical. 10/10 would recommend a specialist for their field of study again.",2025-07-22 03:01:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m6318m/can_some_doctors_tell_the_difference_between/
1m4z89y,hardofhearing,"Left Ear Deafness for 3 years, worsening: Thoughts, Experiences, Support?","Hey r/hardofhearing, 

I wanted to talk with some people who may have had similar experiences and get some input and feedback.

About 3+ years ago, I initially had a period of deafness and severe tinnitus in my left ear. This happened during a time I was moving into a new house. I had recently been bitten and scratched badly my partner and I's cat (maybe 5-7 teeth punctures, several scratches). The year before I had come down with COVID, and then about a month after moving into the new house I was going through some serious stress due to a breakup. The deafness and tinnitus eased up and I only heard an infrequent humming until about three months later.

I was on a work trip a few towns over staying overnight in a hotel. This was early Spring. I woke up in the morning and my ear was so deaf/muted, tinnitusy and my balance was thrown off. I immediately got tested for COVID, did not have it. Went to the doctors and they gave me prednisone. This would start the beginning of pattern of deafness/muteness/severe tinnitus for about a week or so, then a couple month period of moderate/low deafness and low to moderate tinnitus. I noticed it would happen more during work trip travel, but other times seemingly at random. 

Between then and now, I've gone to multiple ENTs, seen specialists, tried nose sprays, ear drops, allergy medications, the OTC for ear ringing (which never helped and is a scam IMO). The only thing that seems to help is prednisone. But at this point I feel I take way too much prednisone (a 7 day course about every two months over three years) and this most recent episode the tinnitus was so loud and the deafness so deep it feels like besides the choir of alarm squeals and ocean sounds the whole left side of my head and the space after is in a void. I don't experience vertigo or balance issues, and it never hurts nor do I feel pain. No one has ever given me an answer why its occurring, what could be swelling inside my ear, nothing. Just to track when it drops on Mimi was what the specialist. 

The audiology test I took last week had my left ear hearing drop into the 60 row from the 75-80 range it had been at. I feel like soon I won't have any hearing at all in my left ear and frustrated that it's been so many years without more clarity. 

 I wanted to know if anyone's had similar experiences, thoughts and ideas or steps, and how people cope with and remain positive during moments of frustration with hearing loss. 

[댓글]
Something similar is happening in my left ear. It’s unexplained loss that will eventually make me fully deaf on that side. Unfortunately doctors will likely never be able to explain it to you and the prednisone is likely going to be the only thing slowing down the progression for you.",2025-07-20 20:30:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m4z89y/left_ear_deafness_for_3_years_worsening_thoughts/

Remote mic that the officiant wore during the ceremony and then toast givers wore during the toasts (each one passing it to the next when they finished). Worked great.

Can you get whoever is conducting the ceremony to sign as well? You could both sign your vows as well depending how well your fiancé is getting on with learning! 

Consider music/background noise throughout the day, perhaps have some areas without any that can be used for conversation away from dance floor etc. In general I’ll perhaps have a good friend on “standby” so if any loud background noise starts during any key moments they can do their best to intervene and shut it down asap for you.

The other big thing will likely be the speeches, make sure their voice is amplified and they are stood in the best position for you. No background noise (so pre-warn any staff this is not the time to do any noisy setup in the background).

I don’t have any good ideas but I’m hoh and getting married so here to see if I can use any as well 🖤 hope you don’t mind and congrats!!

I’m getting an interpreter to help assist with communication, my sister and another bridesmaid are also HOH/deaf, and I will have a couple of Deaf people in attendance so I may get another interpreter for them. An FM could be a possible tool for you to use.

1m3ygc3,hardofhearing,How did you know which hearing aid was effective for you?,"I’ve recently noticed some hearing loss (mostly in conversations and noisy places) and I’m starting to look into hearing aids. I’m honestly not sure what type I need or what to even look for.

How did you figure out which hearing aid was right for you? Did you go through an audiologist, or try OTC first? Any advice or things you wish you knew earlier?



[댓글]
My audiologist looked at my audiogram and suggested a couple of different options. They know what’s best for different types of hearing loss, as well as ear mold shapes. Since I have moderate to severe sensorineural loss, not all are the best choice. I can’t do RIC hearing aids for example. They’re too weak for my needs.

 I’ve had them since I was two, so I can’t speak much for the last question. My current pair, I knew that I wanted colorful hearing aids and colorful molds. I went over the couple of options my audiologist had, asked questions about features I wanted and just picked.

I went to an audiologist.  They did the hearing test and gave me some options to choose from.  (It was no pressure.) They then programmed them for my specific hearing loss.  

Initially (3 days) it was a bit overwhelming to know what I was missing and my brain was tired from processing it all. 

4ish months later and when I take them out to shower, it's like a cone falls on me to muffle sounds and I always think... whoa that's what it was like before and I didn't know.  

They're expensive and I'm not going to pretend they're not.  But I personally would not do OTC ones because they're like the reading glasses at CVS, just general amplifier and not for my specific needs. (Different people lose different word sounds like 'ch' or 'nt' different decibels.)

I was tested by an audiologist who found my hearing loss and then provided hearing aids that would work for me. How would  otc hearing aids even work?

you see an audiologist.

Work with an audiologist. There are lots of considerations that you won’t know about before you talk to a professional and try them. For example: skin colored HAs can be hard to find. On my fourth set I’m opting for bright colors. There are also benefits to people seeing you wear them. I am also prone to pressure headaches from glasses and hats, so I realized the over the ear kind of HAs don’t work for me. I’m thrilled to be going back to in ear canal when I pick my new pair up next week.

I went to my audiologist, tested a few models for 2 weeks each, and decided for the ones that suited my best.

But that is Germany, don't know how it works in America.

In Germany, we get some paid by public insurance, but they suck. If you want some good ones, you need to put some money on the amount the insurance pays. 

I should have invested some money for my last ones, because in the end they really were 

not helping me. And one of the downsides of the German health System is, that you have to wait 6 years for getting new money from the insurance. Which is way too long. 

So for you: Don't waste money on the things, 

My actual ones adapt to the surroundings automatically, I can set up my own hearing programs by smartphone and have Bluetooth, so I can listen music over the aids and makes phone calls.

Test different molds.

Check for follow-up costs: replacement parts, cleaning, repairs, insurance against breaking or losing them, stuff like that.

A couple of things. 
First check with an ent and audiologist. Sometimes you have to get a 2nd or 3rd opinion in my case bc some Dr's. Just dont give a shit. Thank God my mom fought to get me to be referred somewhere else 
2. Don't get OTC bc depending on how bad your hearing is could potentially make you hear that much worse. 
3. After seeing an audiologist, I could open up a few options: cross hearing aids, hearing aids for both, or in my case Cochelar Implant on my left and hearing aid for my right. 
4. Cost...yeah that's something to think about. Please Check with insurance and/or disability program to help pay. 2 of my doctors ( my neurologist and ear surgeon) had to write a letter to my insurance to pay for my surgery and hearing aid bc at first they didn't want to. I won't lie. it's not cheap. In my US state, for the whole ci and surgery was $405k and 4k for the hearing aid. My insurance paid for everything except part of the inital candidate visit. 
Heres why I hands down vote CI:
1. I can not only hear better as a whole but damn i can  actually hearing music, going swimming and hear ppl, and carrying on a convo without having to ask the person to repeat themselves over and over to the point im crying is a Godsend! 
2. You can choose to wear the ""wireless"" one no itchy  ears or the way it feels, no warbling sound...i can hear the damn birds and my kids! Sound is so much clearer and more refined no more raising up and down the volume bc of soft spoken people. Instead of asking a people at least 20x to repeat something, I can catch about 95% of what's said and either say it back or use context clues to figure it out. 

The longer you go without hearing the worse it gets. Your brain starts to forget what things are and sound like so the sooner you can get help the better!  Just something my audiologist said. ( context: I've got SLE and at 39 it's taken my hearing and a chunk outta my eyesight too) Good Luck

The only OTC hearing aid I have found useful is the Apple AirPods Pro 2.  They allow you to add your audiogram or take a hearing test through your iPhone.  The only issue with them is the battery life will not last all day.  I have had Phonak Audeo Paradise P90-RL behind the ear with receiver in canal and they were OK, but caused some discomfort due to also wearing glasses and hats almost day. 

I now wear the Signia Active Pro IX in the ear hearing aids and they are great. 

I wear my AirPods Pro 2 when I need active noise canceling (mowing the grass, etc.)

ENT + audiologist is the way to go if you’re new to this. It will give you a firm and dependable baseline.

The audiologist will most likely ALSO sell and fit hearing aids. You’ll pay a notable premium, but there is a lot of value to work with a live-in-the-flesh human over the first few months for the fine tuning.

The fine tuning will determine how happy you are with the quality of your renewed hearing. But for perspective, high quality hearing aids can be purchased online and well-supported via video calls. It’s definitely trickier, but possible if you’re comfortable with the tech.

I purchased 2 sets of aids in person (each set ~ $5k) and, now, 2 sets online (each set ~$2k). This is over the span of 13 years.

In person service was great, but more $ and time consuming. Online has really been terrific for me now that I know about the tech and what spec/features I need. The fine tuning is much easier via zoom.

I’m probably not getting The Very Latest tech (that’s reserved for the brick-and-mortar outlets), but the online has been a great solution for me with economy and ease-of-access to support.

As someone recently diagnosed with hearing loss, my best advice is to start small. Find out what level of hearing loss you have and know your options. I have mild hearing loss and cost was a concern (the idea of spending thousands of $$$ at an audiologist felt overwhelming to me) so I decided to try OTC hearing aids first. And I'm really glad I did. I went with audien ion pro and even though they're not as high-tech as custom ones, they're very reliable and easy to use. One thing I wish I knew earlier: just trying something can really help. I thought I had to figure everything out before doing anything but starting small gave me a better sense of what I actually needed.",2025-07-19 15:05:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m3ygc3/how_did_you_know_which_hearing_aid_was_effective/
1m3iz3r,hardofhearing,Rupture after tympanoplasty,"Hi guys, I had tympanoplasty about 3 years ago - I had repeat infections that caused the drum to rupture, it wouldn’t heal on its own due to size of rupture and that it kept getting infected (it was all fungal infections too which seems to be harder to get rid of in my experience).
I’ve had an ear infection this week and was pretty sure my drum ruptured two nights ago (sharp pain and then all the pain I’d been having the previous days was gone by the morning) and this morning I’ve woken to blood on my pillow (my ear has been so blocked I think it’s just come out). 

If it’s ruptured, what’s my chances of it healing without requiring repeat surgery? I’m kind of spiraling this morning because I don’t want to go through it all again, the recovery and also the cost (I was about $4k out of pocket). 
I can’t get into my doctor until Monday and the ENT until August, I’m assuming they will say we will have to wait to see if it heals anyway but it didn’t work for me last time 😭

If you are in the US contact the HR department and frame it as ADA compliance issue.  If they still don't do anything go higher in the food chain.  It isn't your responsibility to fix this.  Make sure you document when and who you are talking to and reference this list every time you talk to someone higher.  You will eventually get to someone who understands this is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  I would also discuss this with the dean of your college.  Again framing this as an ADA compliance issue referencing everyone and when you have talked to.  If nothing changes advise the school that you will not be repeating this, but rather will be exploring a legal remedy.  That should light a fire under them.  The key is to keep detailed records.  If you get a written warning make sure it is noted on the form somewhere that this issue is an ADA compliance issue and directly caused by a known health condition.  I worked in a hospital for over a decade.  I finally had to research and purchase my own volume controlled handset.  It was specific to that phone/system.  My advice is to look on the phone and research which brand and model it is.  Next type this information into your preferred search engine with amplified handset/headset or hearing aid compatible handset/headset.  They do exist, but tend to be specific to individual phones.  This is why general recommendations could end up not working.

I have significant hearing loss and when I started working at a call center, rehab services got me hearing aids that connect to the phones using Bluetooth. It was NOT my favorite job, but I stuck it out for two years and got my foot in the door to switch jobs within the organization. 

I have no idea what your job will require, but one thing I found helpful was to ask for numbers before asking for their names - is numbers, last digits of their soc, birthdays, etc. It's a lot easier to hear numbers than it is to hear names/letters. 

(edited - sorry, I just woke up and, after rereading, saw I misunderstood the bit about your counselor reaching out to the school)

I work in a call center.  I use Nagish on my cell phone to provide captioning.  At the same time, the phone is linked to my hearing aid so the callers voice is piped into my ear.  You may qualify for a free phone via Captel that shows transcribed calls in real time.  That would be easier to see than cell text.  Call your audiologist.  The phone is free from the government.",2025-07-19 00:12:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m3i99c/product_recommendation/

1m315pj,hardofhearing,"Found out that I'm HoH in early 30s, can't afford HAs","Hello everybody! 

Like the title says, I found out just before Christmas that I have mild/moderate hearing loss and am a candidate for hearing aids. I notice most of my hearing loss is conversational when there's background noise. Trying to have any type of conversation anywhere but a quiet room is exhausting. And even then, the tinnitus is overwhelming. 

My issue is that I can't afford the hearing aids. I'm in Canada and the hospital quoted me $4000. 

I applied for my provincial hearing aid program and was denied. My boyfriend makes decent money but has a mortgage and vehicle payment. The government takes his income into consideration for the program even though we've never claimed common law (apparently it goes by household income, not family income). 

Beltone quoted me at $2900+tax for their most basic set. 

I don't make enough to even try to save up for them. 

What do I do?? 

[댓글]
What province are you in? I’m in New Brunswick and found a local place that had government grants for hearing aid users needing them to be gainfully employed! Could try that route, if you have a local deaf and hard of hearing society they may have a lead on where you could go!

I don’t know much about Canada, but do you have a Costco? They don’t do the tinnitus masking there, but they sell really nice hearing aids for much less than most other places, worth looking into.

You need to find a way to save for them. There’s not really many other options. You can always try other providers of hearing aids but there’s no guarantee they will be cheaper. Look in to financial aid programs too

I've just bought the Apple Airpods for $400 (AUD). You can program them by uploading an audiogram and they will adjust the settings to account for your losses. Not quite as good as HAs but possibly a stopgap?

I don't know about Newfoundland but in BC I got my audiologist to complete forms for me stating that I needed hearing aids in order to work and WorkBC paid for all but $500 of them. I'm not sure if Newfoundland has an equivalent though? I did some googling and it looks like worksupportnl.ca might be helpful.

This may or may not work for you.  I've been HOH since grade school, so a looooong time.  During the times I didn't have government support or health insurance that would pay for them I bought used HA (Hearing Aids) on ebay.  While I am in the U.S. I don't see why you can't find them in Canada.  The only issue to be careful of in my experience is to make sure you have an audiologist who can program them for you.  I had to pay for the initial Audiogram and then the programming.  I purchased several for $50 to $75 US and then had them programmed.  That way I always had a spare.  Then I found a repair service that I could mail them to for refurbishment if needed.  That service was often more than what I initially paid for the HA.  Even if you do find a way to get a new one or pair of new ones it would still be a good Idea to keep a spare just in case.

If you truly are desperate you might consider using wireless earbuds as hearing aids. Sometimes good enough is good enough.

Yep your hearing is within normal range so you’re not hard of hearing (I’m actually kind of jealous it’s so good hahaha) and if you’ve been told the deviated septum is the cause of the issues then you should look into fixing that

1m2prbj,hardofhearing,help advocating for yourself,"I scheduled my third hearing test as an adult. I had a bunch as a child after dozens of ear infections and tubes. I was told I’m in the lowest 16th percentile for auditory processing when I saw a neuropsychologist after a brain injury. My hearing is causing severe issues in my life. My boyfriend is so sick of me not hearing what he says after three times. My whole office makes a joke out of my hearing issues. My friends have always joked about it too. I’m so frustrated. I keep getting told my hearing is fine and it’s literally not. I get sharp pains in my ear, the heavy ringing, sometimes a steady tone sound(?). I always try and pop my ears to make my hearing a tiny bit better but then everything is too loud and hurts. Is there anything I can do before my appointment to make the audiologist truly understand me? I feel like I’ve been fighting my whole life to just hear normal. I think this is my last time at really trying. I had sinus surgery this year and was already at the ENT every month which is how I got the courage to try again.

Write a list of your symptoms. Bring it in the appointment. Make sure you say everything on the list. Don’t downplay your symptoms.

Writing everything down is a great suggestion. It's easy to get flustered and forget, etc.

I'd say also write down exactly how it makes you feel, and how you struggle, because I had twenty years of hearing aids being turned up louder &amp; louder. I eventually saw a professor and at some point said ""no matter how loud the hearing aids get turned up, nothing ever gets any clearer"" - and that was like some magical sentence that unlocked a secret option to get a BAHA.",2025-07-18 01:48:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m2prbj/help_advocating_for_yourself/
1m2mpzf,hardofhearing,Middle ear exploration?,"I’ve been losing my hearing very slowly since 2016 and I’m 21 years old
I have a middle ear exploration consultation coming up and I’ve been given the option to go through with that.
If nothing is resolved or I choose not to go through with it I may receive hearing aids
Just wondering if anyone had any advice on the procedure? Or maybe on what I should do?

my journey was a little different, at 16/17 i noticed i couldn’t hear out of my left ear, and i found out i had a hole in my eardrum and a cholesteatoma (a skin growth/“tumor”) and it ate away all 3 of my middle ear bones. i had 2 surgeries, one to repair my ear drum and remove the growth, and with the second one they replaced my middle ear bones with titanium which was supposed to help me regain some hearing. i ended up needing a hearing aid anyway (there was a low possibility of me not regaining much/any hearing, but that’s what ended up happening in my case). i knew what was going on and what the plan was, but i was still nervous. my advice would be to go forward with the exploration, they could potentially find the cause and be able to give you options going forward. there’s always a chance with surgery or medical intervention, you could regain hearing. there’s also the chance that if you don’t have the exploration, you could keep losing hearing overtime. hearing aids would probably be a great option for you either way! for me its definitely not the same as normal hearing but it helps so much in almost every situation. i hope they are able to find a solution for you, good luck!

I had middle ear surgery 3 months ago.I knew I had a retracted eardrum and eroded incus but also struggled with the whether to do surgery or just get hear aides.  I did a hearing aid trial and hated them. Decided on surgery. Had a CT scan in my local small town ordered by my surgeon in the big city. The CT report stated that all my ossicles were present and fine. Boy that made me confused. Went ahead with the exploration surgery and we were all surprised and what was found. My surgery was twice as long as planned. My eardrum had grown onto my facial nerve (chorda) and grown onto my stapes. My incus was completely gone. I have a titanium incus, bio design eardrum with a cartilage graft from behind my ear. The surgeon told me if I had not done the surgery it would have become much worse. My follow up yesterday showed hearing improvement in the mid range frequencies but the high frequency remained the same. I notice better hearing and sound location. After 3 months I finally got to go swimming (no diving) and it was pure heaven!!! I have to have follow up MRI scans to make sure nothing grows back. My surgeon said he wants all scans done in the big city.not my hometown because of the quality of the radiologist reading them. Hope that helps you decide. I do have nerve damage. Half of my tongue has no feeling or taste and the end of it has a burning/pins and needle sensation. Hoping it might come back. It is reasonable to get a second opinion.

Little update! Turns out I could have SCDS
I’m having CT and Vestibular testing to diagnose!
And if all is good and correct I suppose…I’ll be having surgery to correct!
Any tips are appreciated…very nervous

Update! Finally have closure!
I have Otosclerosis in both ears…waiting to be scheduled for surgery on my right one and will probably need surgery on my left one later on in life

1m2kbpl,hardofhearing,Explant after Infection,"

I have AB Naida Ultra Hi Res 3d 90 on the left side and had the Phonak Link M hearing aid on the left. It has been life changing but I decided to get the right side done.   During this new  implant surgery one lead went into semicircular canal. Of course we did not know that at the time. I had to use a walker because my balance was much worse. But ok. I’m old!  Went for activation and when my wonderful audiologist started to turn up the volume I shrieked and nearly fainted. Oh boy, everything stopped. No activation. Surgeon immediately ordered CT.   Had revision surgery. Incision started to drain almost  immediately the next day. Staphylococcus aureus infection. Doc tried to treat with Bactrim for six weeks. Still on it. He tried packing gauze/ antibiotic and debriding , still there. He said we could continue to try. I have felt sick, sweaty, weak this whole time. I said no. Let’s pull it. Surgery is tomorrow, then IV antibiotics 4-6 weeks, or more (haven’t seen that doc yet), maybe wait to heal )I don’t know), then hopefully reimplantation.

Btw, he thinks he will have to “ just pull the magnet” as cochlear is fine”, but after reading someone else post about the cochlear being infected (discovered during surgery) I’m going to make sure that he knows I want it all pulled if there is any indication that the cochlear area is infected.

Any advice? How will he know if cochlear part is infected?? It’s so CLOSE to my infected incision?   I’m scared. ",2025-07-17 21:44:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m2kbpl/explant_after_infection/

Honestly don't let it get you down. Being hard of hearing is one of those invisible disabilities, and it's easy for others to just assume you got it. 

Yeah it sucks and it's crappy of them to make that assumption, but unless you speak up and be 'that guy that says 'what' all the time', you're gonna have this happen more often than not, sadly.

It’s helped that I developed a willingness years ago to be the person who asks questions in an Explain it Like I’m 5 kind of way. Or, if I’m learning how to do a new thing, likes to take step-by-step notes. Here, I’d probably respond with something like, “hey, I saw that Project X was finished. I’m not up to speed yet on how it works, so it would be helpful for me if you would be willing to share your knowledge and experience and guide me through it next time.” And archive the request, in case a supervisor calls you out on it.

This happens with every professional who is hard of hearing. I am one such fellow myself. It's so frustrating being left out of office conversations, and people simply don't bother. It's not their fault - their social conditioning is like that. In this age of cutthroat competition, people have lost the human touch. Everyone is busy looking after their own interests, or rather, I must say, they are compelled to do so by the way things are.",2025-07-16 09:08:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m17sor/took_a_shot_at_my_confidence/

(Over the past year) and one of the biggest issues I've had is directional sound in video games.

[댓글]
Newer video games generally have more accessibility options to help hh and deaf players.

I figured out how to turn mono audio on windows but if anyone has any programs or tips that would be amazing!

On Linux I uses easyeffects, on android I set balance to one side and use mono audio. 

Unfortunately, most FPS games do not include a visual audio indicator.  Fortnite does, so that's cool.

I know it sucks, man.  I had to give up Apex, was just too frustrating.  I play more RTS type games now.

Equalizer APO on the pc.

Take your latest audiogram and ask chat gpt to work it into a hearing curve for APO without peaking or clipping. It's time consuming but once you're set it, it'll adjust the audio for you. 

Not a perfect solution by any means, and takes a huge amount of tweaking, but once it's done, it's done and overlays that on top of any audio coming out of your computer. This adds challenges if it's a shared computer though, because it runs always.",2025-07-15 21:30:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m0uf47/solutions_for_directional_hearing_in_games/

I regained hearing and all that stuff. compared to my other ear, I still don't hear at the same level. I don't really know where to go from here lol?? I've gone back to the surgeon who did it multiple times and the last time might've been in May and he said it healed perfectly. so what do I do now? 😭

[댓글]
There could be built up scar tissue (from past infections/trauma or surgery) that is causing the hearing loss.

I think that's just how you hear now

Did the doctors say that it could bring hearing back because when I went for a consultation they said it would just stop my constant infections but not do anything hearing wise , was this the case for you?

i had a tympanoplasty and a surgery to removed a cholesteatoma that ate away my middle ear bones. they repaired my ear drum and gave me titanium middle ear bones. this was supposed to help me regain some hearing, but i regained so little it wasn’t even noticeable. i now wear a hearing aid in that ear. this could be a great option for you! it definitely isn’t “normal” hearing but it does help a lot in situations.

I have done myringoplasty on May. My hearing improved but not the same. doctors told me that it could be because of my existing condition. He asked to wait for 3 more months and see how it goes. Now my hearing reduce a bit than just after surgery. I am glad that there is no infection.

1m05e8c,hardofhearing,"Idk what to do, I’m going crazy","I think I'm broken or something. I've gone to two ENTs and had two appointments with the audiologist over three years. Nothing helps. Sure, I've learned to somewhat ignore the constant tinnitus in my ears but the pain is still there. Every day it randomly feels like something sharp is poking into my eardrum, and it hurts so bad. My ears always feel clogged like I'm on a plane, and music is almost always either too loud or muffled for me. Sometimes I feel dizzy (but it's not awful nor is it often). It gets worse when I have a cold. 

There is no fluid in my ears. My hearing is fairly normal (some minor hearing loss but nothing major). Took a scan of my head a couple years ago, that came out fine as well. 

I've stopped complaining about it at this point. I don't want to look like I'm making excuses to not do anything (I don't do that btw, but I've been feeling so drained lately). I even feel depressed from this madness, it's indirectly affecting my whole mood. I was completely fine three years ago, but then it suddenly started and never stopped. My mom offered to take me to the ENT again next week, I asked her what's the point? She's just going to tell me the same thing again, that I'm fine and to just take some Tylenol whenever it hurts. There is literally nothing wrong with me, but I'm in pain and I feel like a burden, a crazy person causing unnecessary stress to my family. 

I hate this so much. I'm a licensed scuba diver but I'm unable to enjoy diving because equalizing my ears feels like torture sometimes. I want to go to metal concerts without being in hell afterwards. I want to carry my baby sister and comfort her when she cries without feeling pain from the sound of her voice. My own mother's high pitched voice hurts my ears so easily and I feel like a terrible person for it. 

I hate this so much. I just want an end to this. Sometimes I feel like just putting some sort of vacuum into my ears and sucking whatever is causing me discomfort out.

Edit: I have TMJ!!!

[댓글]
Sorry to hear this. Sounds awful. I am no ENT and you should search for one that will work with you constructively (maybe one with dive medicine experience), but this sounds a lot like my earlier days with Eustachian tube dysfunction. Equalizing was intensely painful and I couldn’t always do it. (Now that I have 40 years of etd behind me, they just don’t work anymore and I don’t have to equalize.) I dreaded flying.

I also did scuba and with my ear history it was a really dumb move. Busted my eardrum once descending without being able to equalize. You might have already had ETD or been predisposed towards it and repeated equalizing messed up your tubes a bit.

Don’t sleep on possible ETD, it can really mess your ears up. Just my thoughts 🤷‍♀️

First off, that totally sucks and I'm so sorry. Not exactly the same thing happened to me. My first 2 ents and first audiologist were like yeah your deaf, bye. My mom got me referred to someone else, and she worked extra hard, and it's amazing of where i am now. After lots of testing with many doctors, I found i had lupus, and it's what caused all my issues. I'm not saying you have it per se, but everything you're saying was what I was going through at the beginning of my hearing loss. Some questions that might be able to think about:
Did you hear a loud pop or two in the beginning of all this? Like when you hold your nose and breath and your ears pop only, but it's the loudest you've ever heard it! Does it sound like people are talking in your head, and no one is there? When you are underwater, do you feel like you're leaning to one side more? When you lay down on your bed, do you feel like you're falling, but you're already lying down? Yes, to any of these, tell a neurologist and get a new Ent, please. I kick myself in the butt for not getting even a 3rd opinion bc hearing is so important not just to hear but balance of walking too! I love swimming and i miss going by myself. Im now stuck wearing a hearing aid and had to get an implant, too. I have to have someone with me when I go swimming it suuucckks. We water people want to be in the water. If the water pressure is hurting you, that's also a big red flag, so like i said, see a neurologist. For the meantime, what I did is take was something for the swelling. Yeah, it's your ear drums swelling...its nuts. My dr gave me some presidone...ik that sounds weird, but presidone damn that sh*t cut the noise almost completely or at least to where I could at take it. So please ask your doctor. Ik the feeling where every noise or in my case it was and sometimes still is a baby crying+jazz band playing+ train chugging along+ voices in my head have full on convos all at once all day and all night. So i get it, and I really hope you get some relief and rest soon. That damn tinnitus causes so much crap where you feel like you're gonna pull your hair out. Sorry for the rambling but I hope this gives you more direction or something to think about! Good luck and wishing you luck!",2025-07-15 01:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m05e8c/idk_what_to_do_im_going_crazy/

This is so sweet 🥹 Kudos to you for reaching out for help ❤️

I’m a person who has been hard of hearing from birth, it’s hereditary in my family. 

The KEY piece of advice to you is to be patient. Patience is a golden skill to someone with hearing difficulties. 

I found a post on Facebook just the other day that outlines many things that are helpful to someone with hearing difficulties. I can’t seem to attach photos in this sub so I’ll DM them to you. 

You could also suggest learning sign language together if that’s something that interests him. Despite being HoH my whole life, I’m only now learning sign language in my mid-30s. Mostly in case my hearing gets worse or to supplement conversations.

Give an extra second of breath between phrases. It helps the auditory processing have a moment to catch upb(the game of madgab we have to play in our heads to make what we DO hear make more sense). Just between every sentence or two take a big breath. I have a red yellow green light system with my husband. The day changes on how stressed my brain is when I can be quick with madgab and when it fails. So having a degree of hearing established when you get in the door from work will help set expectations for the day and ease frustrations. And I would insist on at least a handful of signs for when everything is going wrong with hearing. ""Help"", ""leave alone"", ""love you"", ""thanks"", ""sorry"", ""annoy"", and the suffixes for ""future now past"". Because when I'm over stimulated or my husband's ADHD is frustrated with me:  ""stop it annoying"" . ""I want to be alone"" . ""help hungry"" . ""again"" . ""I'm done"". All are very helpful in knowing if we need to try another route to get answers or leave and come back to it.

The reason he didn't learn sign language is because his speech therapy and hearing education focused on being able to learn how to function in real life with anyone. My case was similar, I was born with bilateral hearing loss and I was never taught sign language. I can listen with my headphones and talk to people, although sometimes just listening is a little difficult. In your boyfriend's case, it would be best to adjust the power of his cochlear implants. I don't think I want to learn sign language right now, but that's just a very personal opinion. And for your part, speak clearly and slowly, with a lot of patience. It's a team effort and I admire your desire to help your boyfriend, it's a very noble task!

Have you talked about it with him? There are lots of best practices. Get his attention, face each other, make sure he can see your mouth to read lips to help his mind confirm which sounds you're making, etc. He might have more tips. Be patient. Some people are more willing to put in the extra effort than others.

Ask him what he find easier and prefers as it can differ from person to person. For example some people would rather you motion to get their attention than tap them.

Nobody learned in my family and while I would like to, others don't. So that's up to him. For us, it's a lot of patience. For example, to speak to me you have to wait for my attention to be on your face since I'm a lil reader. I won't do well if you talk from my side or behind me or across the room. Worse in groups.

Your post is partially about hearing and speech, specifically what viable options are available and also about relationship of how to tackle a problem to ensure that you two can be happy together.  I think, from the relationship question perspective, you sitting down with him and share what you wrote here is the first step.  Then, work together to find a viable solution that works best for you.  And if he wants to pick up sign language as a solution, that is fine.  
I don’t think your bf wants to be told of what solution he needs, but I am sure he is willing to find a good solution, either on his own or together with you, once he acknowledges your genuine concern.  He likely has been told so many times of what he needed, throughout his life, and the last thing he needs to be told one more thing of what he needs.  Just a thought.

The most important thing is to make sure you are asking him what works best for him, and that you follow what he suggests.

General things to be mindful of include facing him when you are talking to him, not covering your mouth, and getting his attention before beginning to speak.

Also, if he asks you to repeat, focus on clarity, not just volume.

Discuss this with him first, to make sure it applies, but I personally need someone to repeat things the same way the first time, because I’m usually trying to fill in a blank in what they said, and the cadence helps me know what’s missing.

I will usually repeat back what I heard and say “what” or “who” in place of the part I missed.

Like “You went to the park and did what with who?”

If you try a couple of times and he doesn’t get some part, try saying it in a different way entirely - but don’t go straight to that, most things can be deciphered as originally spoken for most folks, and it’s abundantly frustrating for me not to be given the chance to solve the puzzle lol.

May we all get considerate partners like you! Thank you.

I’m 39 years old I was born in 1986, my parents didn’t realize I was deaf until I was 3 years old and never thought of putting me in A.S.L ( American Sign Language) so I had to learn oral
Communication which was and is still hard for me to speak and say the words properly until I got to around 25 years old and this is 4 years with my wife at the time gf  I started learning sign language and teaching my girlfriend what I learn in A.S.L class as I go and at first I didn’t realize how hard it was on her to communicate with me until she told me. If he really love you and want to build the relationship more I suggest you talk to him about either him 
Or you to go to class and learn and teach each other over the course and that my best advice to you and I hope it helps! :)

At your age, no one is stopping you from learning to sign. Start yesterday. Just do it. It won’t solve anything right away, but you’ll learn invaluable things about communication.

You definitely should persuade him to learn sign language. I know sign language, but I don't use iir as much becauae I read lips.   I have been hearing impaired for most of my life..

Couples therapy is the way to go!!! Check out [Deaf Counseling Center](https://www.deafcounseling.com)

Just a gentle correction: it's hard of hearing, not ""hearing impaired."" That's considered something of a slur in the Deaf world because it focuses on what they don't have rather than what they do.

You should see an audiologist and ent

You said you are in school?  If it is still highschool or earlier go to see the guidance counselor or school nurse.  The district may have resources or be able to put you in touch with government resources that will provide these services at no cost to you or your family.  This has been 40 or so years ago, but when I was in grade school my school district sent me to an audiologist and eventually the state paid for hearing aids even though my family had good insurance.  The school district was where it all started though.  If you are in college go through student health services if it is available.  I would also start asking your friends if they can put on the closed captions instead of turning up the volume.  It is really telling when you find out who will do it and who won't or makes a big deal of it.

My ear canals and eardrums are super clean also, but I have a hereditary hearing loss. Mine was detected at a very early age from an audiologist. I knew my hearing would decrease over time. I am now severe to profoundly hard of hearing. See an audiologist and it can determine the level of your hearing loss. Did this just happen recently, or has your hearing been decreasing over time?

It can be so many things. For example I have a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. Not saying this is you, but definitely go to an audiologist and take it from there.

Did the health care do a hearing test? You definitely should get one.

I know this doesn't answer your question, but instead of asking them to turn up the TV, ask them to put on subtitles! 

Also as others said, you need to see an audiologist.

go to a specialist. i noticed pretty significant hearing loss in high school, my family doctor noticed a hole in my ear drum and sent me to a specialist who discovered a cholesteatoma (skin growth) that ate away my middle ear bones, causing the hearing loss. they should be able to give you answers and any necessary next steps!

1lyiq3o,hardofhearing,What are the biggest issues you deal with as a consequence of not hearing/ mishearing key information in situations?,"As someone with hearing loss, it frustrates me that there will always be this biological gap that prevents us from fully hearing key information, leaving us more vulnerable that people without hearing loss. I have some ideas about how to help fill that gap, but want to make sure that I am addressing the biggest vulnerabilities/ problematic situations other people with hearing end up in as a consequence of not hearing or mishearing key info in situations. 

  
What are the biggest vulnerabilities/ problematic situations you end up in as a consequence of not hearing or mishearing key info in situations? How often does that happen or what has been the worst situation? Why? When does it happen? What do you think could've been done to prevent things from getting worse?

Not being able to follow conversations in groups. The choices are:

(1) Let it go, and you won’t understand what the conversation was about; or, when everyone bursts out laughing, you’ll have no idea why. (You’ll hear the punchline and find it unfunny, because you missed key parts of the setup.)

(2) Keep interrupting the speaker to ask them to repeat what you didn’t hear, and end up annoying everyone.

- Bike bells
- Smoke alarms
- Missing/overhearing gossip and embarrassing yourself
- Platform change announced, missing your train

I recently took a long haul flight. First thing I did was go to a cabin crew member and explain that I am hard of hearing and that I have trouble understanding public announcements so in the event of ermergency, someone would need to come to me.

I have also done the same in different situations. Like my bus will terminate unexpectedly somewhere I am unfamiliar with and I did not understand the announcements made about this. Some things are about self-awareness just like people with ""normal"" hearing. So if someone with normal hearing is wearing noise cancelling headphones and going down a busy street, the things they can do to maximise their safety: walking on the side facing traffic, if at zebra crossing then wait until the green man shows or remove headphones as well as look.

I used to cross the street without waiting for the green man. But I once was waiting at a very busy intersection and someone on a bike just flew by and crashed into the person next to me. Well, into their small suitcase (the noise it made was sickening) but this made me aware of the gap between seeing/hearing. So I may not always be able to see oncoming vehicles so now even though I see people crossing or there seemingly are no vehicles coming through, I still wait until the green man shows. I feel silly but I know why I am doing it.

I can usually hear the pitch of fire alarms but I am also aware that there may be fire alarms in some places that I may not be able to hear. Depending on the circumstances, I may have a discussion with someone about this (like work).

But part of being hard of hearing is becoming more aware of people's body language. When I am out and about, it is more about being constantly alert as to how people around me are behaving which gives indications as to what is going on.",2025-07-13 03:19:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lyiq3o/what_are_the_biggest_issues_you_deal_with_as_a/
1ly153g,hardofhearing,A genuine question,"Edit- I am doing a ton of research whilst doing this, I found Deaf Advocates but still need to learn more.

I am not Hard of Hearing or Deaf. I live in Rochester, with the Highest number of Deaf/HoH people in the country. Last year I was going to College for ASL, but realized that being an interpreter is too precise for me. What I did find was a deep respect and admiration of that community and a rage at how the world has treated people in it. Especially kids.

So I redirected my thoughts, and now I am going for Human Services Associates degree ( To start) and aim to help that community as best I can. Not in a hero way, but in a human way. I will be taking Asl classes, to afford at least basic communication and will be doing my best to help as best I can.

I am telling you this for advice. Are there things to avoid, encourage, studies that are great helps... I want to make a difference and really help. Your community is one that deserves that respect, so I aim to do my best.

Thank you for anything you can do to help, even if that is to direct me to a better Reddit to post this on.

Edit- It was pointed out that I wasn't being really direct, so here is the question-

My question is this- How can I be the best advocate, especially for Deaf/HOH children? I want to help kids get access to good educations, job potential and more. I want to make sure they are literate and able to advocate for themselves as well. They deserve and equitable playing field and I think I can help with that. So, I ask, how can I get started in a way that really does good and is wasting no one's time?

Thank you.

P.S. I will go for my bachelors, but I learn much better with field work than just classwork...

Edit- I really am not trying to be a hero, I know from personal experience how demeaning and unhelpful that is... I just want to do some good for a community that i respect a lot. Thank you.

MAJOR EDIT0

I am not thinking ASL is a basic language, all Sign Languages are beautiful, complex and well developed. What I was trying to explain is that i cannot simcom, that is too precise for me. The wires cross and that is a huge part of interpreteting. I am far too aware that it is not enough to have basics, I even said I was going to continue to learn more ASl and Deaf Culture in college, I live in Rochester, the resources are there.

I have only one semester of ASL skill, I want to have far more before i enter the work force. This is why I am asking for help, so I know precisely how to make the most out of my time so I CAN be the best fit for this community. I have time, that is the point.

To be concise, my goal is to take my four Human services courses per semester and then an Asl elective to round it out. This includes deaf studies... I am not taking this lightly.

I hope to be the best fit to help those I respect and can see myself being a good help... this is not a light goal. I am going all in. Heck I want to take ASL course in my bachelors as well...

The reason I am getting my Associates first is to get into a Deaf led organization and get my feet wet, to keep my skills up and more. Signing as part of my job, working in that community would be paramount ot mastering the language and understanding the culture.

One thing I can share with you is that people who have lost their hearing later in life (versus congenital) sometimes, if not always… go through the five stages of grief. Which includes anger, denial, bargaining and eventually hopefully acceptance. And it can be soooo isolating, leading into social isolation.

1lxogr3,hardofhearing,Can hear high frequencies but can't hear with background noise.,"Is it possible to have hearing loss but only for when there is background noise? I (31F, Australia) have very good hearing for high frequencies e.g. can hear the noise of bird deterrence machine that most adults can not hear however when there is background noise like at a busy restaurant and someone is talking to me I struggle to hear.

I did one of those free hearing tests that shops that sell hearing aids do a few years ago and my hearing was fine. It isn't ear wax as having my ears cleaned doesn't make a difference. I am Autistic and have adhd so wonder if it's a sensory processing issue rather than a hearing issue. I'm not sure if I should spend the money getting a proper hearing test or not as if it's just a sensory processing issue there isn't much you can do about it.

i suggest speaking to your audiologist. people will say CAPD, but autism can have its own issues with perceiving sound, and CAPD is when there's another clear cause (ie, head injury) or no autism involved. an audio can check you out some and refer you. there's also a chance you're missing a specific frequency.

1lwvf28,hardofhearing,Office job - Help me think of a sign to tell people I’m HOH!,"I'm HOH with a cochlear implant and accepted an office manager job at a elementary school. In order to streamline the efforts of all involved, I want to get a little sign made (think a name plate sign) that will go on my desk that tells people to speak clearly and look at me when they speak to me - but I want it to say it with pizzazz and personality, just not sure how haha! 
I'd love to hear any suggestions! 


[댓글]
The sign at my desk has the HA symbol. It says “Hearing aids in use. I’m probably listening to _____.” Then I have a whiteboard marker to write in showtunes, metal, whatever audiobook, etc. In my office, it’s common for people to wear headphones most of the time.

Canva! 

You can create your own for free super easy.
Then you can just throw it in a picture frame or one of those acrylic paper display things (i think it’s technically also a picture frame too but like, they also hold signs a lot and can sit on a desk)

Idk what yours needs to say but [here](https://postimg.cc/XGRL3Xzf) is a super quick example of how Canva works. You can add flair and personality to it but if you want people to read it you want it to be simple, bold, and eyecatching with direct words and commands. 

(Also, I recognize that people have mixed feelings about saying they read lips to hearing people because it can lead them to think that English can be read on the lips but at the same time I find it’s the most effective way of getting people to face me when they speak. If I say “please face me and don’t cover your mouth when you speak” they will forget. If I say “I need to read your lips” more often they do everything right.)

I wouldn’t complicate anything, since hearing people often misunderstand. Focusing on what you want them to do is totally right.

I saw a number of signs on Amazon while searching ""hard of hearing"" a while ago. You might get some ideas there - or even just buy one.

When I had a private office, I was notorious for writing on the glass with dry erase marker, any inane thing. But one thing I did write was ""Can't hear you"" and those that knew laughed and learned quick to wave their hands if I was deep in the monitor doing office-ey productive things.

Create your own ""I'm deaf,  this is how to communicate with me"" card at https://rnid.org.uk/get-involved/create-a-personalised-digital-communication-card/

Maybe a nice visual of someone speaking to someone's back of head with a red X through it and then another one where they are facing each other with a green checkmark. 

If you want to get more in-depth, maybe a red X over a graphic of the person looking downward while talking or other ways that the mouth can be covered. Perhaps even an exaggerated drawing of a person holding a piece of paper in front of their mouth.",2025-07-11 02:29:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lwvf28/office_job_help_me_think_of_a_sign_to_tell_people/

Except for two friends I manage to meet once a month at my place, I'm basically completely socially isolated. I try to visit my family more often to balance it, but it's obviously not the same. 

I started testing hearing aids today. In my home country they're super expensive and health insurance covers basically nothing. The ones I'm testing right now are already stretching my budget a fair bit. 
I went to a club meeting to today to try them out. I came home crying. I understood what was being said in the group discussion but as soon as everyone is talking amongst them self I'm out. 

I don't know what to do. It's like I'm being forced the choose between financial stability and having a social life. I've already been struggling with my mental health before any of this started, but the current situation is obvious only making things worse. I'm also waiting for a formal ADHD diagnosis and supposed to go on an exchange semester in Asia in September.

Our team is developing a new type of hearing aid tech that uses a different approach to filter out that background noise and focus on the person you're talking to.

To make sure we're building something that actually helps, we need to hear from people with real-world experience. That's where you come in. We've put together a short, anonymous survey that takes about 2-3 minutes to complete.

I'm not fully sure of your question but I wouldn't use chat gpt. It doesn't actually know information. It's not like a research librarian or something. It literally just knows what words tend to show up next to each other on the internet and spits them out at you based on that. It also is incredibly bad for the environment, like scary cartoonishly so.

ChatGPT actually has too little information on our issues. I learn from more experienced Deaf/HoH. It’s so important to get a network and role models. (We need to look for that ourselves, unfortunately.) Associations for HoH and Deaf Clubs are one place to look. I would be vary of hearing professionals, but sometimes they might know some things.

Also, trust your gut feeling about what will work or not. Don’t be afraid of experimenting.

My suggestion is becoming your own coach. 

I have been hyper self-aware especially navigating situations. ChatGPT is just a tool, but one that I use frequently. 

What I suggest from experience, is have a journal. I did this for a good month, writing down all social situations happening and how I felt about them. This revealed my pre-, intra- and post-thoughts when socializing (i.e. at work). 

I assume, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's mostly about talking to people?

1ltx2sj,hardofhearing,Baby cry transmitter - Australia,"I'll start this post with an apology, none of the people involve in my question are deaf nor have any reduction in their hearing abilities. Hear me out. Oh and I have searched this sub and read the wikipage. 

I'm a parent to twin toddlers. Some of the medication I take at night sedates me, so I am basically knocked out. My wife is who primarily tends to our babies. We've had an impossible time with their sleep, so it's not uncommon for my wife to get 2-3 hrs of sleep at night.

The babies currently are each in their own room. Both their rooms share a wall with ours - we're not fat at all. We have 2 different monitor systems, which should be enough. But the stars have aligned a few times, both have failed, and we've woken to the horrific realisation that our babies have been crying, and we did not hear them. No shade to people who sleep train; it's simply not in line with our values. 

Last year, when they were newborns and I was working and up doing feeds too, we found in our exhaustion, we kept turning off alarms on our phones, but had no recollection of this. I can't remember how I came across is, but I ended up buying an old Bellman &amp; Symfon clock and bed shaker and it was a blessing. No more missed alarms. Now that the babies are in their own room (I say babies, they're both &gt;12mo old), we need something that alerts us **reliably** that they need us. 

I'm aware B&amp;S have a baby cry transmitter + receiver system. The 2 x baby cry transmitters + the flash receiver would cost us AUD $962 which is crazy expensive. The wiki page listed other makers like Clarity, bebcare, Sonic Alert, and Serene innovations. Most of these are not available here. 

I'm hoping fellow Aussies can comment on what they use? maybe the B&amp;S is worth the steep price, or maybe there are alternatives we've not considered.

Having a conversation in a loud inviroment is very difficult.  That's my major setback.

What problem do you think we have with situational awareness that isn’t super easy to solve? The only problem I have is getting hearing people to understand what it is like to to be HoH/Deaf - and then actually do something that facilitates communication instead of the usual opposite. It’s the social aspects of hearing people only accepting speech as communication that is a problem, now situational awareness. With hearing aids, there are no problems hearing sounds, the problem is interpreting what you hear. Music becomes more a blended mess of noise, instead of being interesting as it should be, and voices are incomprehensible as soon as there is background noise, distance to the speaker or you don’t see the speaker clearly. Your idea doesn’t help with that at all.

I have a hard time localizing/targeting sounds. Sometimes I can’t tell which door is opening, or who and where someone is walking around and/or talking. Especially as a sewing enthusiast I often have to stop sewing or cutting fabric to confirm there is in fact a noise/voice and then engage with it (especially since I do not enjoy the oddly specific sounds that come with sewing while wearing hearing aids).

Are you making a version of head worn lidar?   


I'm SSD and it's frustrating locating sounds.  I do not wear a cross aid because it actually makes the location slower and more compromised.  It's hard to explain.  But imo useless for playing sports. 


Some advice, build your thing don't worry about the start up bs.   Worry about that after you have something real.

Someone trying to get my attention to talk to me by using their voice since they refuse to flash the lights or text me or use their voice since “walkie-talkie” on the iPhone / Apple Watch. 

I agree with the cars above when walking on the road or sidewalks. 


— — — — — — — — — — — 

Something that could vibrate, maybe using different haptics sequences depending on the sound type or direction or speed or distance?

like many others have mentioned my biggest struggle is understanding people in crowded spaces especially if there's a group, people are looking away, mumbling, facial hair etc... Im a runner and I'm currently training for a half marathon, so recently my biggest struggle is hearing cars and knowing which direction they are coming from when crossing a street (I end up swivel-heading a lot and getting honked at haha) I feel relatively safe and my family/friends have been really great about accommodating me especially in group settings. I'm really intrigued by this and appreciate your kindness!! 

(quick note/opinion to the general hoh and deaf community, if someone you're hanging around/giving your time to won't do the decency of making sure you understand them/feel included, you deserve better, that's bare minimum!!)

Personally, I dream of a device that tells me if a car is approaching. 

I don’t drive. I walk almost everywhere, including to and from work every day. This is particularly dangerous because my most severe hearing loss is in the low frequencies so it’s hard for me to hear cars, even when I’m wearing my hearing aids. Some cars sound too similar to my roaring tinnitus to discern whether it’s an approaching danger or the noise I’ve been trying to ignore all day and night for the last twelve years. This isn’t always a problem when I’m crossing a road that allows me to see traffic in both directions because I can rely on my vision to see what’s coming and know when I can cross safely. Unfortunately, I am sometimes required to cross blind intersections, such as T-intersections where the through road is tightly curved. Even worse, such an intersection with signs that instruct drivers to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk but they can’t see me either until they come around the curve and are too close to stop, let alone slow down. I am required to risk crossing one of those almost daily. It feels way too much like Russian Roulette. Little wonder I fight anxiety to just leave the house sometimes. 

Ideally, I want a device that hears cars and can calculate their position and speed in relation to me, in real time. Maybe it lights up green when it’s safe, but turns yellow when a car is approaching from a distance and runs through the gradients to orange and red when the car is too close and fast to stop? Maybe it uses different haptics to let me know when it’s safe, when it’s risky, and when it’s dangerous? Maybe it integrates with Google maps to model cars in real time? All of the above? Something else? If it uses haptics, maybe it’s part of a high visibility vest that vibrates or pulses or thumps? I am just brainstorming and have no idea what’s even viable, but it could be an interesting project for you.

I'm a lifelong, binaural user of hearing aids. I'm curious to know more.",2025-07-07 07:04:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ltnk9w/quick_question_for_the_deafhardofhearing/
1lsy6bk,hardofhearing,Advocating for communicating with others,"So, I’ve seen lots of “rules” for people with normal hearing to use when communicating with HoH. 

I’ve attached an example. 

I live in a “normal” world. I am the rare person that needs others to follow those tips for effective communication. 

However, I’ve been told it’s my responsibility to make sure the communication goes well. 

It’s occurred to me that what I need is to learn to ADVOCATE for my needs in conversations. 

How would I do this? All my life I’ve been taught to depend on people to use the rules in conversations, but there’s it’s just unacceptable to expect people “well you should know these rules and use them.”

I do try to remind people that I don’t hear well even with my hearing aids on. I’m now telling people I’m partially deaf. I was born with a moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears. 

If it seems like someone is talking to me, I tend to say,
— please face me
— let me move so i can see you better in the light / or turn on the light if it’s dark 

These approaches seem to be submissive(?), or something. 

The hardest tip I haven’t been able to explain is the need to get my attention first. Something people with normal hearing don’t need to do?

Like call my name, flick the lights on/off, text me, use the walker-talkie feature on the Apple Watch…

It’s frustrating that I HAVE to be constantly alert for any potential conversations. 

I have more issues with conversations but I’d like some feedback on how to better advocate for the RULES or TIPS that will best help me within conversations. 

I feel like a broken record telling people to uncover their faces so I can read their lips. Plus, I feel like I’m unimportant when I can’t be involved in conversations where the conditions are not ideal.

I actually disagree with the first ""if they misheard you"" suggestion. If I ask someone to repeat themselves I want them to repeat it exactly the same way at least once, to give me a chance to catch the words. Rephrasing things is annoying because they don't just change the words, they start to explain things like I didn't understand the *meaning* of what they said instead of not being able to hear what words they're using.

""Would you like me to leave room in the cup?""

""I'm sorry, could you say that again?""

""Oh...(spends five seconds deciding how to explain)...Leaving room in the cup means I don't fill it all the way so you have the option of putting in cream and sugar.""

I just answer the question at that point, but I *know* what 'leave room in the cup' means, I just couldn't tell that's what you said, *and* I had to try to decipher a whole new sentence. It's a waste of time and brainpower. God help us if I can't hear the explanation either, we could be here all day lol.

Edit: Hit send too early. My wife is one person who does the explanation thing and it drives me nuts. I've started saying ""please repeat the exact words you just said"" to remind her. It sounds kind of robotic but people don't get what I mean if I'm not blunt about it.

I sat my family down and basically ran though my needs with them, like how loudly I need them to speak, that I need them to face me and not be too far away, that it's better for me if they repeat the same words even if it feels weird, and to not say ""never mind"" because that's actively excluding me.   
  
For strangers, I usually will just say ""I'm hard of hearing, could you please speak up?"" or ""I'm hard of hearing, I need to you to be kind of loud"" if it's going to be a longer conversation, like at a medical appointment. You could say something similar, but with your top need or needs. Then if needed, I'll add things like ""I need you to face me"" or whatever's necessary.",2025-07-06 10:36:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lsy6bk/advocating_for_communicating_with_others/

1ls5xb9,hardofhearing,I love being HOH but it’s so hard.,"I’ve been HOH all my life. But I’ve always been in a hearing world. My mom just ignored it but I think it’s because she never really understood. Still doesn’t. I’m 31 now and I just got her to accept cc like a year ago. I mainly read lips but I’m trying to learn SEE or ASL. I thought SEE would be best for my family but no one is interested in learning for me. I have hearing aids so that should be enough. I have to constantly fit into their world instead of them trying to understand mine. Sometimes I think it’s pointless to do all this learning because I’m only one who “knows”. I have no one to practice / sign with. There is an elderly old lady in my extremely small town who is deaf and I love running into her. We sign to each other and I felt so happy and proud in a way I’ve never felt before or can even describe. Maybe it’s because it was the first time I felt valid. Is it like this for most of us? I just feel like I don’t fit in anywhere really.

Does your city have a Deaf community? Sounds like you might find peers who understand you and appreciate your experiences there. They can help you learn to sign, too.

As for your family, can you do more to advocate for yourself without escalating tension? They really don’t understand your experience but maybe there are steps you can take to help them meet your needs. For example, I had a scary stern boss who didn’t understand how little I could hear in some situations. He interpreted assertiveness as questioning his authority but I found other ways. I would say, “I didn’t catch all of what you said because there’s so much noise in here but I think you said [repeat back what I honestly heard]. Is that correct?” I was very matter of fact. When he caught on that I was honestly trying to hear him and struggling, he would call me into a quiet spot or turn off his radio or so on, then speak in a stage voice when he needed to tell me something. Excellent! He wasn’t a bad guy. Rather, we just needed to learn to meet each other’s needs. Do you think something like that would work for you?

You should look into Cued Speech.  It's easy to learn and since it uses your native language you don't have to learn a new language to communicate.

Same boat but I would never say I love being HOH. I am working now to form connections in the Deaf world and learning ASL. I just can't seem to function socially in the hearing world and that's never going to get better. However, I can eventually learn to socialize in the Deaf way because it just depends on my willpower. I can't will my ears to work.

Omg same here! I have always had hearing aids for my moderate bilateral hearing loss but my mom thinks the hearing aids cure my hearing loss and I don’t need sign even though that would be so helpful. I also don’t have anyone to practice with :(

This is my EXACT experience also! I still don’t sign, but plan to learn with a friend who took classes and is willing to teach me. I have two other siblings (there’s a total of 5 of us), that are also HoH. They do not have a desire to learn ASL, but basic signs would be helpful for them. Maybe I can get them to learn with me. Keep signing with the elder lady you run into in the small town. Maybe you two can become friends and meet up occasionally. 😍

That's one of the things I've had to learn to accept. Nobody has been willing to learn sign language to communicate with me.

Theres an American Sign Language discord with amazing people from the Deaf community who almost always are willing to join and chat. There are beginner chats and advanced chats. I'm not sure about them signing SEE, but they always answer questions and are willing to help. 
Everyones pretty chatty in there too, so you're bound to make some friends too!. Plenty of HOH'ing people as well. Best of luck, I know how hard it is to get people to understand.

I’m a 33 year old female, who’s parent ignored hers too- didn’t even tell me, I’m also learning asl and am hard of hearing! Would love to chat sometime! Maybe we can practice off of one ankthern",2025-07-05 09:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ls5xb9/i_love_being_hoh_but_its_so_hard/
1lrmg2i,hardofhearing,Caption delay,"Why are captions delayed? I find it difficult sometimes when I lip read and miss something, then have to wait to read what it was. It’s not like someone is transcribing anymore and I seriously doubt anyone is reading them given how often they just miss. I believe the delay was intended for live shows and honestly, I don’t see the need anymore because they just ### anything offensive…

[댓글]
Unless it's transcribed beforehand, it needs to be processed. Like, it's transmitted through the internet to hit computer servers where an algorithm calculates the word that sound is most likely to be. Then it comes back to the TV where individual TV settings are applied. Or it's processed by the TV itself which is far from a supercomputer. All of this happens super fast but it adds up. Honestly the fact that we can get generated captioning as fast as we do is incredible. Words need to be complete to caption and phrases might change which word it is most likely to be.

VLC can control the caption offset.

It’s so frustrating when captions on recorded stuff are wrong or out of sync. I’ve heard that, for streaming video, it can be an internet connection issue, which I guess makes sense. I live in a rural area and our internet isn’t always fabulous. 

The technology has progressed a lot, but it’s just not there for super accurate live captioning.

If audio had these issues, there'd be an uproar. Notice how difficult it is to watch reels &amp; other short videos with captions that are endlessly covered by advertising.

If you're live captioning with a tool like zipcaptions.app or Web Captioner then they're pretty instantaneous. The majority of captions on streaming platforms are terrible however!

There really is no excuse for poor speed on AI captions. They're just not using sophisticated enough technology. If you compare to the speed of https://xrai.glass app you'll see what's possible!",2025-07-04 16:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lrmg2i/caption_delay/

1lr128w,hardofhearing,Tips on tympanoplasty,"Two days ago I went under surgery for a tympanoplasty and it was successful but I have a few questions regarding the healing stage. My first question is how much bleeding is too much bleeding? I bled a lot through my bandages in the ear cup they gave me and changed the padding yesterday and the bleeding has been way less but today I noticed there is dried up blood that is blocking the opening to my ear canal in a way? I’ve been applying my ear drops as said but I don’t know if that dried blood blocking my ear canal is normal. Also I’ve noticed today too my face on the side where my ear surgery took place is swollen and wanted to know if that’s normal too? So over all I’m asking if the swollen face is normal after the surgery and how long will it take to go away, and my second question is the dried blood blocking my ear canal normal and will go away w the prescribed ear drops or id I need to go to my ear doctor and get it checked out? Please let me know guys 🙏🙏🙏

[댓글]
Everything you described is normal. The ""blood"" in the ear canal is actually packing. It is red and placed through the entire ear canal and behind the eardrum. Plus, some liquid oozing out of your ear for a week or so is totally normal as well. During the healing phase just focus on staying relaxed and not overthinking outcomes or going on internet deep dives. I was convinced mine failed then at 7.5 weeks, it turned out my hearing had improved to normal levels.

I think that's packing, blocking your ear canal. This will be removed by your doctor after a week or two. Also, after the operation, it's normal that there's fluid coming out of your ear. In my case, I know the fluid was not blood.. It's more of a medicine included with the packing.",2025-07-03 21:13:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lr128w/tips_on_tympanoplasty/

1lpnrvn,hardofhearing,Pins,"Does anyone here know do any business creators that sell pins that let people at work or school know that I am hard of hearing and wear hearing aids? That way they know to speak up and look directly at me. 

[댓글]
Not an answer to your question so sorry I am off a bit of a tangent here. I wonder if people seeing the pins actually know what strategies help the HoH? In my experience, people may speak up or may exaggerate articulation - which is unhelpful. Rarely do people automatically think,  I need to face the person.

I’ve found a few pins and stickers on Etsy that have been great

People never really look at pins. I've worn a bunch of them and people fully just never see them somehow. 

I ended up deciding for most things to go full-on-mode which meant complete voice off, typing only. 

It is extremely difficult for people to change their voice level as they've been speaking for a long time, and the only people I've seen have success with it are people I've been around for 4+ hours a day every day. It's also more difficult for women to do it bc I guess they're societally taught to not be loud. 

So I acknowledge that and instead of having to tell them to speak up every two seconds, I just don't give them the opportunity to have to.

One of friends has a button press. I just commissioned a few buttons from him. I opted for very basic. One just says “deaf” and the other has the deaf ear symbol. I don’t normally wear them. Usually just conventions and airports, I know I’m relatively safe and some people need to know that my hearing aids can’t help too much.

Check out Etsy, they will make whatever you need.",2025-07-02 05:28:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lpnrvn/pins/
1lpciba,hardofhearing,Waterproof Swim Caps or Alternatives,"Hi, new to this subreddit. 
I have a perforation in my ear drum and probably need a tympanoplasty surgery. Long overdue for an ENT appointment so set one for September. 

I already avoid getting water in my ears but was just at hot yoga recently and my sweat trickled down into my affected ear and it was painful and uncomfortable. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m missing out on a lot of water-based activities already — I can’t even do hot yoga!?

Anyways, I feel like there’s a bucket list of experiences I can’t engage in because I cannot submerge my head in water without being painful and affecting my hearing. I’ve never jumped off a rope swing into a lake, gone kayaking, tried surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, etc etc. I feel like I’m missing out on a lot of special, exhilarating thrills that I’ve always wanted to try.

I used to have custom molded earplugs and would cut a swim cap at the top to pull it over my ears when I took swimming lessons as a kid. Does anyone have a solution like this to keep your ears absolutely waterproof? I’m worried that a swim cap would not hold up in some of these high-impact scenarios. Open to hearing all ideas! 
Thanks :) 

[댓글]
They make earplugs for swimmers. A swim cap to keep them in place should help. Custom mold earplugs are a bit expensive. 

The sad part is waiting three months for a specialist appointment.

You could try an Ear Band-it.   It’s not 100% if you are going underwater a lot, but using this with custom plugs under has been very helpful for my child.   She has had 2 tympanoplasties and 2 myringoplasties. 

[ear band-it](https://a.co/d/8zLsE9m)

Any audiologist should be able to make a mold for you. It’s a silicone ear plug custom made to fit your ear as perfectly as is possible. After that, you’ll have to experiment with how far underwater you’re comfortable going.

Okay, ik this is a two day old post but I have some personal experience with this too. I have permanent holes in my ears and I can’t get any water in my ears especially when taking a shower. I have gone to an adult audiologist and got custom swim plugs that I use all the time when I out grew the ones I got when I was child. Now if I forget to bring my swim plugs and I need something to cover my ears in the short term until I can get them I have used [Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone Earplugs](https://www.amazon.com/Macks-Pillow-Soft-Silicone-Earplugs/dp/B07G1MWHNR). They help make sure I don’t get water in my ears when I need a shower.

1lp0mbd,hardofhearing,How do you cope with intentional mean comments about your hearing ?,"Hello everyone ! 

As a context : I have a mild to moderate hearing loss on my right ear and have been wearing a hearing aid on it for 10 months. For my two ears, I have chronicle otitis so I tend to have blocked ears and I have to unclog them to hear better. In general my hearing aid helps me understand men in noisy environments (bar, restaurants), their voice appears clearer. I realised I needed them last year because I felt like I needed to strain to hear even though it’s a light loss. 

I am also a musician, I decided to retake classes in my local conservatory and go to an orchestra the same time I got my hearing aid because I felt like I needed to prove myself I was unstoppable lol 

Anyway I have long hair so most of the time people don’t notice my HA (some do but don’t say anything, I notice because they stare at me ear haha) but I would mention them if they speak too softly so they don’t complain if I make repeat them, or sometimes because I took a call and they realised I took it with my HA. 

I was at a bar to celebrate my resignation, and a guy was touching my instrument, asking about my experience and level. And a girl asked me in a very amused voice : « But aren’t you deaf ?? Oh so when you don’t understand what we say it’s not because you’re autistic it’s because you’re deaf hahaha » And I was so shocked that I nervously laughed. I found it so humiliating that when someone acknowledged my skills she would talk down to me about my loss (and the fact that I might be neurodivergent) 

The thing is that in other contexts I’m used to give very spicy answers/punchlines that make people shout their mouth, but I don’t know how to navigate with this new aspect of my life ? What do you do ?

Some people use what they consider humor to fill awkward gaps in conversation. And some others seem to think that being 'outspoken' is somehow their right. 
Awkward humor I can deflect and or hop on that bandwagon most days.

It's the ones who somehow think that having no filter makes them allowed to say whatever they want that make me grind my teeth. ""But aren't you deaf?"" 

No dear, I'm not deaf, I'm hard of hearing. Are you gonna comment about the stairs being more difficult for me because I'm 20 pounds overweight? Am I illiterate because I wear glasses? Should I be locked up in a mental institution because I'm bipolar?

Or just smile and let it slide... because by the time I get to the end of my challenge questions, I'd be purple faced and probably asked to leave wherever we are.

Ugh that’s so mean and messed up! Yeah I had to quit a job I was at bc the manager was mean and kept saying I was lying about my hearing loss and that he has worse hearing loss than me and that I can’t use it as an excuse either and so on…

I always ask them why they feel the need to be that rude to a disabled person and why they thought that was an okay thing.

Stare at them and point blank ask them to elaborate further.  Usually people will back down. If they don’t, get away from them.

I lean into self deprecating humor. ""Yeah"" and shrug. Or, ""Why not both?""


To be honest, if someone said a comment like the one about ASD I'd assume they were socially awkward or they were caught so off-guard that their brain short circuited. A lot of the responses I get are out of surprised (usually unwarranted) guilt.

Wow. That’s so out of line. Wish I had a great come back for you. If, you don’t mind me asking, do you live anywhere near Baltimore?

Most people don't intend to be mean they just don't think before they speak. Its not malicious but can be rude. I just say yea I am HOH and in my case I'm not autistic. There is no shame in either of those things they just are. That you are a musician and HOH is an achievement and nothing someone says can change that. Responding to someone like that in a kind and patient manner speaks to your character.

I have been HOH since I was a small child and have profound high frequency loss in both ears. My whole life I have been ""Huh?"" -ing the crap out of people. I can't understand lyrics much of the time.  I think when you just accept it, when people make comments you can shrug them off or laugh them off.

1ln6k4b,hardofhearing,Hearing all the things,"I got my hearing aids and it’s wild. I didn’t realize I haven’t heard a bird in a really long time. I took a step out of the clinic and all the sudden I heard so many birds. 
Also I don’t have to stare people down when they talk! I can understand without making eye contact. Even my husband was like “woah I haven’t had to repeat myself once” I’m less exhausted already from not spending time filling in gaps of what I think people say. I haven’t had to ask anyone to repeat themselves which saves so much time. I went in a crowded space with a friend and I could actually understand what was happening. 
Music also hits different. There’s a sound in one of the songs I like I didn’t even know was there. Made the song sound even cooler. 
The only down side is taking off my hearing aids lol idk why but it gives me a weird sadness.

This is wonderful!  I am happy for you!  I find my hearing devices to be exhausting to wear though.  So much hearing all the time!  I like them and appreciate them but love taking them off and falling into the calm embrace of silence.  

Enjoy!

What brand of hearing aids do you have that make music sound good? My audiologist told me, “With all the amazing technology that modern hearing aids have, they cannot make music sound good. That’s a problem that hasn’t been solved yet.” Was he wrong?

How many times have people asked you to speak up? Thats my issue after getting them adjusted.

That's great! What kind did you get?

I remember when I first got my hearing aids and birds were the first things I could hear! The same thing, I didn’t realize that I hadn’t heard them in such a long time. I hate them at thrift stores though because I also forgot sliding clothes makes a noise lol I’m so happy for you!! I LOVE that you enjoy keeping yours on because most I know, myself included, love taking them off.

1lmty5l,hardofhearing,Advice for transcription app in the making,"**TL;DR:**  
I built a simple web transcription app for my dad, who’s deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other. Existing apps either don't work well in Spanish or require high-end phones. This tool uses newer speech-to-text tech and works in a browser on any device. It’s been helpful for him in 1:1 conversations and even live-translating English TV. I’m looking for a few early users (especially Spanish speakers) to try it out and share feedback.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on something I hope might help others here. My dad is deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other, and even with hearing aids, he still struggles with comprehension.

As a supplement to his hearing aid, we've tried a bunch of transcription applications—[Ava](https://ava.me/), [Otter.ai](http://otter.ai/), [Google Live Transcribe](https://www.android.com/accessibility/live-transcribe/), and others. While they’re decent in English, my dad's primary language is Spanish. I noticed the Spanish transcription quality just wasn’t where it should be for any of these applications, making them fairly ineffective for us.

What I realized is that many of these tools likely aren’t using the latest, state-of-the-art speech-to-text models. On top of that, some of the most accurate transcription apps, like Google’s Recorder, are only available on the latest phones that support on-device models. I wanted to create something that could work across all devices, not just high-end ones. So I built a simple web app that *does* use newer technology, just to see if it could make a meaningful difference.

It’s not fancy, but so far it’s performed better than alternatives and has been helpful for my dad in quieter, 1:1 settings, as a backup when he’s not wearing his hearing aids, at doctor appointments (nothing is recorded/saved so should be if patients ask to use it during visits), or to even live translate from the english tv shows with no Spanish captions since his chrome automatically translates English to Spanish on web pages.

I’m sharing it in case it might be useful to others too. My goal is just to offer another tool to help those with hearing issues.

I’m hoping to find a few early users who’d be open to trying it out and giving occasional feedback. If there’s good validation, the next step would be to turn this into a full mobile app with more features tailored to what people actually need.

Tips:  
\- It works best on mobile since it's able to use your mobile device's microphone.  
\- You can install it as a PWA on [ios](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation#ios_and_ipados_installation) and [android](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation#android_installation) for a slightly better user experience, if at some point it doesnt seem to load, just delete it and try installing it again.

Thanks so much for reading, and looking forward to the feedback, interesting use cases, and any pain points with using this app and transcription apps in general!

Data integrity and security is a problem, both with the big companies and someone independent. It’s difficult for a user to know and trust what happens to the captured sound.

The feature I’m mostly lacking in the existing apps, is the ability to adjust text size. I want the phone to be placed well to capture the speakers, and that means the text needs to be bigger so I can see it properly. Most HoH are older and shouldn’t need to. Ring their reading glasses to use the captioning.

1llwv3g,hardofhearing,Career for hoh that isn’t so frustrating,"I understand that a person who is hard of hearing can pretty much do anything… but, for me, I’m finding I’m zonked every day due to how much bandwidth it takes to get through a work day. In my case I think there is also some anxiety and auditory processing as well as insomnia = bad combination. 

I’m in my 40s but considering IT or something that is more cerebral or at a computer. I have thought about the trades but I’m too old. And something like carpentry, for example, would be really loud. I personally have found blue collar types to be less disability friendly, generally speaking. 

Anyway, I would probably be in sales if not for my hearing loss but I’m sincerely concerned about, say, giving a presentation and then not being able to do a q and a bc of the poor acoustics. In my current job it’s like people are speaking another language sometimes if they’re using speakerphone or have an accent, etc. 

Thanks for any help on this!

I’m hard of hearing, nothing better than analyst or any desk job that hearing isn’t required most of the time. Can’t recommend phones or call centers because they’d just destroy any hearing you have left with amplifiers.

I work in tech, my job is mostly remote. All the video conference call apps have captions. I have a reasonable accommodation to also have a transcription app, because the dedicated apps work better.

For in person meetings I either use the transcription app or I log in to Zoom and use the captions there. For most normal sized meetings the mic on my laptop is sufficient. For big events my company provides a mic for the speaker. 

Besides meetings, all our communication happens on Slack.

What do you currently do? 

I'm in the architecture field, a surprising amount of being able to hear is required, quite frustrating. But you may want to look at the type of employer rather than field. Depending on where you live. Large companies are more likely to accommodate without a kerfuffle, same with government. There are work around solutions for most stuff, the biggest thing is the stigma and people's attitudes.

I do accounting for a bank.  There's some phone time involved but Microsoft Teams has decent subtitles.

I found a phone, I’m about to apply for some admin jobs that have subtitles on a screen! Maybe helpful?

I'm 25 years old and I also have profound high frequency hearing loss, I work from home in IT and use the auto captions feature in Microsoft teams, there is also another caption tool integrated in windows, and that's how I get through the day, If I don't use it I don't understand what people are saying at all, I just hear mumbling

IT would be great. There are lots of work from home jobs in that field and other fields as well. In the past I did data entry and writing from home. Currently I'm a door dasher and it's not too bad, since conversations are minimal, and most of my time is spent driving.",2025-06-27 15:31:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1llwv3g/career_for_hoh_that_isnt_so_frustrating/
1lljo9e,hardofhearing,Isolation and hearing loss and loneliness,"I’m 30 years old. Doing my CA final now.
Single. Isolated. Still trying.

I’ve had mild to moderate hearing loss for a while now — not enough to be called deaf, but enough to miss conversations, group talks, casual jokes, and invitations. So I stopped showing up. I slowly disappeared from people’s lives.
And now, no one really calls me unless it’s work or a delivery guy.

After 12th, I couldn’t afford to study full-time. My father went bankrupt, and I had to start working immediately, pay family debts, and support my home. I somehow studied graduation alongside work, paid the bills, stayed in Bangalore, and just kept surviving.

In 2020 during COVID, I brought my family from our village to Bangalore — they couldn’t stay there anymore. I took care of everything with the money I earned from teaching.

I started CA in 2013, but due to life and responsibilities, I had to pause.
Only after we sold our land and cleared family debts could I fully restart again. I cleared CA Inter without coaching (because I couldn’t afford it) and now I’m in CA Final. My articleship runs till Sept 2026 and I’ll write my final exams in May 2027.

From 2013 to 2025 — it’s been just non-stop struggle.
No social life. No college memories. No weddings, parties, or birthdays.
I’ve lost touch with everyone from school and college.
I didn’t have the bandwidth for friendships — I was always in survival mode.

Now I’m 30, single, and sometimes I feel like I do want a companion, but I’m scared.
Scared I’ll make a decision out of desperation for connection, and regret it later.
And honestly… I don’t even know where I’d meet someone at this point.

Still, something inside me refuses to quit.
Yes, I’m tired. Yes, I’m insecure about how I look, about my hearing, about my age and situation. But I’m also still showing up. I’m working on my health. I’ve started again from scratch. I want to build a life that’s worth living — even if it’s alone.

Some days I think I’ve made peace with loneliness.
Other days I see groups laughing together, and it hits — that I’m missing something deeply human.

I don’t know. I just wanted to write this out.
Is there anyone else out there who feels like life may be a mess, but still holds on to some quiet belief in the future?

Still trying. Still hoping.

Hi, I totally feel and understand what you are saying. You are not alone.

I’m 34. Profound hearing loss, hearing aids. 

Before COVID I had a quite active social life, at the expense of a very stressful routine. But one way or the other, sometimes missing parts of conversations, sometimes lost, but the final balance of showing up was positive. Sometimes I had to make huge efforts.

COVID came in, isolation for years, and I still couldn’t get my social life back. I got used to the comfort of being alone.

But I’m aware this is really bad for health in general. Socialization is a human need. Like sleeping or eating. Not just “deeply human” as you mentioned, is a basic need. 

So I suggest:

- Find yourself the best treatment (aids) and slowly start showing up. You will also learn workarounds to deal with the situations, as lip reading
- Choose events you can better control (parks instead of restaurants)
- If that does not work (or simultaneously), find people in the same situation and connect with them. Through a local association for example, you are not alone
- I’m also learning that I have to accept better my problem and lose the shame. Change the mindset from being a limitation to be “a different way of experiencing the world”
- Find a professional who supports you through the process 

You are in this world, life the life you have right to. Surround yourself by people that understand and are compassionate with your problem. 

We have our own humanity and a lot to give to society.

Best of luck and a lot of strenght. You can make it! Release the best version of yourself!

Do you have hearing aids? They've helped me. But yes I get you. I've been isolating for the past few years because of HoH and other reasons

""Still trying. Still hoping."" 

Best summary ever. You're doing magical things with your life and don't forget that. 

Feel free to DM me if you need a social output, I promise I'm a good listener and a smart ass. :P",2025-06-27 03:21:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lljo9e/isolation_and_hearing_loss_and_loneliness/

BEFORE I BEGIN, I KNOW EVERY PERSON AND THEIR EXPERIENCE SIS DIFFERENT, SO I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE MY CHARACTER SOUND LIKE SHE'S EVERY PERSON OR VICE VERSA. I'M TRYING TO BE REALISTIC. IF POSSIBLE, I'D LIKE SOME WRITERS' OPINIONS ON THIS TOO, THANK YOU.

FOR CONTEXT, SHE HAS HIGH-FREQUENCY SNHL-(SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS), (POSSIBLY) INHERITED FROM HER BIOLOGICAL DAD, (SHE AND HIM BOTH HAVE A SLIGHT SOUTHERN DRAWL), AND SHE'S IS MODERATE IN ONE EAR AND HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN A PROFOUND DIAGNOSIS IN THE OTHER EAR (WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY SEVERE). SHE CHOOSES TO SPEAK AND CAN DO SO QUITE WELL (I HOPE THIS ALL MAKES SENSE), BUT SHE ONLY USES ASL/OTHER MEANS TO COMMUNICATE IF HER HEARING AIDS AREN'T WORKING/ARE OUT. (SHOULD I CHANGE IT TO BE MORE FREQUENT, GIVEN MY QUESTIONS?)

QUESTION 1: GIVEN THIS INFO, HOW OFTEN WILL SHE ASK SOMEBODY TO REPEAT THEMSELVES (I KNOW INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND NOISE, ALONG WITH HOW GOOD ONE'S HEARING AIDS ARE, PLAYS A ROLE), I'M SCARED I'M UNDERDOING IT IN MY BOOK AS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN A WHOLE LOT YET. SO DOES IT NEED TO HAPPEN MORE OFTEN? OR AM I OVERTHINKING IN TERMS OF THINKING I HAVE TO CLARIFY SHE HAS ASKED SOMEBODY TO REPEAT THEMSELVES ALOT?

QUESTION 2: IF I HAVE HER MISPRONOUNCE CERTAIN WORDS, WOULD THAT MAKE SENSE? (I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES UNDERSTANDING CONSONANTS TOO) ESPECIALLY GIVEN HER NEWLY PROFOUND EARS? OR DARE I SAY, WOULD IT BE RUDE IF I EVEN CALLED IT, OR HAD SOMEONE ELSE STATE THAT SHE HAS A BIT OF A ""DEAF ACCENT"" TOO?

AND IF SHE DOES MISSPRONOUNCE CERTAIN THINGS, SHOULD I WRITE THEM OUT PHONICALLY, OR WRITE THEM MISPRONOUNCED WITH ANOTHER CHARACTER SAYING THE RIGHT WORD, OR EVEN IF I USE () WITH THE RIGHT SPELLING IN BETWEEN? OR SHOULD I DO A COMBO OF THOSE? LIKE AN EXAMPLE: ""I HATE SIMP!"" (SHRIMP) (OR SHOULD SHE SAY ""RIMP""/""IMP"" SINCE THE AFOREMENTIONED CONSONANT THING)?

OR AGAIN, SHOULD SHE NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES AT ALL? ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S BEEN SPEAKING NORMALLY OTHERWISE AND MAYBE EVEN HAD SPEECH THERAPY WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER?

AGAIN I DON'T MEAN FOR THIS OR ANY OF MY QUESTIONS TO SOUND RUDE OR ANYTHING BUT...BUT...SHOULD I MAYBE SAY INSTEAD OF HER OTHER EAR BEING MODERATE OR SEVER, SHOULD I SWITCH IT TO MILD TO FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM, ""LESSEN"" THINGS...AGAIN I HOPE THAT DON'T COME OFF AS RUDE/DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST ANYONE.

SORRY IF THIS IS CONFUSING I HAVE ISSUES EPLXIANING/ASKIGN THINGS SOMETIMES...I HOPE NONE OF THESE COMES OFF AS RUDE...I DON'T WANNA MISINTERPRET HER OR THE DEAF CULTURE. YET IDK ANYONE WHO'S DEAF/HOH WHO CAN HELP ME, PLUS...I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXTRA MONEY FOR A DEAF/HARD OF HEARING TORITIQUE MY WRITING OR ATM ALL...AND IDK IF IT'S EVEN THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THAT NAYWAYS.

YOUR POST WAS DELETES IN R/DEAF BY THE AUTOMOD FOR RESEARCH. I SUGGEST LOOKING AT THEIR FAQ. THEY HAVE SOME NOTES ABOUT WRITING DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHARACTERS.

I'm not part of the deaf community, but if I were you I'd avoid trying to write anyone's accent. You're likely to come across negatively. Think, for example, of old novels by white authors that would have their black characters ""speak"" in horribly stereotyped language.

Tread carefully, and I apologize if I've misunderstood your post. It was hard for me to read.

Pretty sure she wouldn’t.

Here and now, I am considered deaf , but growing up I was hard of hearing.  So, I don’t have a deaf accent, but I most certainly mispronounced words (still do).  I pronounced words the way I heard words pronounced.  I was hard of hearing, so I heard words pronounced “wrong”.  

As a child, people always tried to correct the way I spoke.  Of course, I didn’t  understand that I was saying the words incorrectly.  All I heard was people saying what I was saying.  I heard no difference, and it was extremely frustrating.  

I still pronounce words incorrectly.  It is what it is.

I don’t think having the character mispronounce words strengthens your writing much or the character in any way. Sure, there may be hoh folks who mispronounce words but I’m hoh and have no accent and do not mispronounce words any more than the next person as far as I know. I mean, my partner laughs at the way I pronounce Warren, for example, so I guess there are the occasional words. But unless it’s something like that to where it’s idiosyncratic I think it’ll just make your writing seem hack.

I was surprised to see a massive dip in my right ear at 3000 and 4000Hz when I did a test a bit ago. That first test was 25db at 3000Hz and 30db at 4000Hz, I got this one to confirm the dip and scored even worse. I dont notice anything different with my hearing or how my ears feel. I have not taken a blow to the head, had a concussion, been around gunshots or been exposed to hearing loss inducing noise levels. My audiologist was just as befounded. I have an appointment coming up with my family doctor and will most likely see an audiologist.

The dip is frequently referred to as a notch, and is common if you have noise exposure hearing loss, from what I understand! Were you around any extreme noise or worksites?

See an ENT*

Are you by any chance noticing fullness, or leaking a clear fluid from your ear at any time?

No idea I’m not a specialist.


you need an ent.

I also found out that my QuickSIN results were Binaural: SNR-50 = 13.5 dB, Moderate Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) loss indicating significant difficulty with speech understanding in the presence of background noise. I wasn’t told at all, which is also weird because I asked about issues with background noise and all that happened was her giving me a sheet on how to tell people to repeat themselves and lower/pause the tv. Which didn’t really help since I can’t pause people in public. 
I finally got a second opinion because it felt like my concerns and questions weren’t being answered. My results from both tests were compared and confirmed to be accurate. After explaining my results in more depth, the first thing the new audiologist said to me was that I would benefit from hearing aids. Which I told my audiologist was interesting because one of the first things the other audiologist said was that I wasn’t and since then I’ve been struggling to try to understand what’s been going on sometimes. He actually seemed more upset than me about what information I wasn’t given by the previous audiologist. He did a way better job of explaining my hearing loss and what to expect. He also pointed out that my insurance fully covers hearing aids every three years. If I don’t like them I can always return them. That there won’t be a negative and that I’m not dramatic for wanting to be able to hear in public spaces. After being medically gaslighted my whole childhood it was nice to be told that it’s ok to use something that will help. 
My question is any advice on hearing aids? What I should expect and what helped? ",2025-06-17 23:21:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1le22eb/finally_got_a_second_opinion/
1ldrqys,hardofhearing,New to hearing loss,"My husband (28) has been diagnosed with profound hearing loss. He has over 50% hearing loss in his left ear, and 30-40% in his right ear. We noticed the decrease in hearing about 3 years ago, and it has gotten worse. We saw an ent first who dismissed any sort of physical problem with the ear- no blockages, scarring or visible trauma or infection. She referred us to an audiologist. 

We had our first audiologist appointment yesterday, and they of course suggest hearing aids sooner rather than later, which we agreed to. 

We don’t have a known cause of his hearing loss at this time, and the doctor said by the initial visit there isn’t really a way to project what the future looks likes. Hopefully as they work together with follow ups and such, we can get more answers. 

The hearing aids will be in next week, and I am trying to compile a list of questions, but this is a whole new world to us. We are both generally healthy people from generally healthy families. I have no idea what to ask. 

We are a very average middle class family- we make to much for any sort of assistance- we have shit insurance- and aside from the initial shock of the cost of hearing aids we have no idea what else we need to look into or think about either now or in the future.

1ldjjql,hardofhearing,"I’m a deaf person in Korea who speaks, but I feel excluded from both the hearing and Deaf communities. Where do I belong","🇺🇸 English
[Intro] Between Two Worlds: Deaf vs. Oral
In South Korea, deaf and hard-of-hearing people are generally divided into two main categories:

• Deaf (농인): Those who use Korean Sign Language (KSL) as their primary language and share a cultural identity.

• Oral deaf (구화인): Those who use spoken language to communicate, often with the help of hearing aids or cochlear implants.

I don’t fully belong to either.
I was born with profound hearing loss—around 100 decibels. I can speak, and I’ve been trained to communicate orally. But I often struggle in daily conversations. I don’t use sign language fluently, and that makes me a stranger in the Deaf community. At the same time, hearing people often expect me to act like them—ignoring my limitations.
I live in-between, constantly explaining, constantly adapting—and constantly excluded.

[1] Privilege within the Deaf Community
Many deaf people in Korea today have received cochlear implants at a young age. They grow up speaking, go to regular schools, and later get jobs through disability quotas at large companies or public institutions.
They adapt well. That’s good for them.
But here’s the issue: many of them don’t acknowledge their privilege. They say things like:
“I worked hard, anyone can succeed.”
They see people like me—who still struggle to communicate—as just lazy or negative.
They enjoy the benefits of disability hiring, but act as if they’re fully ""normal,"" sometimes even hiding their deaf identity.
The media celebrates them as inspirational ""disability overcomers."" Meanwhile, people like me remain invisible, inconvenient, and excluded—even within the disability community.

[2] Even Deaf People Reject Me
I tried to learn Korean Sign Language and connect with the Deaf community. But when I made mistakes, I was often met with impatience or silence. Some people rolled their eyes. Others just ignored me. A few mocked me openly.
This rejection felt exactly like what I get from the hearing world—when I ask people to speak slowly or use clear lip movements, they often refuse.
Both groups seem to say the same thing:
“You’re too different. You don’t belong here.”
It’s exhausting.

[3] No Place to Breathe
I feel like I have no home.
To the hearing world, I’m too deaf.
To the Deaf world, I’m not deaf enough.
Even when I meet other deaf people, they often dismiss my concerns or say I’m overreacting.
It’s not just about communication. It’s about recognition. I want to be seen, not as broken or flawed, but as someone who lives between two worlds—and deserves dignity, too.

[4] This Isn’t a Rant. It’s a Survival Scream.
I’m not writing this to complain or attack anyone.
I just want to say:
If you are someone who lives in-between, who feels erased by both sides—you’re not alone.

🇰🇷 한국어 번역
[서문] 두 세계 사이에서: 농인 vs 구화인
한국에서 청각장애인은 보통 두 그룹으로 나뉩니다.
• 농인: 한국수어(KSL)를 주된 언어로 사용하고 문화적 정체성을 가진 사람들
• 구화인: 말과 입모양으로 의사소통하며 인공와우나 보청기에 의존하는 사람들
나는 어느 쪽에도 완전히 속하지 못합니다.
나는 약 100데시벨의 청력을 가졌고, 말을 할 수 있습니다. 말로 의사소통을 배웠지만, 일상 대화는 늘 어렵습니다. 수어는 능숙하지 못해 농인 커뮤니티에서도 이방인이 되고, 청인들은 나에게 ‘정상적인’ 대화를 기대하며 내 어려움을 무시합니다.
결국 나는 양쪽 모두에서 배제된 채, 항상 설명하고, 조율하고, 버텨야 하는 위치에 서 있습니다.

[1부] 청각장애인 사회 내부의 특권
많은 청각장애인들은 인공와우 수술을 받고 일반학교를 다녔으며, 장애인 채용 전형으로 대기업이나 공공기관에 취업합니다.
이들은 잘 적응합니다. 그것 자체는 좋은 일입니다.
하지만 문제는, 이들이 자신의 구조적 이점을 인정하지 않는다는 것입니다.
“나도 노력해서 성공했어. 누구나 할 수 있어.”
이런 말을 하며, 나처럼 의사소통에 여전히 어려움을 겪는 사람들을 게으르다고 치부합니다.
장애인 전형의 혜택은 누리면서, 자신이 청각장애인이라는 정체성은 감춥니다.
언론은 그들을 ""장애를 극복한 인물""로 추켜세웁니다. 그 사이 나는 보이지 않는 존재가 됩니다.

[2부] 농인들에게도 거부당하다
나는 수어를 배우고 농인들과 가까워지려 했습니다. 하지만 실수를 하면 짜증을 내거나 대화를 중단하는 경우가 많았습니다. 어떤 사람들은 눈을 굴리거나, 아예 나를 무시했습니다.
청인 사회에서 내가 입모양으로 말해 달라고 해도 거절당하는 경험과 똑같습니다.
양쪽 모두가 이렇게 말하는 것 같습니다.
“너는 우리와 달라. 여기 있을 자격 없어.”
그건 너무나 지치는 일입니다.

[3부] 숨 쉴 공간조차 없다
나는 갈 곳이 없습니다.
청인 세계에겐 나는 너무 ‘농’이고,
농인 세계에겐 나는 ‘농인도 아닌’ 존재입니다.
다른 청각장애인들과 이야기해도, 내 말은 “피해의식”이라며 묵살됩니다.
이건 단지 의사소통의 문제가 아닙니다.
인정받고 싶다는 기본적인 감정의 문제입니다.
나는 고장난 존재가 아니라, 두 세계 사이에서 살아가는 존재로서 존중받고 싶을 뿐입니다.

[4부] 이것은 푸념이 아니라 생존의 외침입니다
나는 누구를 탓하고자 이 글을 쓰는 게 아닙니다.
단지 말하고 싶었습니다.
만약 당신도, 나처럼 두 세계 사이에 끼어 소속되지 못하고 지워진 감정을 느낀다면…
당신은 혼자가 아닙니다.

A lot of people can relate to this - I was born with a profound progressive deafness, without access to/integration with Deaf Culture or sign language. I dont feel a part of hearing society or the Deaf world (despite huge but slow efforts in both).

Its like theres no culture or community or understanding for  people inbetween - its just seen it as Deaf or Hearing. But its a very different experience. I keep trying to learn sign, as at least its a language I can learn to meet people with. But I personally find it very hard to practice and retain it.

안녕하세요, im hearing but follow this community because my partner has hearing loss. I just wanted to say that I see you and your struggle, and I can’t imagine how frustrating and disheartening it is to be treated as you have been. I hope things get better for you and that you can find people who appreciate you and your way of doing things ❤️

I’m in the same boat as you here in America. Never accepted by the deaf community, constantly struggled to adapt and survive in the hearing.

I appreciate this post

I wish I had a great suggestion for you, sadly I don’t 😞. Is there a disability agency or non profit that might be able to help? Is therapy an option? Even social media groups?

Yep. A lot of us late-deafened or not-quite-hard-of -hearing-enough to have learned properly as a kid. 

Sometimes I want to just go voice off forever. Even though my hearing isn’t all that bad on the spectrum of deafness, it’s enough that I feel out of place in both communities. 

I always lean toward just leaning into the Deaf community and screw the haters. I can always get better at signing, but I’ll never get better at hearing.

1ld3b7j,hardofhearing,I’ve been dealing with hearing loss since I was 11. It’s gotten worse over time.,"  
I’ve been dealing with hearing loss since I was 11. It’s gotten worse over time.  
Now **I'm 32,** I can barely understand spoken words.

I’m not very social because of that. Conversations take effort, and most people don’t have the patience.  
Over the years, that isolation started affecting everything, not just my hearing, but my mind, my faith, and how I see myself.

I went through a short marriage that ended. It was painful for both sides.  
Since then, I’ve pulled back from everyone. I stay in one room, sit in one chair, work silently, and barely talk anymore.  
I get angry over small things. I feel like I’ve disappeared from life.

I’m not here for advice or attention.  
I just want to know if there’s one person who understands what it’s like to feel this way.  
To live with long-term hearing loss. To feel distant from people. To carry too much, alone.

If you’re that person, I’d be glad to talk, even a little.

[댓글]
Hi there, I understand how you feel. I understand the social withdrawal, the awkwardness and difficulties that arise. I've felt it my whole life. Some situations are really difficult; it's definitely caused me a lot of pain throughout my life. I was certainly often very angry, bitter and self-pitying when I was younger. Those feelings still arise sometimes, in difficult situations. 

I'm mostly at peace with it now. I'm severely deaf, and I love my hearing aids for making my involvement with society possible. I understand you're not looking for advice, and perhaps you've explored this avenue already. 

Sending love and support!

Have you ever used - hearing aids, cochlear implants, sign language?

I'm sorry my friend. I'm also 32 and dealing with profound loss above 3kHz. You can see my audiogram that was posted on my profile. You aren't alone.

Sorry to hear you’re struggling. I’m in a similar situation but a little older in my 40s. All I can suggest is try and focus on what you can still do and remember tomorrow is a new day.

To give you an example I used to enjoy running in clubs of people but now can’t hear what people are saying with the background noise and because I can’t see their faces. So I joined a gym and now lift weights. People don’t talk to me as 98% of people listen to music so I feel right at home.

1ld0tst,hardofhearing,A website that transcribes the first minute of those automated phone menus (IVR systems).,"Just wanted to share something that might be useful for people who struggle with phone calls to customer service.

There's a new website called [CallCutter.com](http://CallCutter.com) that **transcribes the first minute of those automated phone menus** (IVR systems). You enter a phone number and it shows you the text of what the recording says, plus a summary that highlights how to reach a human representative.

If the number isn't in the database yet, you can add it within a couple minutes.

Right now it only works with toll-free numbers, but we plan to expand to other customer service lines if enough people use it.

Granted, it doesn't completely solve the problem of companies using voice recognition instead of number prompts, but having a **written version** of what's being said can make these calls less frustrating.

The site is straightforward to use and might save some of you time and stress when dealing with customer service calls.

1lcz0bk,hardofhearing,Looking to collaborate: Short film on hearing loss,"Dear hardofhearing,

My name is Markus Simonsen, and I am applying this year to DFFB, the film school in Berlin. As part of the admissions process, I am producing a short docu-film (3 minutes).

I would like to focus on hearing loss – particularly the aspects that are often invisible to the outside world. In that regard, I wanted to ask if anyone might be interested in helping me to get in contact with people who is interested in participating, and sharing some experiences as a person living with hearing loss.

The film will not be an interview but a visual portrayal of how the world might be experienced from this perspective. It will only be shown internally to the school’s instructors and will not be made public.

I understand that this is short notice – the film must be submitted for editing by Thursday at 6 PM. I am currently in Berlin and fully flexible throughout the week.

Thank you very much in advance



Best regards,  
Markus Simonsen

[댓글]
you can absolutely identify as hard of hearing. do you have a hard time hearing due to clinical hearing loss? congrats, you, too, are hard of hearing.

You absolutely qualify as hard of hearing. Unilateral deafness is hearing loss. Just because your other ear functions well doesn’t erase the very real challenges you face with sound localization, group conversations, or hearing in noisy environments. That’s a functional impairment. Period.

People who “corrected” you are gatekeeping based on their own narrow experiences, not clinical reality. You don’t need bilateral loss or daily communication breakdowns to identify as HoH. If your hearing loss affects how you move through the world, you belong under the umbrella.

Your experience is valid. Don’t let anyone convince you otherwise.

Whatever you want. Deafness is a spectrum. You can identify as Hard of Hearing.

Hey leftie! I'm a rightie 😆 left deafness since birth and i thought everyone only have one functional ear for quite a while. Lol. Definitely a HOH. We would have to do a 360 scan whenever we hear someone calling out our name because we can't pinpoint where sounds are coming from anymore 🤣 but i struggled with severe tinnitus on my right the past 8 years (getting worse) so I'm now officially almost completely deaf. I miss the sound of rain sometimes. Definitely missed being just left-deaf. Lol

It is a genuine struggle. I lurk here because I have SSD with tinnitus in that ear. Presents itself with social, career, and even basic functional challenges.

I am SSD and classify myself as hard of hearing. It literally is hard for me to hear (in the same ways as you described)

I think the label doesn’t matter so much.  If it does ask yourself, is it hard for me to hear events of that as sometimes, so I’d say sometimes you’re hard of hearing, which is fine.  You don’t have to reach a certain standard to hang out with the Deaf community, just keep being yourself, don't pretend to be something else, which is something you’re obviously doing quite well already. 

Stick around read some posts &amp; ask the questions that come up.  I think you’ll find that none of us really know how much of this is going toapply to you, except perhaps the people that are like you, definitely one ear, and you'll certainly find them here.

It’s your identity is your choice. You can be HoH in some situations and drag in others. At my desk, I’m HoH, get my attention before taking to me. In a coffee shop or the Costco food court, I’m deaf. Please wave me down when my order is ready.

I lost hearing and am SSD too.  Do you experience tinnitus in your dead ear?

If people aren't even willing to accept that you have difficulty hearing in some situations they probably aren't going to do anything to help you in those situations either.  There are better people out there.

You can definitely qualify as hard of hearing or as partially deaf- that what my brother choose. He has one ear that is hearing (better than most people) and one ear he can’t hear out of. Directional hearing is impossible and that is something to be given breaks about for sure.

It’s a weird word play thing. 

Can a deaf person be hard of hearing? Can someone who is hard of hearing call themselves deaf? They mean very similar things just to different levels. Deaf means a person who has profound hearing loss to the extent they can hear basically  anything. Whereas someone who is hard of hearing will likely be able to hear certain things.

When I was maybe 3 year old, my parents learned that my right ear can’t hear at all. The doctor at the time think that I lost my hearing at birth.  I do own a pair of hearing aids but I’m don’t like wearing it. So I consider myself hard of hearing.

If you have a good skiing of hearing loss in one or both ears that it effects your day to day life then you are classified as HoH or Deaf

If you are wearing hearing aids and can hear very little without them then you’re hoh. 

If you’re deaf and wearing a CI then you’re not hoh.",2025-06-16 02:32:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lchqoo/im_completely_deaf_in_one_ear_do_i_class_as_hoh/

Yes, constantly. Unless you look like their grandparents, good luck getting anybody to actually acknowledge your hearing impairment. I’ve been told that I come across as very aloof. Well, no shit? I can’t understand half of the conversation and I’m too tired to pretend and try to participate. People don’t understand how much energy it takes. I burned myself out for years trying to act “normal.” I just can’t do it anymore. 

(I need up upgrade my hearing aids lol)

😭😭😭 yes.  

Even my husband and daughter do this to me.  I’m probably not as hard of hearing as some on here.  I can tell that words are being said, but I have no idea what they are if you’re not in the same room and looking at me.  I’m working on not getting angry and frustrated, but it’s hard.  

I’m pretty sure that “I’m sorry, what?” is my catch phrase.

my manager knowing the extent of my deafness, I said I’m good at lipreading and while asking me a question about it she walked ahead of me😭

Happens often to me. Add to this, when you ask them to repeat themselves, they often do one of three things:

1. Do the exact thing you just said wasn’t working for you, and you still can’t hear or understand.
2. Saying, “Never mind,” or something to that effect.
3. Walking off with a disgruntled huff.

I quietly curse them, that they may become Deafened or have a loved one experience it....They have no idea about what we have to deal with....

Yes! To no avails!

Yeah, I can be having a good conversation, asked for a repeat to confirm,  explain I'm Deaf, and the other person NEVER looks at me again !!!!!!

My response is always ""I know you're saying words, I just don't know what they are.""

This started my hearing aid journey. I worked at a place where the boss (during covid no less, so masks) had a nasty habit of not only talking quietly but turning away and issuing orders while walking away. 

I started getting in trouble for not 'completing tasks assigned' that I had no idea of. 

Despite many many times where I insisted that she had to talk to me directly, verify that I'd heard, she did not and would not. 

Out of spite, I went for a hearing test so I could staple the audiogram to her face. And ended up having brain (adjacent) surgery to repair a temporal encephalocele before I could even get to that point.

Maybe a tie clip or necklace that says: ""IF YOU CAN'T READ THIS I CAN'T HEAR YOU"".

I always let them finish talking. Then I explain to them they need to face me. 

Overexplaining actually never helped.

I find people assume that you’re just telling them to tell them and not because you expect them to do things that would make it easier to hear. I would directly tell them what makes it easier and harder for you to hear, and what you need them to do in a conversation

For me it’s whispering. Wtf are you whispering at me like it’s a damn secret you’re afraid to say out loud? I’ve told you 100x I can’t hear you whisper! Aaarghhh!!!

I have had people turn their backs to me and apologize for doing it while doing it only to continue to do it.  

I now say, “You’re not forgiven.”

They laugh or give a long explanation to why they’re doing it, but they keep doing it.

I JUST made a post about this.. its so frustrating. I just started a new job and cannot for the life of me get people to understand I cant hear when they face away from me..",2025-06-15 22:13:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lcckim/not_understanding_when_people_arent_facing_me/
1lc7seg,hardofhearing,Apps for captioning in-person conversations,"EDIT: I meant to ask about LIVE CAPTIONS, not Live Listen. 😒 🤦‍♀️ 


I have an iPhone and have tried Live Listen. Nothing comes up when I have it turned on. 

I’ve tried using Notes with the microphone on and obviously it produces a run on account of the conversation without breaking out who’s talking. 

Is there an app for the iPhone for captioning or transcribing in real time, in person conversations? 

This is particularly needed for having conversations with medical professionals and staff, coworkers and managers, and my spouse. All who say they’ve said something, but I didn’t hear. 

[댓글]
The app is only half of it. Live listen doesn’t depend on internet, so captions aren’t as good. Apps like Otter or Nagish need internet, but accuracy is better. 

The app will only caption what the microphone picks up. The iPhone mic is horrible. You’ll have much better results with a remote microphone near the speaker.

In a pinch I have opened up Zoom, started a video call, and turned on captions. Works great.

Live Listen is not for captions. That’s for hearing aids with Bluetooth. When I turn that on, I can hand my phone to someone, they talk into the phone and the audio is sent to my hearing aids via Bluetooth. 

There is Live Captions for iOS but I think it’s only on newer phones. Go to Settings &gt; Accessibility. Under Hearing, you’ll see Live Captions. It works really well in my book. 

Only issue I have with Live Captions is that it flips my hearing aids into audio mode which turns the mic down and throws me off.

Just in case you’re still looking, [Nagish](https://getapp.nagish.com/7Z9B/eojo3uc6) has a free app for phone calls AND in person conversations for either iOS or android devices

Is there a way to have just the speech captioned and nothing else? 

I do not need nor want to have audio descriptions and sound effect descriptions. I especially hate it when it says “music intensifies” or something like that. 

Can I turn that off? 

[댓글]
Personally, I love seeing the caption ""scary music"" during a movie. But I think the captions are built into program or movie and it kind of depends on the closed-caption service and what they choose to include.

Somethings have two options when I’m putting subs on, English and English for the hearing impaired/SDH. The second subtitles the noises etc as well as the speech. 

On TV channels though it’s usually just on or off as an option so it really depends on where you’re watching.

Depends on the media. Most DVDs have subtitles which should be what you have described.

Yeah just look for the option without (CC) behind a language.

Funnily enough, I've been telling people about the captioning of sound recently. I rewatched Loki, and there's a scene where some gnarly stuff is happening off camera, but the captions say nothing - if, like me, you can't hear what's happening, you just see someone's sociopathic grin get more and more intense. I was laughing at her expression while my boyfriend's face was contorted with horror.

I love those little gems, they're usually so banal and uninspired. ""Loud explosions"". Thank you closed captioning, the fireball on the tv wasn't good enough to indicate that.

You want subtitles, not closed captions. 

I prefer closed captions because I'm deaf and I can't hear the ""sounds"" like footsteps or if the music changes, or if a slam happens. Those sounds are important if you can't pick up on them at all. I hate when music plays and they just list the title of the song or ""music"" rather than the actual words.",2025-06-15 06:15:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lbtfps/closed_captions/

What do you mean by ear crackling?

Peace to you in Jesus name

Try collagen powder drinks.

It is most likely from neck or some tissue muscle problem

I have just started collagen and may go back to physio

The Ent said it can be referred from Neck

They also same the Jaw

It definately is a nerve issue

Pray :)

Maybe we can get through it together

I tried otovent recently was scary

i am still doing research, as i also have a rash type on face from the ear

SO it can seem like allergy,

But mine is clogged/blocked all day + tinnitus

Not sure if a dentist can assist are your teeth and jaw ok?

DO you know when it started did you have accident/ stressful event

I know i did

So my faith has sustained me

Im hoping collagen will help and magnesium. 

If its the Jaw there is something called RAD JAW i have some and havnt had it in a long time .

Same nasal sprays etc did not work

1l9k08d,hardofhearing,Recognizing sounds needing your attention,"Have any of you tried any AI-powered sound recognition tools, like those accessibility features on the iPhone, Android, Samsung, Amazon Echo or other brands, to help with detecting smoke alarms, broken glass, running water, etc. What did you think of it? Do you like using them regularly?

[댓글]
I just activated the hearing devices and sound alerts on my Android and am... kinda... It thinks my overnight snoring was an appliance beep. Cool enough, it records the audio of the alert, and there's me ""snccchhhh... snncccchhhh..."" Uhm, that's not an appliance, that's a guy that could stand to lose about 15 pounds.

All in all, so far, it's been uh, interesting. Clearly the reliability is in question but it's still relatively new. I'm intrigued purely out of curiosity.

On iPhone for a small period of time I used the accessibility feature that flashes a white light on your phone when you get a notification. Eventually turned it off as I felt it looked like someone taking a picture with the flash on. I’d have my phone in my hand while talking to someone and a notification flash would go off. You could see in their face they thought I’d taken a picture of them.


I couldn’t see a way to change the colour or flash pattern. I remember having a second hand android back in highschool and it came with the light feature already on. It flashed at the front of the phone and the colours were different whereas the phone I currently have flashes white at the back on the phone near the camera. 


I often miss my phone when I’m out in public or sleeping which isn’t convenient. I set my ringer to be at its loudest and hope I hear the ping. I feel like it’s a weird learning curve figuring out what I can and can’t hear due to my type of loss

Tried it.  7 out of 10?

It gave me the notification for the sounds, but I don't really need most of them.

One thing I can't here in my home is the doorbell, if I'm not near it.  The sound alerts on Android did accurately notify me of the doorbell, but it also sometimes mistook other sounds for the doorbell.

I think it could eventually be great, and right now would be quite useful for some people in some situations.  I think it's benefit differs for each user.

I’ve tried the Sound Recognition on my iPhone. For some reason, it doesn’t pick up any sounds. 🤷‍♀️",2025-06-12 11:25:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l9k08d/recognizing_sounds_needing_your_attention/

 Wondering if thats how it starts out for many ppl, also i know many will recommend me to go to a doctor but im currently unemployed (just a broke college student) and cant afford it

I was 23 years old. I was in my bedroom and my roommate came in. He asked me how the clicking in my ceiling fan wasn’t making me crazy. I didn’t hear anything. I thought he was messing with me. We called in my other roommate and he verified that there was a loud clicking sound coming from the fan. I went to an ENT doctor and audiologist after that. They told me I had a serious hearing loss.  Before that I never would have guessed.

Stop listening to your music loud and start protecting your hearing (I assume citing living is loud). 


I think Covid set it off for me. I’d always been advised by my dr that I should watch my hearing and see an audiologist. Just after Covid I found myself struggling to hear at work. Eventually made an appointment with an audiologist who determined there was hearing loss.


He said I likely had it for a long time but my brain found ways to compensate so I didn’t notice. I figure I relied on lip reading more than I ever knew and people wearing masks impacted my ability to hear.

Contact a college where they teach audiology and they may need patients to practice. 

I know with massage therapy and optometry you can get service free or very cheap but it's from students but the professors oversee them so you should be able to get some answers. 

I have 2 types of hearing loss, congenital (born with it) and acquired (I did it to myself 😆). I don't remember what made me actually go get tested but I was like 23-24 and I went to a miracle ear office where they sell hearing aids and got a free test and once I started telling my close friends literally ALL of them separately were like ""DUH! Of course you're HOH."" Literally everyone knew but me 😂 how am I supposed to know what other people can hear?

It was a bit over a year ago (at age 24). I was lying in bed on my right side, ear in the pillow. My husband yells out the cats name - evidently she had been meowing very loudly in the hall, as she tends to do at night when she gets lonely (even though our door is open, lmao). I couldn’t hear her screams at all, unless I lifted my right ear off the pillow. I later took an online hearing test which said I had problems hearing. Not believing it, I had my husband and mother take it, and they both came out normal. (And my mother had her own hearing checked recently prior by her doctor) Some time later I went to an audiologist, and was told I had 50% reverse slope hearing loss in my left ear. Right ear is normal.

My old elementary school gave us free hearing and vision tests and that’s how it was confirmed. Before that I noticed every time I said some words no one understood me (the whole time I was hearing the words wrong and saying them the way I heard them) but ig what’s sucky is that you really don’t know until you’ve been told sometimes.

I was six. My parents noticed that I turned my boombox waaaay up.

I’ve known about the tinnitus since forever. I don’t realize how much loss there was until I met my (now) wife and she noticed I wasn’t hearing everything.

I had a sinus infection and as it was resolving tinnitus started. It never stopped. Still hasn't, only gotten louder and spread to the other ear. I had gotten ""normal"" tinnitus before that popped in and then faded out but never longer than maybe a couple minutes tops. Went to the audiologist/ENT combo and they found the cookie bite hearing loss. It's funny because on the paperwork you can see where he had circles eustacian tube dysfunction and then crossed it off as he realized it was more serious. 

Previously I had seen people's faces move while talking to ne in the printmaking studio and not heard anything, like at all. It was unsettling but it was not every time. So I sort of wrote it off as being a sensory issue since I also have those and there was a fan in that room to keep fumes from building up.

I left manhattan on a long get away weekend with my now husband then boyfriend to his family’s country house 20 years ago.  I remember I stepped into the quiet house and said to him” what the heck is that noise?” He was like,  “ what noise?”  It was my tinnitus ringing off the hook..",2025-06-12 01:34:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l9a4yt/how_and_when_did_you_guys_know_there_was/

is there a Vocational Rehabilitation in your area you can reach out to? they may be able to help you with finding/applying for accessible jobs or the assistive technology needed for work

I have the same issue. No phones or extremely loud environments. Prefer office. It's been tough for me too. Over 40+ applications for anything to pay bills. I'm there with ya.

I work for a very large, public company you may have heard of. When I filled out the online application, there was a section asking about specific disabilities and impairments and I ruminated over what to put here. In the end, I went with full disclosure and I did enter that I am extremely hard of hearing. I’m glad I did because this company has been wonderful in their accommodations. I’ve seen them also have smooth processes for people who needed special keyboards and chairs, despite the added cost and of course have been great with any ADA related requests that I’ve known about. This company is frequently included in the “best companies to work for” list that comes out every year and I am not surprised, they seem serious about employee welfare. I just wanted to let you know these places do exist and not to lose hope.

Are you in the US? I use Bluetooth hearing aids and live captioning for work. If you are in the US you have ADA protections and vocational rehab as resources. Vocational rehab in my state provides hearing aid, free college tuition, and assistance in identifying workplace accommodations.

My work has an app that will feed calls to my office to my phone, which in turn, directly feeds into my hearing aids and I can use the phone just fine with that capability. I don’t know your level of loss but maybe something like that could help? 

You could also look up the Job Accommodation Network and see different ideas for access to a phone with a hearing impairment.

Your mileage may vary depending on your level of loss and your communication preferences, but would any of the captioned phone systems or VRS work for you? 

I use a combination of over ear headset that plays well with my CI and captioning for calls, and quite a bit of my day is dedicated to calls. It works well enough to get the job done, for me anyway.

Can't understand scanner or radio traffic worth a damn and that's not been helpful.

Super, super proud of you. And after all that hemming and hawing about hearing aids you did... :P

Your ear holes will get sore and that's ok too. Take them out for a bit, don't over tax your mind and your ears.

1l7odc3,hardofhearing,Closed Captions on DVDs,"Note - I posted similar content on r/deaf before I learned of this sub reddit. 

According to my research and interpretation, the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires all public facing video content to be accessible to everyone. Meanwhile the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) bridges the gap between old and new media. 

Which introduces my dilemma. 

Why are DVDs excluded from these two laws thereby renting, buying, or borrowing from the library?And why no organization or the government is doing anything about it?

I get it. It is more than assumed streaming content is the industry standard. VHS/Betamax is dinosaur technology. But isn't movie theater tech even older? Not everyone can afford the steadily escalating prices of streaming and the theater. But when reaching out to DVD companies, most wouldn't even respond, one did saying it was industry standard to classify captions like bloopers and ""on-demand"" was the direction where you get just the TV show or movie. Nothing else. Not even captions.

This is not only the case of watching a program from 50 years ago with a DVD release 25 years ago and not have the captions. This is now involving shows released this decade and not having the captions. When and why did ""accessible for all"" exclude people who value or have no choice but the DVD release? Especially since DVDs remain to be manufactured, just like DVD players this present year?

I have been questioned about my TV/DVD setup. Granted I do have a 17 year old TV/DVD combo, but before one chooses to say that is the problem exclusively, I was introduced to a Youtube video that showed someone purchasing a 2025 DVD Player that wasn't enabling the captions. So it is not simply user error as that video went in great detail about how this became a problem and leaving the deaf and hard of hearing behind with these omissions. Many players are responsible but for some unclear reason DVDs were exempted and I cannot get anyone to explain why.

So I have sought out advocacy organizations and politicians hoping to get better understanding of the existing omission as well as support to correct the problem. I have gone to ecommerce sites and read through many comments of people buying a DVD that listed as having captions only to not have them - and the product was non-refundable. And not available on any streaming network.

 Unfortunately, it has not been a pleasant experience getting advocates on this matter. One even stated they only watched movies through streaming almost as if to say not my problem. However the same person advocated open captions in movie theaters, so I did not understand the enthusiasm in one area and none in the other. 

I am coming here looking for guidance, input, and understanding. How to get interest and advocacy that supports both the deaf and hard of hearing beyond the voice of one for DVDs. Have you noticed this? Does this bother you or someone you know? 

Trying to open the conversation here...

Thank you.

It wouldn’t be legally considered publicly facing video. We’re granted captioned access to captioned videos at government owned sites (museums and anything else publicly owned) and employment videos to give us equal access to those things. If you were to purchase one of those things or for some reason were given a copy those would also have to come with captions. 

Whenever you buy a DVD copy of a movie or television show you’re no longer buying public facing video, you’re buying a licensed copy of a privately owned video. The government isn’t allowed to trample all over corporate rights and force them to caption copies of their media. It’s an inconvenience to have a closed caption decoder but the government likely will never step in when it comes to purchased media.

I don't have anything to offer here. But, I assume the YouTube video you mentioned is from Technology Connections. The video was interesting.

https://youtu.be/OSCOQ6vnLwU

The only time I've had an issue is with third party sellers. My issue with amazon goes back far enough that I've refused to buy electronics from them, as well - no need to risk burning my house down because I missed the fine print on something that I could have bought from a reputable seller.

Not helpful, I know. This issue has burned my nerves for years but I don't have much else to add. :/

I saw the other thread. I gotta say I've been sailing the high seas for digital content as a means for accessibility for a couple decades at this point. Obviously not an ideal solution for the general public. (I still have a large DVD and Blu-Ray collection and pay for multiple streaming services) Streaming is a stop gap but I remember when I got Paramount Plus and the timing for all of the subtitles were so far off that it was unwatchable. I had to source other means even when I was paying money for it. They later fixed it. I also remember the early days of Netflix streaming when most of their content didn't have subtitles.

Legislation might help but I have no idea for how much longer we will have physical media.

I know it's not great but your best option might be a computer with a DVD/Blu-Ray drive and software that supports all caption/subtitle formats. I think VLC media player now has AI subtitle support.

Recently my hearing aids got broke. It was my own fault unfortunately - I was doing the dishes and wanted to talk to a friend. Next thing I know my aids are drowning in a sink of dirty dish water. That said, my Insurance is refusing to cover replacements at the moment. They gave me some bureaucratic bullshit of only covering one every X years and that they 'Weren't a medical necessity for my life' (I can 'get by' in in-person conversations through a mix of lip reading and context, as well as being able to make out \~50% of words. I heavily regret saying that when I was first looked at but what can ya do...) so now... 

**I need some advice on Cheap Hearing Aids I can buy myself.**

I work with kids, I live in a rural area, I *need* to have my ears sometimes and I don't mind shelling out a bit of money, but at the end of the day I just don't have the funds to cover my nice ones again all on my own. Nor do I have the money to be shite at my job until my insurance comes around. Any advice helps!!!

First of all, have you checked if you’re hearing aids are under warranty? My insurance covers hearing aids more frequently than my warranty runs out. If they aren’t under warranty, or the warranty doesn’t cover water damage, your best bet is probably Costco

Are you in the US? If so, you can check with your state's vocational rehab office for assistance. My state provides hearing aids and college tuition for deaf/hard of hearing residents that want to work or go to school. But you have to open a case and ask.

Alternatively, if you have an HSA or FSA account, you can use that for purchasing hearing aids. You will at least save money on income taxes.

Another option is to apply for CareCredit.

You can also check out CostCo. They will have the best pricing.

1l3r2o4,hardofhearing,Dual language 4 yo with unilateral hearing impairment,"Hi there, I’m hoping someone can help and describe any experiences they have with dual language and hearing loss. 

Background information, my husband and I both work in education and educational research. We have a good understanding of the benefits of dual language and I have worked in bilingual schools for a long time. Our son will have an opportunity to go to a dual language 50/50 immersion school next year for kinder. I am really on the fence about it because he is in a preschool-8th grade school that he really loves. My husband and I aren’t fluent in the minority language, so he might have limited practice outside of school. I know he is capable of learning a second language but I’m not sure if this is the best route for him. 

Does anyone in this group have any experience with having a unilateral hearing impairment and doing dual language? 

What was your experience like? What things should I consider when deciding? 

[댓글]
I think it is important to consider his history with hearing loss which is missing here. What is the degree of HL, when was he diagnosed and how has he been doing since diagnosis? A child who is recently diagnosed, let's say, with severe unilateral HL  due to illness and still adjusting perhaps with HAs and someone who has had unilateral moderate congenital deafness will experience similar challenges differently. At 4, the kind of support will he be receiving from school and at home to facilitate his learning will be key.

I am also wondering about the two languages.

Dual language like English and ASL?

I have mild to moderate hearing loss, can generally hear deeper voices well, but not higher ones (so women and kids tend to be challenging). I learnt a second language as an adult to support a passion of my husband’s. Whilst I could read it quite well and speak it reasonably well (understandably but not quite accurately), I could never hear it. That left me fairly isolated unless they could speak my language fluently. 

It might depend on the level of loss your child has. I’m wishing I knew sign language in spite of the fact that my loss isn’t that bad on paper. Please keep in mind that your child will already have communication issues and likely feel isolated at times. How much more isolated will they feel not being able to speak the native language fluently? There’s a good chance that they’ll struggle more as they get older (a recent post discusses the effect of exhaustion and isolation from deafness, I think we were all in our forties as well). Might they benefit from sign language too? 

I’m absolutely not encouraging you to take one path or the other, I’m hoping to play devil’s advocate so you know what the risks are. I hope you can make the best choice for your child and your family ☺️

Hi there! I have a 4 year old with moderate unilateral hearing loss (just diagnosed) who is in a dual language immersion class.  She is doing wonderfully and there is no issue. My husband and I don't speak the language either.

The background is that my daughter has no history of speech and language delays and does well academically. Our audiologist said her hearing loss should not impact her participation in a dual language immersion program. She is slowly starting to wear her hearing aid and should be wearing it full time in September.

Can you speak with your Audiologist about this? Does your child have any speech and language delays? Are you also learning sign language? Will your child have a hearing aid? Does your child seem to have typical academic abilities for their age?  These are all factors to consider.

My son just turned 5 and sounds like a similar background in terms of hearing loss. Diagnosed at birth, hearing aids since 6 months. Severe loss in 1 ear, mild loss in the other ear. We mainly speak English at home (some Spanish, I am native but my husband is not) and live in a multilingual country. Neither me or my husband speak the local languages. 
He can speak 2 of the local languages, plus the local sign language plus English. He is starting to learn Spanish and the third local language. He has a hard time pronouncing some sounds but totally intelligible when he speaks. Sometimes he code switches to sign when he can’t find the word or is tired, sometimes he code switches to local language if it is something he learned at school and doesn’t know the translation to English. My point is - it is a beautiful multilingual mess and he is killing it!  Please please add sign language - I cannot tell you how beneficial it is for him. He has an interpreter that signs with him at school to get him used to that kind of communication for the future and he comes home to teach us new signs he has learned. Then we all say it in the languages we know. He learned sign before he could use words so it is super important for us to keep that going - signing was the first way he communicated with us and it changed our lives!

I was born deaf in my left ear in another country. When we immigrated to the US I didn’t speak a word of English. A year later I was fluent in it even though I wasn’t even diagnosed yet so didn’t have any help. A year later I was fluent in English because of being in school everyday. I wasn’t even diagnosed 9 years old at that time. I believe you should expose him to other languages as early as possible because it’s much easier for him to learn at an early age than to wait until high school or later. I have younger cousins born in America who learned both languages at the same time.

We have a 2yo with a similar hearing profile - also aided since 6mo. We are raising him trilingual - our local sign, English and Chinese. In our culture in my home country, having both English and a mother tongue is - while not 100% essential - helpful to connect with the rest of the community so most kids are raised bilingual from birth. 

He’s struggled a little with the tones (but so do most toddlers, anyway) but because we have sign, we sim-com (sign and speak at the same time) in the third language (Chinese) and that has helped tremendously.

Go for it! But also consider adding sign to that mix :)",2025-06-05 05:15:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l3r2o4/dual_language_4_yo_with_unilateral_hearing/
1l35rnk,hardofhearing,Learning ASL and signing through game!,"Hi everybody, I really hope I am allowed to post this here. If not, my apologies. I'm a 24 year-old student in The Netherlands finishing up my graduation and currently working on a game designed to help people get in touch with sign language. Through storytelling, for example, players will learn signs and how to use them. An educational game presented in an entertaining way. 

Here's the thing: **your opinion matters!** Although I do not have hearing problems myself, I find it extremely important to close the language gap between people that are HOH/deaf and people that aren't. With around 48 million people in the US experiencing hearing impairment and/or being HOH/deaf, how much representation do we see in the media? And how much easier could day to day life become if more people knew basic sign language? 

  
I have created a small form with some questions that would really help my research and game development. My goal is to create a physical/analog game, most likely with the use of cards. But as for now, I'm open to all possibilities. If possible, it would mean the world to me if you could fill in the form linked below and share it with others. Thank you so much in advance!

So why are you using ASL instead of SLN? Are you fluent in either? Teaching sign language when you’re not connected to the Deaf community and not fluent in sign language is very harmful to Deaf and hard of hearing people. There’s a reason your post was removed from r/deaf.

1l2j16h,hardofhearing,Help a parent of a 5 year old navigate her unilateral deafness,"My daughter was recently discovered to be deaf in one ear. We looked into a cochlea implant which sounded like the best option but the MRI showed no nerve going to her cochlea.

We are now back at square one trying to determine next steps. I was wondering if anyone has good input or advice when it comes to the Edit: ~~bone-anchored~~ bone conduction implant (the doctor mentioned Osia implants) compared to the hearing aids.

Also, I'd really appreciate hearing what it is like to live with unilateral hearing loss. It's really difficult to know if some of her focusing/paying attention challenges are her age, personality, or hearing loss.

Thank you

Whatever aid you choose. You must MUST 1000%.  To give her sign langague.   as the main langague or at least a hard 2nd. because her ears don't work. So that means hearing a langaugue  is pointless.  And even with surgery if she qualifies for any of those it will never be clear muddle sounding at best. 

There are studies and research that show that if you don't give access to sign langague then the reading and writing of English will never be on par. 

Deaf/hard of hearing high school who graduate. Graduate with a 3rd/4th grade reading and writing level of English. Newspapers are set to the standard of 8th grade understanding of English. 

I am hard of hearing and I have sensornal bilateral. Moderate level. And uses hearing aids.  Fluent in English and in sign langauge.

you may want to look into working with a teacher for the deaf/hard of hearing (TODHH) in your local school system. if your child is not in school yet, you can still reach out for a referral to early childhood special education. I am DHH (bilateral) and am also a TODHH, and have worked with a lot of unilaterally deaf students. I have one now, going into 4th grade, who is in the same situation as your daughter in terms of no auditory nerve on one side. he uses CROS hearing  aids and gets good benefit from those, but everyone is different. he used to wear bone conduction hearing aid, but his access to speech, especially in the classroom, is greatly improved with the CROS hearing aids over the bone conduction.

with unilateral hearing loss, difficulties with attention and focus can absolutely be apparent. it's already hard to pay attention to what people are saying when you are young, so add in that she is only hearing on one side and it's even more challenging. listening in background noise can be very difficult; filtering out background noise to focus on priority speech, like hearing your parents in a restaurant, can be hard. that's where it gets challenging in a classroom, too. also, difficulties with localization, or knowing where sound is coming from.
but again, a TODHH would be such a good advocate and resource for you!

best of luck with your child and this journey - I know it's a big adjustment and it can seem scary, but the DHH community is so rich and vibrant, and everything is going to work out. you're just going to have to be an active learner and a good advocate, like you already are doing, especially while your child is learning how to advocate on their own.

Our child is unilaterally Deaf. I can't speak to bone conduction, but have been doing this for many years now. Can share some of our experience. 

The symptoms of unilateral Deafness are very very similar to adhd, in our experience. Which was made even more difficult by a diagnosis of, you guessed it,  adhd. The main similarities were:

- sensory overload (need breaks from loud, busy places)

- fatigued after loud environment (needs quiet alone time after school or social event)

- missing instructions or parts of instructions (needs written instructions, rubrics, etc)

- not listening/hearing someone unless they get their attention first and they are looking directly at the speaker (needs preferential seating on correct side, reminders to teachers to get their attention bf speaking directly to them)

Some things specific to being Deaf:

- can't localize sounds, makes finding things difficult (beeping on ""find the remote/phone""), traffic (so stressful as a parent)

- missing initial/final sounds of words, made spelling and some articulation difficult

- mishearing words/phrases

If you're working with a children's hospital for services, I'd ask to speak with the social worker. They may be able to put you in touch with families in a similar situation to yours.

Whatever you end up choosing, PLEASE use sign language. My parents never bothered signing with me and I knew MINIMAL sign up until my freshman year of high school. PLEASE USE SIGN LANGUAGE. I have bilateral hearing loss and I wear hearing aids. I wish I knew more sign language because I struggle so much. Especially with remembering to charge my aids, then not being able to hear for the whole day. I definitely suggest learning from Deaf content creators if you don't wanna pay for an app. Never learn from hearing people

I was born with my left ear completely deaf. My family never figured it out and when I eventually figured it out myself that it wasn’t normal I never told anyone. The things to focus on is for school like her seating in the classroom should be where the teacher is on her “ good side”. It’s hard to understand what people are saying when she’s in groups and also in a loud area like a restaurant or a party. Build her self confidence so that she doesn’t shy away from asking people to repeat something she may not have heard. 
As far as Hearing aids the Osia implant is the most recent technology that will carry the sound through bone conduction from her deaf side to her hearing side and that will help her understand speech better especially when someone is sitting on her bad side. Once I was diagnosed I got what’s called CROS hearing aids. They are fitted in both ears. CROS stands for Countralateral Routing of Signal. The bad ear aid is a transmitter and the good ear one is a receiver. The sound on her bad side gets transmitted to her good side. It’s not so great in all situations. I used to turn mine off in crowds unless someone was sitting right next to me on my deaf side. 
Another thing to keep in mind is that with just one good ear she won’t be able to locate where sound is coming from. So if she’s walking down the hall and someone calls her name she might hear it but she won’t know which direction the sound is coming from. That’s most important when you’re teaching her about crossing the street. She needs to use her eyes more than her hearing to trust that there is no cars coming especially on her deaf side. When you’re at home and you are in different rooms and you call her for something make sure you have eye contact when telling her things, that will help in distinguishing what’s “behavioral” not listening to you versus she really couldn’t understand what you were saying from the next room. Mostly just enjoy your daughter any other child. Help her to understand that she may have trouble hearing but that she can depend on you to be ok when she asks you to repeat yourselves.

[deleted]

My nephew has severe hearing loss in one ear, and even with his hearing aid he can't understand people sitting on that side when they are talking. 

But he's lived a normal hearing life and has a Masters from Northeastern and a very good job. 

So while you should do everything you can to provide sound to that ear, and to protect the hearing in the other ear, I think that a fairly normal life is possible.

Audiologist here. 

For my unilaterally deaf patients I always recommend a trial with a CROS system first because you can always return the CROS. The Osia is also a power sucker and takes a 675 ""implant plus"" battery and it will only last 2 days per battery. Vs a traditional hearing aid battery which can either be recharged nightly or a replaceable battery that can be exchanged once every 5-10 days depending on battery selection. 

OP I'd personally go with a CROS system on trial basis first because she'll be getting the same benefits from either the Cros System or the Osia, except the CROS is non-invasive.

This is spot on. Been unilaterally deaf lol my life.  Much can be done for the child but mostly the family must also engage.  No more talking without eye contact, ensuring all family members take a full communication approach (sign and speech and body language) Socilisation for the child with other HH/ Deaf children.  Oh How I wish people knew this of me when I was a child in the 60’ and 70’- thought for years I wasn’t as smart or as normal as the other children. I wasn’t actually very intelligent as I manoeuvred this world by hearing only 50% - I remeber my attention wanning to the window or day dreaming when the teacher turned to the board … I failed miserably in school until I developed coping techniques.  Work with your child at finding coping techniques and focus less on the “technical solutions “

As a DHH teacher with a hearing loss, I found my students and their parents appreciated my perspective. Can your audiologist refer you to a group of individuals who have dealt with this?",2025-06-03 18:09:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l2j16h/help_a_parent_of_a_5_year_old_navigate_her/
1l2ejsm,hardofhearing,Hearing aids,"Does any find hearing aids on enhance the sounds that annoy them? They seem to make my tinnitus worse or louder and not enhance the frequencies I need to hear.

[댓글]
Yes I do love my hearing aids but not in all environments, for example, in cars. Hate the extra noises like in my car the diff is noisy, which I can hear if I've got HAs on plus the ear facing the window gets all the wind noise but not the other ear so it's weird and unbalanced. Though unlike you they get rid of my tinnitus as I've got a tinnitus mask and it's been amazing to have breaks from that. It has taken a few adjustments at audiologist to get them how I like them though.

Yes. I've been thinking of not wearing mine permanently for this reason. All the rackety things intrude too harshly.

My hearing aids are fine if I use the Speech in Noise programme. I find they make me more able to tolerate background noise - unless the speech frequencies are amplified I get really stressed out by it.

I do find that my tinnitus is worse when I take them out. That's why I'm awake at this stupid hour. My audiologist told me that if I wear them all day every day it should improve, but sadly this hasn't been my experience.

I hate the sound of running water when I wear them. Without them it sounds normal, but with them on it sounds way too loud and hurts my ears.

How bout that sound of a raindrop hitting \*exactly\* on the mics for our hearing aids. It sounds like getting hit by a jello blob to me.

Yes, initially I was hearing all the odd sounds, but you will get used to it and suddenly you will be able to hear. It's weird, like one day I just started to hear right.",2025-06-03 15:16:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l2ejsm/hearing_aids/
1l1tvtg,hardofhearing,Kid doesn’t want to wear hearing aids,"Okay, so my kid (12M) hates wearing his hearing aids. I can usually get him to wear them at school with no problem, but lately it’s been so hard. 

He wasn’t born needing them— he had cancer at 4 years old resulting in high frequency hearing loss &amp; getting his hearing aids at age 5. The hearing aids are super cool with Bluetooth and everything else. He claims he can hear just fine without them, but it’s hard for me to fully understand what he can or can’t hear based off of the audiogram and since he claims he doesn’t need them, he isn’t the greatest about communicating what he actually hears or not. And also like he’s 12, so are you not hearing me or are you just not paying attention? Lmao.

Anyways, he plays baseball (all the way out in right field) &amp; I tried to convince him to wear them out there because I think it’d help him hear whatever his teammates are communicating and/or when he’s running bases. He says the wind is too loud with them in?

What I guess I’m asking with this post is, should I force him to wear them? I don’t really want the “you’re the parent and he’s a child” stuff. I know, but I also want to understand where he’s coming from. I want him to know I am listening to him. Can someone else with high frequency hearing loss maybe explain this to me? I also think some people assume he’s fully deaf when they see his hearing aids or ask kind of stupid questions, which probably pisses him off. 

EDIT: Thank you for all of your inputs &amp; sharing your experiences with me! I tried to attach a link for his recent audiogram.

I was born deaf, got hearing aids at five years old. I wore them most of the time but when I hit teenage hood, I too felt like ""I could hear fine without them.""

The truth was no, I could not. I think it's a rebellious thing. You kinda wanna prove that you're cool/tough/independent enough without them. Something like that. You don't actually think about your motivations, you just decide not to wear them and feel irritation at the thought of it and you're not sure why. 

In my case, my friends would get so angry at me for not wearing them because I would ask them to repeat stuff all the time and they would have to speak up a lot. I also ended up missing a lot of stuff in class and at events.

I got to a point in late high school/early university where my fear of missing out on things won out over my rebelliousness. Also, my desire not to piss off my friends.

I wear my hearing aids all the time now (when I'm out with people anyway, at home I prefer the peace and quiet). I'm in my thirties by the by. 

This is just to say, you might need to let him mess up a little. He'll either learn that he doesn't like going without them or be very stubborn until it becomes a genuine problem but if you force him to wear them, he'll bear a grudge against you and resentment towards the aids.

That being said, a little pushing is fine. I've been accused of being too acquiescing sometimes so take my advice with a grain of salt.  

Best of luck to you. I hope kiddo gets the message sooner than I did.

I'm sort of confused as to why he would need to be ""forced"" to wear them. I'm young, 21, have had a severe-profound high frequency loss since the age of 5, and have gotten through my life reasonably fine for how dramatic my loss is. People are shocked to find out that I even have a loss. Do you happen to have a picture of his audiogram that you can attach? We'd be happy to help interpret it for you.

High frequencies are tied to consonant clarity (i.e., s-, sh-, f-, ch-, etc.). People with high-frequency losses can still hear and understand a large portion of speech, especially with added context. 

There's really not enough context here to suggest anything about your son specifically. It could be tied to being embarrassed for having HAs at his age, improper programing that needs to be adjusted with an audiologist (wind reduction features exist in most modern HAs), or that they simply don't provide him with any ""huge"" benefits, so much so that the benefit isn't worth the embarassment/discomfort.

The best thing you can do is ask questions. Have him write down a list of all the things that are too loud, too quiet, too annoying, or too emphasized; with that list, show it to an audiologist who can interpret it and make proper changes in the programming software.

The wind is too loud with hearing aids. Its annoying as shit. Also the hearing aids introduce a degree of latency which probably prevents him from estimating direction/distance. If he wants to leave his hearing aids out thats his decision and you should respect that

Have you gotten a second opinion on his audiogram and hearing aid settings? 

Our teen was telling us the HA did nothing and the audiologist kept telling us the audiograms with vs without the HA indicated it was working. The ENT suggested CI based on their testing, so we compared. The audiologist was actually FLIPPING the results. The HA literally did NOTHING.  I'm not suggesting this is happening, but your child is telling you they don't want it for a reason. I'd rule out functionality of the HA.

As someone who got hearing aids at 10, 32 years ago now:

Sometimes they are exhausting. Wearing them all day is exhausting and listening to people is absolutely exhausting.

As a hearing aid wearer and have played baseball around that age, you should be asking yourself if the team player are communicating with him without the dependency of hearing aids (visual cues or sign language, etc) because whatcha gonna do if the hearing aid batteries are dead or if it’s too windy to be able to hear anything or if it’s light rain, you expect him to wear hearing aids?

The hearing aids are for situational awareness, not for you to overly rely on him to accommodate your communication preferences because it’s convenient for you instead of useful for your son. 

By the way, some audiologists can mimic his experience with wearing hearing aids and if they’re unable to, then wear airpods all the time to get a slight sense of where he’s coming from.

There can be several factors playing into this. Is it possible he really doesn’t need them? Maybe. But around this age especially wearing hearing aids and being different is hard, and a lot of hearing aid user (myself included!) went through a “phase” where I resented having to wear them and went without. It’s also possible he needs an adjustment or especially playing baseball the wind static can be a lot. I’d encourage you to follow up with audiology and make sure the settings are okay. Try to have an honest talk with him about if hearing loss is making aspect of life difficult- if people have commented negatively on his hearing aids, if he’s missing things in class or conversations, if he doesn’t wear them to people get annoyed with him asking to repeat things, etc. I worked on peds oncology for a while and definitely can get that sometimes once in remission, kids want to be as normal as possible and don’t want anything else drawing attention to them. There are a lot of options now to customize hearing aids and make them more fun. As an adult, the embarrassment has worn off and I like wearing them when I can make them look a little more fancy! This is a shop I love: the covers block out wind/ static noise and they have baseball themed covers your kiddo might like!!

I'm in my 30s and also have high frequency loss. In my 20s tried wearing hearing aids for a few years, but ultimately decided not to keep wearing them. A few audiologists have told me this is common for loss like this, because while hearing aids CAN be tuned to only emphasize some sound, they are best used to amplify everything. So if you have normal hearing in some frequencies...hearing aids can still work, but they can be annoying. There's no better solution, though. Maybe better tuning like a few other commenters said but for me, over 2 years, tuning didn't seem to matter. When I pointed out that wind crackling was annoying or speech in restaurants was louder without being clearer, they said that's just how it's going to be, and I can mess with the app settings or whatever for the situation. For me, that wasn't worth it. 

All that said, I would try making him stick with it for at least a couple years. There's a learning curve to hearing with aids and you want to make sure he's given them a fair shot.

I relate to your kid. I had hearing aids since I was in 9th grade, and at the start I wore them outside and at home. However, wearing them outside didn't last long because some sounds hurt my ear e.g. honking of cars, church bells, etc. I also found that I can get by fine without them cause most of my loss were in high frequency sound. I was also conscious of wearing them in public. 

During the pandemic, I began to wear them again in public because I thought it would help me hear people even if they have face masks on (I can't lipread cos I can't see their lips). But, that wasn't the case. It only amplified the sounds and did not really help me understand what people were saying. So, I just didn't wear them at all. When the use of face masks eased, I absolutely saw no reason to wear my hearing aids at all because I could get by fine. All these times, my mother also kept reminding me to wear hearing aids to the point where I also felt that my choice to not wear one isn't respected. It became annoying because my mother couldn't understand that my hearing aids don't work for me, I just get irritated and tired of the loud sounds I hear. I prefer the quiet. My mother also didn't seem to get that it only amplifies sound and doesn't help me understand people when I can't read their lips. My audiologist as well kept pushing me to wear them even though I already said these same reasons to her. Overall, it was very frustrating when people kept forcing me to wear them when they can't understand the reasons why I don't.

Eventually, my old hearing aids broke and I have to get a new one. The audiologist, of course, suggested me a new hearing aid. But, I was on the fence about getting them because not only were they expensive, but also I still had the thought that they won't help me much—there isn't a difference to wearing hearing aids or not because they still only amplify sounds and not help me understand people who have face masks on.

Not until I met a new audiologist, and there I found hearing aids and the settings that work for me. I finally saw how the hearing aids were supposed to aid me, which wasn't clear to me before with my old hearing aids and audiologist. With my new ones, I could finally engage in conversation with people who have face masks on at any distance. That's all I ever wanted really, and I cried when I finally got to experience the real benefits of the hearing aids. The background noise was also toned down, which really helped because BG noise can be the main source of fatigue or irritation to people with hearing loss. Now, I'm now more amenable to wearing hearing aids, as I can finally see their purpose and how it serves me.

Maybe your kid feels the same. That's why I agree to get a second opinion on a different audiologist or fine tune the hearing aid settings to adjust to your kid's needs. Let him test different hearing aids/settings! Your kids feelings are valid, he just needs to explore more options and see what works for him and doesn't. If it still isn't for him, I think you should respect that.

Is wind noise the only reason why he doesn’t want to wear them? Do they make him “feel different” and this is avoidance? Is he getting bullied?

As a hearing aid wearer with the same type of hearing loss, I think you should talk to him. He might be a teenager, he might hate you but there's nothing as sad as silently losing your hearing. 
I'm 24, I got my hearing aids at 19 and the campus fun and stuff made me hate wearing them. After all my friends were accommodating and they understood me. But in hindsight I wish I wore them. In those around 4 years of not wearing them, I've lost a significant amount of my hearing that will never recover. So now I try as much as possible to put them on and benefit fully from them. 
And it's hard fr, I hate the fatigue. I left my job so I could just sit and relearn how to hear💔so I do give myself some grace and breaks. But I hope it gets better.

It sounds like his hearing aids need to be adjusted by his audiologist. They're probably picking up/emphasizing the wrong sounds - like wind - instead of his teammates' voices. Explain all of this to the audio.

~~Not wearing them obviously isn't and shouldn't be an option.~~ Thanks to everyone who posted their own experiences. 

Also, he's 12 and kids suck, so that doesn't help. Some of them might be genuinely curious, but others are probably being little assholes.

Edit: Why was this downvoted? People on Reddit, I swear!

How frequently does he go in for tunings, and do you go with him? I would take note of how descriptive he is when his audiologist asks for feedback. Does he have a program that's optimized for the listening situations where he's reluctant to wear his HA?

I was 8 when I got my first pair. I was 12 before I started wearing them regularly. Kids go through adjust and rebellion stages, especially in the world of social peer pressure and desire to fit in. Let your son learn the hard way while he is young and has your support and supervision. My parents stopped nagging me and just let me be. And I got a teacher who was so soft spoken I couldn't even hear the quiz questions let alone write down the answer. Aftet the second test being graded 0/F, I put on my hearing aids and kept them on at school. 

I do sympathize with his complaint about wind though; it is bloody annoying and overtakes any speech. I am a rower and I chose to not wear my HAs when working out. But instead of trying to go to the audiologist to tune the HAs, take him to the appointment and tell him it is up to him to troubleshoot and problem solve with the audiologist. And maybe the solution they come up with may be to not wear HAs but for him to work with his coach and team to ensure he can communicate as a team member. Either way, it is a good learning opportunity for him to work through his hearing adjustments and needs with professionals himself.

Sorry for the length, I'm not very good at reddit. Everyone's experience is definitely different. I agree that communicating with him directly about why he doesn't like wearing them is super important. 

I just got hearing aids in my 30s, but honestly needed them around 15 or so. I am still shocked with how much they changed/improved my life.

I love my hearing aids and had no idea just how much I wasn't hearing all the time! I also didn't realize how often others were having to repeat themselves and how much energy and frustration went into communication. 😞 I would love to go back in time and get them sooner. 

They do have several drawbacks. Wind is a huge issue for me. Mine do have Bluetooth which is great, but I can't have phone calls outside because the mic picks up so much wind noise. Not only is that noise unpleasant and annoying and makes it impossible to hear anybody, it is actually painful to me [and to those on the other line who can also hear it]. My hair also touches the mic constantly. I've given up and now wear my hair in bandanas or ponytails or both 100% of the time. The constant rustling sound is actually maddening! It gives me weird anxiety and it is frustrating and exhausting to constantly have to deal with that. The mic even as advanced as it is, squeals when anything gets close to it [which can be embarrassing socially and also physically painful] If he's wearing a helmet, it wouldn't surprise me at all if he gets squealing/feedback/whining noises regularly and is over it.

Another factor might also be that when you wear them, at least for me, I couldn't tell what some sounds even were at first! [Like the AC kicking on, the ice maker dropping ice, cars passing outside, I hadn't really heard any of it for a long time, so I was constantly feeling crazy! Like, wtf is that sound!?! My husband had to answer a ton of questions about sounds in my first 6 months wearing them. It may also be that the sounds are unpleasant, overstimulating and loud in a way that's not helpful. A ball game has insane levels of noise! I don't think I would wear mine in that situation. Bc all the b.s. noise will drown out what I actually do need to hear.

Lastly, my dad and his mom had profound hearing loss. They both refuse/d to wear their HA. For them they got so used to the quiet that the aids made every thing way too fucking loud. He likes his peace and quiet. My mom is a shouter. The aids would help him talk to others, but everything [including her] is just way too loud for him. He nods and pretends he understands. I know his face well so I can definitely tell when he is connecting and when he is not. He also was very aware how expensive they were and after losing a pair at work in an accident he refused to ""waste money"" on that again.

If you can find out what he doesn't like about them, the audiologist may be able to make adjustments. If they don't fit well and make his ears sore, they can do custom moulds of his canal. If he's getting rashes and itching ears he may need to replace his ear cushions more frequently or even get treated for skin infections. [I get dermatitis &amp; sometimes mild fungal infections from mine and have to use cream every few months to clear it up]. They may need to adjust his sound balance and work on making speech clearer and background noise less in the forefront. 

A lot of people think that hearing aids fix everything with sound, but they really only amplify things. Even with my aids I still have to read lips. I still sit so that the quieter friends are on my ""good"" side. I have to ask ppl to turn their music off bc if they're talking, I can't understand them over even quiet background music. It's honestly frustrating with or without the aids. It's exhausting with or without them. So if he's fed up, he may also just need a break all together from them. I've started taking sound breaks lately bc I'm just so irritated by everything around me.

I hope you both can have some good conversations about his experience and what he's going through. As a cancer survivor, he may also just crave a sense of ""normalcy"" and wearing his aids could be a constant reminder of everything he went through already. 

Best of luck!

hi, not really advice but perspective. when i started middle school i did not want to go in being the glasses / braces / hearing aid girly so i begged my parents to not wear them. we ultimately landed on if i kept up good grades i didn't have to. i went from 13 to 21 without hearing aids. it wasn't until a college course that i really could not understand a teacher that i decided to pursue them again. i was mortified when i finally got them. it had been so long i forgot what it was like. i realized then how difficult i had made life for myself. i have no idea where i could be had i just worn them, i think my life would be incredibly different. HOWEVER, though i regret the possibilities and lament over the unnecessary struggle i made myself unwittingly endure, i am still a successful person with a happy, and loving, social life. at the end of the day i don't think my parents could have done anything differently, i dont even associate them with my decision not to wear them, as it was my own decision, 12 y/o or not.

I can back him up with the wind being loud, the wind is very loud. This is how I explain hearing aids to people, is that imagine your hearing everything through a radio or phone all the time, you can get feedback (for example whistling, though I don’t think you should be getting it normally, but it can happen is somethings wrong with the hearing aid and you don’t know it), if anything rubs against it you can hear it, and you can definitely hear the wind. I’ve taken my hearing aids out so many times because of it.

I think you shouldn’t force him to wear it. I can’t speak too much for childhood (I only got hearing aids like this year at 19) because Ive had hearing loss all my life but I never wanted to get hearing aids, only because I thought they’d be a sensory nightmare for me (I wasn’t too wrong but I was deffo being dramatic😂), but no one forced me to get them, which I was very greatful for. It’s the same with glasses, I had them but no one forced me to wear them.

My parents were quite neglectful with a lot of things that I needed as a chronically ill child but one good thing is that they always gave me a sense of bodily autonomy. If anything was happening to me, for example getting an xray or a scan or a cannula, they would make sure someone explained what was happening and why they were doing it. With things that were optional they allowed my input and took it into consideration (one thing was braces like knee braces and such, I didn’t want to wear them but we talked and they and my PT figured out it wasn’t the actual braces, it was the colour, so we got colourful braces instead).

The best thing you can do is try explain why he needs them, but if he doesn’t want to wear them allow him to have that choice. I know personally that if braces or glasses or hearing aids were forced on me then I wouldn’t wear them now.

(I also want to add that everyone has different experiences with things, this is just my personal experience)

A possibility- if he’s not interested in the HAs, he could explore ASL and learn to embrace his lack of hearing. Could be beneficial down the line if the hearing loss progresses as well.

Hearing aid skins can help cut down wind noise, they also help repellent dirt, sweat, and moisture. Your son can pick out his favorite color or print to have some fun. Could make his devices a little more appealing- if that works they sell ear tubes and such, mine are bright green and I love them. People don't even realize they are hearing aides half the time.  (I have posted them on my profile before)

Search hearing aids on etsy for ways to have fun/dress up you son's. He could pick out device safe stickers, etc.

When I was 11 around the same age I got my first pair of hearing aids too but I didn’t put up a fight because I knew I needed them and I was quite grateful and happy, I’m 16 now. Your son is just being a brat lmao.",2025-06-02 21:13:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l1tvtg/kid_doesnt_want_to_wear_hearing_aids/

[댓글]
I can't hear on the phone anymore. People don't seem to understand how to accomplish things without one, though. I have to get family to call for me but they don't like it. Sucks.

Bluetooth hearings have helped me somewhat. It’s still a challenge. I sometimes use Caption Call if it’s a very important call…but some people get annoyed by the delay in answers while I wait for their dialogue to be captioned.

Not a huge fan of phone calls. my difficulty with them was one of the clues. 

The caption app helps, but my hearing aids are wonky with bluetooth - they use the HA microphones, which work kinda okay in a totally silent environment, but if there's any noise at all, the person on the other end can barely hear anything I say, so... not ideal.

I sometimes tell people I am hard of hearing and use a captioning app, but then they just talk to me like. I. can. only. use. small. words.

Time to sign up for an IP relay. You are exactly who the system is made for.

I use Bluetooth feature for my calls (phone and laptop). I can’t otherwise hear great. I love closed captions when possible as well.

I wish I could text to make appointments, it drives me crazy. I have to put it on speaker too just to properly hear people. And for whatever reason whenever I try to get a job, they often want to interview me over the phone before the next interview step.

1l0u70t,hardofhearing,Left ear feels clogged but it's not and I'm extremely dizzy,"So about two days ago I woke up and my left ear felt a bit clogged, so then I tried to get the earwax out and there was none of it. I figured it would go away eventually and so I just went on with my day. Then yesterday I woke up and my head was spinning, I could barely walk, I was tripping over anything and I felt nauseous. I had to lay on my bed staying a as I possibly could for the dizziness to stop even a little, but everytime I moved my head I felt like I was spinning in circles. 

Eventually, I vomitted and it helped me feel better, but I was still a bit nauseous and dizzy. At the end of that day I noticed that my ear still felt clogged. I figured I slept on it wrong(that's happened before), so I went back to sleep once again expecting to feel better in the morning. 

  
Now, it's the morning, and my ear feels even more clogged and I can barely hear anything out of it. Sounds going to that ear sound muffled, yet loud. I can barely hear my mom talking to me through that ear, but I can hear the unusually loud sound of my pillow cover rustling whenever I move a bit.

I also can't walk that well today but I don't feel as dizzy as I did yesterday. Im not sure what's going on. If anybody can help that would be great

Sounds like an inner ear infection but I'm not a doctor so yeah, go see a doctor.

Go to the doctor.

go to the doctor. reddit aint a doctor. we just genuinely dont know enough to help you here.

There's also a condition where the crystals in the inner ear get out of place and cause nausea and dizziness.  They need repositioning and you have to find someone who knows how to do that.  You can also learn how to do it yourself.  It sounds fake and weird but I have a friend who has this happen every once in a while and it's a real pain.

1l0t1g3,hardofhearing,As a single side deafness - im struggling putting hearing aids on,"To give context to the story, based on previous medical documentation all the doctors that my parents met when I was kids I agreed that I was born with the single side deafness. But due financial issues during my childhood, could not be provided additional support. Recently after gaining health insurance, did a full diagnostic of my body, it was confirmed that I do have single side deafness and I was given a free hearing aids. However, my doctors did say that they have had patients who have single side deafness not wear hearing aids at all (important information). Do I have tried wearing hearing aids, but when I put the part of the hearing aid that goes into my ears, it hurts my ears. I tried playing around with different size ear plugs, but nothing is working. I have been not using my hearing aids more often than using it. And my friends who do wearing hearing aids are on the side that you should wear it to prevent further hearing loss.

I need an outside perspective on this situation, as anyone deal with it?

Have you gone back to your doctors and explained it hurts to put them in? It sounds like something else may be wrong?

I chose not to use any aids as an acquired SSD person.  I'm listening to music most of the day anways, I can deal with it.

It sounds like you're using the dome-style inserts. They sit in the ear canal fairly deeply. I used them for a long time and my ears always ached after a time, but I persisted. 

Originally, I had custom-fitted ear inserts but I didn't wear them because I thought they were more prone to wax build-up. Well, for the last few months I switched to my custom inserts and the pain is gone and the wax is not worse.

I'd recommend getting a custom fitting if you can. They put a thick liquid silicone in my ear and after it set, they sent it to a lab to put in a speaker and polish it. It's a process, and it's not free, but it sure made a difference for me.",2025-06-01 16:23:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l0t1g3/as_a_single_side_deafness_im_struggling_putting/
1l0k2s5,hardofhearing,Hearing issues 6 months after an ear infection,"Back in November, I got very VERY sick. And part of getting so sick was a double ear infection. I'd never had an ear infection quite as bad as this. I lost around 90-95% hearing in my right ear, and probably 50-60% in my left. I could only slightly hear some things with one ear and it was constantly uncomfortable, for about 10 days. I know that's nothing compared to what some of you deal with. But I play music, and I have major depression, and all I did was have claustrophobic panic attacks and cry my grown man ass off all day. 

Eventually, my ears started to open up and I getting them to pop and drain a bit and regain a good amount of my hearing felt like reaching the summit of Mt Everest. But eventually the progress stopped. My ears, especially my right ear, which was the worse one, have still felt full. My nose still feels full. A portion of my voice never came back. I can hear most things okay, but my own speaking is wildly uncomfortable in my own head. It vibrates my inner ear like I'm biting down on an electric toothbrush. 

I feel like it's time I do something about it, and see a doctor. And I suspect that will lead to tubes in the ears. But I've read so many stories, posts and comments here, etc. about complications from it, longterm effects, scarring, and the process itself going wrong, or not helping, or making things even worse. And most of the positive comments seem to be along the lines of ""It gets better in 6-10 months!"" No effing way. 

Moreover, I have type 1 diabetes AND lupus. (Is it any wonder I got so seriously sick back in November?) It takes me so long to heal from anything, and even a paper cut leaves a scar on me. I'm already dealing with a couple other unknown ailments that doctors seem to unable to figure out (I have appointments with the 6th AND 7th doctors currently) I'm really just fatigued, depressed, and outright drained from how bad things have gotten and the thought of putting tubes in my ears is something I don't think I can mentally handle, especially with elevated risk of major scarring and permanent hearing loss. But my right ear staying like this isn't what I want either. 

I also haven't felt like many doctors have considered how I feel. Not to shit-talk medical professionals, but I have medicaid and I sometimes feel like I'm subject to more unrelated tests and ineffective treatments than are necessary because they will 100% be paid for, even if it means I have to get more needles, more pokes and prods, more pills, etc. and ultimately come out the other side with no improvement. ESPECIALLY with my medical history of lupus and type 1 diabetes. I've developed trust issues, I suppose. 

So. Would tubes even be necessary? I don't see any other methods of dealing with this mentioned anywhere at all. I already know I can't handle losing more hearing, even if temporary. The claustrophobic meltdowns are sort've unavoidable for me from some weird CPTSD-like stuff that I won't get into.

Am I overlooking anything? Are my only options stay sorta deaf or risk going way deafer but maybe a better someday? I've felt beyond hopeless for so long and my mental health is basically nonexistent at this point. Advice is appreciated!

And sorry for the essay.

Hi. You are getting ahead of yourself. Your concerns are valid. But you first need a diagnosis of what is actually going on in your ears. You need a medical professional who knows what they are seeing to take a look in there. Make an appointment with your PCP before you start to worry about anything else.

You should find an ENT. Do lots of research before you go to one. Or go to three and see what they all say and if what they tell you matches up to the other two. If they dismiss you, NEXT. A good doctor will listen and help address all your fears. My local ENT is like this a little bit. Unrelated, I went in about my issues with not being able to breathe through my nose, and he kept dismissing me saying I was fine. I made an effort to keep bringing up my problems and he finally did a diagnostic test at the end of the appointment and completely agreed with me. He sent me to a specialist whose initial reaction when she walked in the room and saw me was “Oh wow.” As in it was apparent to her right away. Sometimes you just need to do your own research and advocate for yourself.",2025-06-01 08:33:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l0k2s5/hearing_issues_6_months_after_an_ear_infection/
1kzn0jh,hardofhearing,Why do people talk so dang much‽ ‽ ‽,"I have been bombarded lately with people talking at me (not to me, it's never a conversation) about things that either don't matter or giving me every single excruciating detail about something. 

My friends invited a person I'd never met to tag along on some adventures and I swear he never once stopped talking. I don't know how he was even breathing, there was never a gap in his yammering. 

A coworker always fills me in on needless details that don't matter and gives me word by word playbacks of conversations. She KNOWS I'm HoH and struggle with speech recognition. But, still, she yaks on and on! 

And lately, a family I love dearly has been talking incessantly about people I've never and will never meet. She goes into great detail about things that happened to these folks and it literally adds nothing of value to our conversations. 

And this is all on top of other people just blabbing away in my life: strangers, store clerks, customers at work, etc. 

It is EXHAUSTING to listen to people talk. I remind people all the time that it's mentally taxing to hold a conversation. But they still never shut up. I feel like I'm constantly bombarded with information and I just want to go live in a cave away from others and never have to hear another person say another word ever again! 

It can't just be me, right? Does anyone else experience this?

Oh my god I read your head line and I am instantly feeling this so hard! I hate it, I definitely hate it while I work and colleagues want to small talk and I can´t see their faces cause we have our desktops in front of us and I just have to concentrate so damn hard to listen to them that I don´t get my work done. 

I think it´s great that you tell people how hard it is, cause people don´t seem to get it.

Thank you so much for this! I have struggled with single sided deafness since a very young age, and your post grabbed me in such a real way. Lately its been hard to grapple with how my hearing loss has impacted me socially and you put one of the most prominent struggles into words. It might sound silly but I was almost convinced I was completely alone in feeling this way. There isnt a single soul near me who struggles with hearing loss, or at least they dont talk about it openly, and when I try to explain this to my hearing friends they dont get it.

Once I was talking to a few coworkers about my hearing loss and one said ""I remember this time one of my car speakers went out and it was so annoying I couldnt move past it."" The other guy leaned over and was like ""yeah but imagine if that was your whole life."" They both just stared off into the distance for a time. I felt a tiny spark of joy in knowing they were trying to understand, but I also see why it can be hard. I mean. I cant even begin to imagine what it must be like to hear fully.

I feel you.When your ears are working, these things don't take much processing power &amp; you hardly notice. But when your ears are off, you need to invest effort to understand and it's easy to feel you're not getting a good return on investment.

There are too many people who talk for the sake of talking, but they never actually say anything.  

I sometimes think these people have social issues though.  Even if they’re someone who doesn’t like silence, so they feel it with insufferable chatter.  There’s something not right about not feeling comfortable with silence.

I completely understand this. When I was younger I used to get sick at the drop of a hat because I spent SO much energy in a day trying to listen and hear what people said. I needed so much sleep for my body to recover.

As I’ve gotten older, I realized people are terrible at reading social cues and will keep talking until you literally excuse yourself from the conversation. This isn’t rude to do, so please don’t think that.

At work you could say to the coworker: “I’m sorry. I really need to get back to work- I have a lot on my plate.”

As for your friend of the friend: it is okay to ask him about the person he’s inviting along. What’s he/she like? How do you know them? If the friend doesn’t outright say they talk a lot, sometimes you can infer that from the way they answer the questions. It is also perfectly okay to flat out tell your friend your struggles with people who talk a lot. A true friend will listen and respect that boundary for the future.

As for the family: don’t hesitate to excuse yourself and get a drink or go to the restroom. You are not obligated to stay and be subjected to something that doesn’t interest you.

When I encounter random people who want to talk, honestly, I ignore them. It’s rude, but if you act disinterested, they usually stop. I’m not saying you should always do this, but it is a tried and true method for me. Sometimes I just point to my hearing aids and say “I can’t hear.”

Remember to respect your peace. You don’t owe anyone anything. No one else is looking out for you, so you have to look out for yourself, and that means protecting yourself however you feel is necessary.",2025-05-31 03:06:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kzn0jh/why_do_people_talk_so_dang_much/

AirPods are definitely not a suitable replacement for hearing aids. 

If you doubt your audiologist on your loss, you are more than welcome to get a second opinion.

It is clearly flawed. It took the average of those four scores and came up with 24. While that might be the correct average of those for points, the number doesn't tell the full story of your obvious huge loss in the upper frequencies.

1kyxzrj,hardofhearing,Too young to feel this old,"I was born with hearing loss, and I'm turning 40 this year. 

My hearing loss is significant, but my parents were instructed not to have me learn sign language, so I was raised in the hearing world as a hearing person. When I was younger, I had more energy to keep up on conversations in loud places and crowded settings, but this has been changing in the past few years, compounded by the fact that my hearing continues to decline. It doesn't help that the restaurant industry has trended forward industrial designs that increase the volume of noise.

I was talking about this with a coworker who also has a significant disability. It started with me saying, ""I know I'm not old, but I'm too young to feel this old,"" and she immediately affirmed what I was saying. When I say this to most people, I'm immediately met with, ""You're not old,"" and the exasperation and skepticism remain even when I explain where I'm coming from. Learning that someone else feels similarly, I wondered how prevalent this feeling is among other people. 

Every year on my birthday, as a little ""joke"" for myself, I do the math on how many pay periods I have until I retire. The number is ✨not✨ small, and it makes me laugh to see just how young I am in the grand scheme of things. This isn't me complaining about being old because of an arbitrary number; this is me feeling overwhelmed by auditory and visual stimuli to keep up with people. And it's me realizing more and more just how much more work I've always done to follow conversations. It's an entire life lived like this, and having to repeatedly explain to people what I missed and what would help me so we can have a good conversation. I didn't realize just how much I was doing until I was talking to a friend about a job posting I saw that required ""normal hearing"" (nothing in the PD would require this, so I found it odd), and she responded, ""well, with hearing aids, you have normal hearing."" I was initially angered by this until I realized that she really couldn't tell how hard it is for me, because I perfected the art of lip-reading and analyzing missed sounds at such a young age.

Of course, it's a natural part of hearing loss. It's what we do to live and thrive. But the realities still hit harder after intense days of big meetings, reading captions on virtual calls, reading lips, so on and so forth. It's not something I dwell on, but I do share my feelings when I'm in a comfortable setting with people that I think will understand me, just to realize that they can't ever truly understand me.

So, really, I think this is me trying to connect with people who have hearing loss, because that's not an opportunity I was ever presented with as I was growing up. Awhile back, I was talking to the same coworker about the occasional breakdowns that come with wishing I didn't have hearing loss, which is such a fundamental part of who I am, and how ugly it can feel. She put it perfectly when she said that we can celebrate our diversity and differences, but we should also be able to talk about grief and lament.

I'm curious if anyone else feels similar or has other insights to share. ",2025-05-30 07:16:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kyxzrj/too_young_to_feel_this_old/
1kysnc3,hardofhearing,Tinnitus and hearing aid white noise,"For any of you experiencing subjective tinnitus about to get hearing aids, ask your Oto/audiologist about it. They'll likely say what mine did ""I'll fill your head so full of sound that you can't hear it anymore."" And for the last 3 years, he was right. My hearing aids closed the gap, and it was bliss.

I'm finally giving in though now that my handy dandy anxiety has maxed out what my hearing aids used to handle no problem. (I've come to find out that emotional and mental states, blood pressure, a whole pile of things have an impact on tinnitus) I have an appointment with my audiologist to discuss and activate the white noise on my hearing aids.

It used to be that the hearing aids covered what I've always referred to as high pitched tape hiss (for those of you that remember tape hiss). Otherwise known as tinnitus. Ringing in ears is FAR too general a phrase for tinnitus, cause, it just doesn't sound like ringing. It sounds like a high pitched fizz to me. And lucky me, my right ear and left ear are almost always JUST out of phase with eachother.

My audiologist is a bit standoffish and when I asked about it at my last test, we never circled back to the topic. I finally got through about it though, it's far overwhelming my hearing aids and something needs to be done.

	•	How was your hearing afterward?

	•	Did you deal with any complications (like infections or canal narrowing)?

	•	Do you feel like it was worth it long term?

I have tried every normal way to fix it (swallowing/chewing/cupping them/rubbing/q-tips/etc) and nothing has worked. Throughout the day it got a little better until now where it flared up to an incredibly loud ringing sound. I’m not near home to go to an ent. Any help would be awesome

it’s likely from being sick and changes in barometric pressure. avoid q tips at all cost! you will fuck up your ear with them

Update, woke up in the middle of the night about 100 times, doesn’t really feel clogged anymore but the pain is absurd",2025-05-28 03:45:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kx7d96/recent_ear_clog/
1kww2i7,hardofhearing,I'm so frustrated!,"We just had an informal house meeting, me, my two housemates, and one other person. Damn if I know most of what was talked about! I tried so hard to understand them but at best I caught half. It was enough that I could smile, nod, and make general replies but I missed so much. Just when I've managed to convince myself that my hearing loss doesn't matter, something like this happens. It's so frustrating! 

I think I get my hearing aids this week. It will be nice to actually participate in conversations instead of just smiling, nodding, and hoping I don't miss anything important.

I call it “pretending to be human”. Reading other people’s reactions and responding physically in a way that seems appropriate but also dissuades people from following up with me directly. Listening and responding with physical cues but looking away when they make eye contact. It’s exhausting. 

I went the route of hearing aids and then eventually a cochlear implant. That made things a lot better. There’s no shame in sitting out the occasional conversation or social situation for your own mental health.

I’m a cochlear implant user and I struggle as well. Just wanted to let you know that I’m making a noise-filtering app where you can just have your phone under your shirt, so no one will know and youll be able to hear much better.  So far in my testing it has been super helpful for me.

You need to speak up about your hearing loss and your struggle to participate in the conversation. They either don’t know about it or don’t care. Ask one of the housemates to send you a text or an email about what was discussed. The HAs will help MASSIVELY.",2025-05-27 19:16:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kww2i7/im_so_frustrated/
1kwsxkj,hardofhearing,How can I help my grandma? Better hearing aid suggestions?,"My grandma (91F) has struggled with hearing loss for years. It’s gotten significantly worse the past few years and she has been using hearing aids from I believe Hearing of America. They don’t help her very much, they seem to make anything digital worse, for ex: talking on the phone, listening to a TV, or listening to music feel nearly impossible at times. I hate to see her live her life like this and wanted to reach out on some hearing loss threads to see if anyone has had better luck with another type of hearing aid or any suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated! Even if you have a suggestion for a better group to post in, I’ll take that too as I am new to this kind of research but desperately want to help her.

She does have caption call but struggles to use it. I did download I think the caption all app on her phone but she struggles with that as well (she doesn’t do well with new technology) as she doesn’t know how to use her iPhone very well and prefers the cordless landline. 

I heard something about AirPods helping and acting as hearing aids which I don’t have my hopes up high about for her as I image they’re for a lower grade hearing loss? Maybe they will help strictly for the digital stuff as it connects directly? 

Anything is greatly appreciated, TIA!

If you have a Costco near you they have very reasonably priced hearing aids. But you may want to bite the bullet and bring her to an audiologist.

your local center for independent living may have some ideas, reach out to them!

edit: try your local office on aging (may have a slightly different name) too!

You can have her try a ClearCast device. Easier to use than many hearing aids.

If you could sit down with her and help explain the caption call, I’m sure she would love that. You could also write instructions for her and leave them by the device. She is older, so maybe she just has a little trouble with memory recall and written words will help better?

Hearing aids don't always help us connect - I hear everything, and it's loud, but people all sound like Donald or Daisy Duck. This is not unusual, there are lots of threads on Reddit that talk about this.

But your grandma can still connect - she should use captions while watching TV. (I hope she reads fast enough). For the telephone, she can get a **free** telephone with a captions screen; see [Captel Captioned Phones](http://www.captel.com). If she has a cell phone, she can use [Live Transcribe](http://livetranscribe.app) for conversations, and [Innocaption](https://www.innocaption.com/) for cell phone calls.

Those apps may be easier than others for her to use. The Captel phone is designed for older people with a large screen and custom sized lettering, big buttons and simple interface.

If she's intimidated with technology, just be patient and show her how to use it again, and again, and use all your patience. She's not stupid, just reluctant and intimidated. But hopefully, you'll be able to show her it's all worth it.

She's very lucky to have a grandson like you - I'd like one! You're getting a perspective here from someone near her age - I'm 87.",2025-05-27 17:15:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kwsxkj/how_can_i_help_my_grandma_better_hearing_aid/
1kwmi17,hardofhearing,Questions,"Hi guys, I'm posting this because recently I noticed that at work I can no longer hear the crickets from my left ear from certain distances and I'm not sure if it's always been there and I'm just noticing it now, in  2022 I had an audiogram done and it said I had mild hearing loss in my left ear but not enough for me to benefit from hearing aids according to the doctor. 

I also suffer from tinnitus in both ears, my left ear is worse and have been dealing with eustachian tube dysfunction issues as well, primarily in my left ear I usually wake up not being able to pop my left ear in the morning as of recent, and to top it off I have mild TMJ issues, I'm sharing the results of my 2022 audiogram to see if you guys think that these results would make it more difficult for me to hear crickets from certain distances as well as high frequencies from machinery like an air conditioner.

About 7 or 8 days ago I was prescribed antibiotics because my ear was hurting and went to the doctor and said that my left ear was red since then it feels like my left ear can hear some higher frequencies again coming from the property ac which produces high frequencies sounds, however the crickets don't get picked up unless I get a bit closer, otherwise they're extremely faint.

I guess I'm very worried that I may have done additional hearing  damage to my ear but it's very hard to tell when you have eustachian tube dysfunction issues. So my question is by my 2022 audiogram would you guys say that it should be more difficult for me to hear these sounds mentioned from distances going by my audiogram?

Last but not least can you guys share with me which companies are actively researching hearing regeneration do you think we'll have something in 10 years?

[댓글]
That audiogram is definitely consistent with not being able to hear crickets as well - it shows mild high frequency hearing loss in the left ear. 

I'd also agree with the assessment that you wouldn't see a ton of benefit from hearing aids, that's an extremely minor loss on just one side. Hearing aids don't give you perfectly normal hearing, they alter sound to make it easier to understand speech for those who struggle with it.

If it feels like it's gone down, I would definitely recommend getting another audiogram done.

When I first started focusing on hearing tests and learning how much hearing loss I had…I was in my early 40s. 

I had tinnitus for years before that. I didn’t know what it would do to my hearing over time. 

I would caution you about downplaying the results. If the audiologist suggests hearing aids then please consider it. Hearing loss is correlated with cognitive decline. It also affects your safety. Hearing aids can help the tinnitus issue.

My hearing declined enough at that time they didn’t recommend me for surgical intervention. They said I wouldn’t have 100% improvement and would continue to lose hearing with age.",2025-05-27 12:53:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kwmi17/questions/

Hi! I am Hard of Hearing, also bilateral, and live in Austria as an immigrant. As far as I understand if you have health insurance here through your work, or if you study, you can get hearing aids for free through insurance. Insofar as language courses go I have had good experiences and have gotten accommodation on all my German exams which has been really helpful. Though they love paperwork here so it took quite some time the first time to get the required paperwork for it. On the other hand I am currently having a very bad experience with a couple driving school related things, as I have done my driver's licence here from scratch, where they refuse to give me any accommodation. So it may be a hit or miss honestly.

1kutm1r,hardofhearing,Help with surgical options,"My girlfriend has been legally deaf her entire life. She has some kind of genetic defect to her middle ear bones that is hereditary. Her siblings had it corrected with surgery but when they went to correct hers at 7 years old they completely deafened her on the left side. She then refused the surgery on the right side to preserve what little hearing she had left. She wears an extremely strong hearing aid to have partial hearing on one side.

I recently convinced her to talk to doctors again and see if techniques have advanced or if there are new options for her. They immediately are pushing her to get a Cochlear Implant on the 100% deaf left side after a hearing test showed some hearing in the cochlear but none in the ear. They are setting up a surgical consult for two weeks out.

I know that I pushed her to look into treatment, but this feels very rushed and I wanted to ask this community if there are other things that should be reviewed? Is there anything that we could be missing? Having hearing again on that side would be amazing but we also don't know the quality of hearing from a Cochlear Implant or what to expect from it.

Any education or advice is appreciated.

[댓글]
r/cochlearimplants exists and you can ask there. You can also just tell the docs “no thank you”. Take some time and think about it.

I just had cochlear implant surgery 5 days ago on my left side, genetic hearing loss as well. Go to r/cochlearimplants and you’ll find a lot of info there. The surgery can take a toll on her, and depending on how long its been since she heard something on that side can be a factor. To put things simply on quality: thats unpredictable, you don’t know until it’s activated if it sounds like a robot or a 2000’s ipod.

Don’t rush the decision. I haven’t had mine activated yet but here are some things I noticed/understood:

Auditory hallucinations are a thing, think of it like phantom pain when you get something amputated, but with sound. It’s creepy and hilarious at the same time.

Your balance may be off for a while, i personally think mine is because of the cochlear deformity i have (Incomplete partition type 2). If your gf has the same deformity then PLEASE get a CT scan, it can give doctors a heads up on how to do the surgery. 

It’ll be 2-3 weeks post surgery until you can get the cochlear activated.

For 24 hrs after surgery (in my case), no hearing aid on either side due to bandages, no glasses either (same reason).

The surgical site will likely itch and have a lot of pressure, not much you can do about it. 

Also- look into all 3 brands, not just Cochlear. I personally went with Advanced bionics bc it’s better with MRI’s and has colorful options, and partners with Phonak for bi-modal.

I don't know much about CI but you definitely need to research ALL of it. Not just the upsides. 

Many CI users end up hating it.

Some have serious migraines. 

Some can't get over how different CI sound is vs how hearing aids sound. Neither sound like ""normal"" hearing

There is a possibility that the surgery will eliminate any residual sound left. She most likely won't be able to go back to a hearing aid if she hates it. 

There are some medical things to be aware of. No heavy contact sports like soccer.

If you ever need an MRI you can have it done but not like everyone else (I don't know much about it) 

Check out adventuresindeafed on Instagram for more details. She's a deaf person who has CI who grew up with hearing aids and is a deaf education teacher. 

Does your girlfriend know any ASL? she'll be spending about 2 weeks with no sound before they activate the CI, not to mention if she hates it, there's no going back to hearing aids. 

It'll be a whole learning curve to decipher sound again into understanding sound. 

And of course there's always the possibility that it'll be absolutely fine and she'll love it and wish she did it sooner. But just research it ALL before taking the leap. There's no rush.

Were prosthetic bones discussed as an option at all? Do you know what bone(s) was damaged?

Can they recover any hearing on her left side? As in another surgery to fix it? If not, as far as I know the only way to help that is CI. 

A surgery consult may seem fast, but it doesn’t mean she is committing to surgery. This would give her more answers about the procedure and what to expect. If you can, I would go with her so she doesn’t feel pressured into scheduling a surgery date. She deserves time to think about her options or even see another doc or two. 

They usually push the surgery because they are under the assumption that you want it fixed. Make sure they know you are only going to find out information to make an informed decision, which you have not settled on yet. If they pressure you, ask why it is so important to be done so soon, and if you see or hear any red flags, leave. You have no contract or obligation to do the surgery. You are allowed to say no.

I’m slightly worried about her going to the same doc who took away her hearing in her left ear. I’m not saying he was at fault, but it wouldn’t inspire a lot of confidence in me. Maybe he informed her or her family that it was a possibility, but I know if it was me, that thought would always be lurking in the back of my mind. 

You did not rush her into treatment. You helped her start her journey to gather information, even if it leads nowhere. Knowledge is power. She deserves to know if there is a better option out there for her, but she also reserves the right to not do anything about it. I think you did the right thing. You care and you want her to have the best life possible, however that looks. She was scared and you gave her a little push, but helped hold her hand so she didn’t have to face it alone. You did everything I would want a SO to do.

I am a hearing aids user. 

Just note that when getting cis. They can't promise you what you will actually hear post everything

They have to destroy hearing in order to preserve hearing. 

Now if your gf qualifies and wants to go with it that is her freedom to choose.  

You should not push your agenda onto her choice.",2025-05-25 03:59:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kutm1r/help_with_surgical_options/
1kt5k3j,hardofhearing,"i alr posted this on an r/deaf reddit, but i'm doing it again here. please help i need advice","little background context-- I'm a teenager and I suffered an extreme TBI (Traumatic brain injury) back in November and was diagnosed with a concussion. since then, i've had two more head injuries (i play a lot of sports, sue me). after that initial TBI, i started to lose my hearing rather quickly. within the span of two weeks, my hearing went from just below normal to moderate/severe hearing loss. Even weirder thing was that it was flat hearing loss (on first audiogram). anyways, it kept progressing. my dad got me hearing aids, (BTE), which helped a lot, but its only progressed. I've had tinnitus since I was a young kid, and it also got worse. The audiologist did a whole battery of testing, which included normal tympanometry, and a just below normal ABR (right ear was slightly slower, and happened to be the worse ear). My cochlea was also fine. My biggest struggle is not only with the hearing loss, but the sudden inability to understand speech as well, *especially* in a crowded place. As a polygot, this is really bad for me. I am constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves, and to do so slower -- and it's humiliating. i'm also very musical and its ruining the piano for me. doctors (and i) originally thought APD (CAPD), auditory processing disorder, because of the inability to understand speech and differentiate sounds, but when we tried to get in on studies they wouldn't accept me because of the additional hearing loss. Then I heard about FND, and I'm in the midst of doing my own research because my doc gave up on me. both my parents are docs and they're trying their best as well. please help I don't know what to do. I learned ASL as a precaution,  and so did my fam, and its really helpful in crowds/restaraunts, but i can't live like this. at least not without answers/a fix. if anyone also has hearing loss related FND from TBI please please let me know. i'm desperate.

I don’t have any answers for you, just empathy and encouragement. It’s frustrating to have to ask people to repeat themselves. But you deserve the chance to hear and participate in conversation. Crowded places are frustrating. And, sadly, a lot of places are not designed with those of us who are HoH or d/Deaf in mind. 

I hope you remain persistent and find some answers.

You have a lot of technical things going on that are beyond my experience.  
But I can say for sure that you'll get past it, move forward and move on. Being embarrassed about not being able to hear others in noisy environments or asking for someone to repeat themselves is like being embarrassed about going to the bathroom. It's a part of your body's functions, like your hearing (or difficulties) and while your journey is still in motion, until answers are found, it's just what it is.

Also: your doctor 'gave up on you' is not a doctor you want to be seeing. I'm assuming you have a swarm of ENT/Oto/audiology/neurology and so on available to you, having a frank discussion about your plateaued journey and disappointment with the methods in use should spur them into action.  
DO NOT LET THEM GIVE UP UNTIL YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THEIR METHODS.

Hello, I don’t have much to add but the virtual support. Why exactly were you not accepted for music studies? This feels wrong.

[deleted]

I didn’t get hearing loss or anything from TBI but I had several severe ear infections when I was pretty young and lost both hearing in ears, my right is also worse for some reason — I had the issue with having to ask people “what” or “huh” a ton it kind of because I was deaf as hell, it kind of became one of my jokes throughout high school and I’d always respond with “sorry I’m deaf as fuck what did you say” and just make a joke out of it 

     I just graduated last year so I was dealing with having large crowds and shit for a while and it was overwhelming 100% I know the feeling one thing that helped me was being able to read lips to kind of fill in gaps and stuff cause I don’t hear everything perfectly with my hearing aids, I eventually would kind of get used to it, I went from 8 year old hearing aids to a new up to date with tech pair and I was hearing way too much at once and it kind of hurt my head to focus but I got used to it after a week or 2 

         My hearing when I first got it diagnosed though dropped a bit from when I got hearing loss (diagnosed) to when I actually got hearing aids and slightly after that then it leveled out and plateaued out",2025-05-22 23:47:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kt5k3j/i_alr_posted_this_on_an_rdeaf_reddit_but_im_doing/

(trying to give the OP link torpedoed my own ha!)

I had some serious imposter syndrome about mine. I mean 20+years of 'huh' and learning all the context clues was good enough right? No it was way way worse than I thought.

Nope.

I took my mom with me to pick them up. She's been on my ears journey since I was a 10 year old child and then, as a 39 year old man (me not my mom) she bawled her eyes out when I wore them for sitting and tuning.

I had zero idea that a/c made noise. 5,000 dollars for the most expensive headphones I ever bought. It seemed so ludicrous, I was doing fine... Well... Clearly I wasn't.

I missed a stoplight, on the way home with these things rammed in my ear canals... My car was too loud, everything was tinny, the radio had to be turned off. Mom was in her car  in front of me and called me. I was just sitting there, LISTENING to a leaf scrape across the cross walk in front of me, gobsmacked. No clue, none, I thought they were too dry, all this time, to make noise cause I'd never heard that sound.

By the time we traveled the few miles from the audiologist, I was like, drunk. Overstimulated, so much noise. I needed a beer. So we stopped for lunch. Fans in beer coolers, sports ball on so many TVs, I had a full conversation with a guy that would NEVER have been able to hear (defaulted to smile and nod even though I could hear him, habits.) Mom caught me.

Water bubbles and burbles when it's boiling.

\*Hearing aids on\* birds. \*Hearing aids off\* no birds. \*On, off, on, off\* text everyone in my family if there's always been birds in the big tree outside my apartment and get inundated with tearful and emphatic 'you didn't know?' from them... I pretended so well.

To those of you that maintain that hearing aids are NOT  normal hearing, but my hearing isn't normal on its best day. This is glorious. There's so much noise, so much stuff to hear, so much daydreaming and listening to do. I'm not a hopeless dreamer, not in the slightest, but sometimes, when it's too much... you know what? I have a quiet place with me, all the time, just a power button away, be immediately jealous normies. I carry my zen spot with me, and so do many others.

Retain your ability to stand in childlike wonder at the noise that you've always been missing, at the stuff you didn't know was happening around you, at the words that your mind filled in out of context. Hearing aids are awesome.

Edit: Gosh, it rambles, would anyone prefer I fix it? Cause I had to hasty retype the last half from memory after accidentally deleting it.

I’m a hearing aid user too, I will never forget wearing them for the first time. But I have to admit, finding the Deaf community was an even more powerful moment for me! Hearing aids help me hack it in the hearing world, but discovering the Deaf world was like finding home. I’m a huge believer in HH children getting all the options! Now that I have access to both worlds, it’s a privilege to have two cultures, two communities, and two voices

All of this is to say, I’m so glad you are liking your new hearing aids! And also want to assure you that you are a valid part of the community. I also have imposter syndrome from growing up using LSL, but our experiences of deafness are valid!

Walking in to church after being fitted … heard rustling leaves for the first time in decades. I had forgotten. A spiritual experience!

I'm an audiologist and I'm so glad you love your hearing aids! I am totally jealous that I don't have an expensive pair of custom earphones and the ability to shut off noise around me at the touch of a button 😁 

My favorite comment after putting hearing aids on a first time user. They had to use the bathroom, then they came back into my office: ""I could hear myself pee!"" Yes sir/ma'am, you sure can 😊

I think I'm looking forward to getting mine now. Thank you.

Well said.  I feel the same.

I'm mid 30s, had my hearing aid a month though I've been on this journey since I was 4! 🙃

I only have hearing loss in one ear, so I was aware of a lot of these little sounds, but being able to hear them more clearly was so weird. The world is so much noisier than I realised. Tbh sometimes it's a little overwhelming and it's a nice moment when I get home from work and take my hearing aid out and have some quiet 😂


For me, the big moment was when I went to a restaurant and I heard every part of the conversation happening at my table without having to ask people to repeat or just pretending I heard and trying to figure out what they said through context. Yes it's tinny, but man it's so nice to be able to properly join in conversations.

I remember feeling like hearing aids wouldn't really make much of a difference. It would be nice to hear more conversations with people, to not have to ask people to repeat as often. But the amazement I felt when I put them on and remembered that bugs existed and they made noises at dusk was indescribable. Leaves rustling, birds singing, the world was full of wonderful little sounds I had just forgotten all about. I could hear my child whisper to me, hear him laugh from across the house, hear him sing. As someone who was late deaf, I have loved finding a little community in the deaf community, but I could not live there all the time. Sound is just too close to my heart.

Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.

I tried hearing aids a few years ago, I was so over simulated with a lot of background noise like vehicles on the road, fans, wind etc. It made everything worse because I couldn't have normal conversation as I couldn't concentrate on hearing speech from other people. In the end I couldn't use hearing aids

Thanks for the post. It really helps. I'm too needing hearing aids, but man, it's hard to think I need them like I can get by without them. I wear contacts, so this just makes me go crazy thinking I need another device to live a normal life. Again, thanks for sharing.

ahh, I remember the first time I had my hearing aides in, in the audiologist office, I guess there was a tree with birds outside the window, and they made noises. I jumped out of my freaking skin and cussed, thought ""what the f*ck was that noise?????!! where the f*ck did it come from?!?!?!?!?!"". 

so many things made noises, that I have no idea made noises. like paper! paper makes noise! it can crinkle and even just like as it warps or something in the air, and when it touches onto the desks. and writing utensils can make noises too. 

I never actually got used to it, but I have sensory processing disorder, (auditory included) and get extremely overwhelmed and overstimulated. I was never able to get my brain to adjust to it. so I wear them so I can turn them on in an emergency, but i basically always have them off. sometimes I just carry them instead but leave them out.

My daughter, 11, after getting her hearing aids finally, we were walking up to the front door of her school, and she said, Mom!  I man hear myself walk!?

1ksp9vu,hardofhearing,Struggling to accept hearing aids,"I knew for a while that something was wrong with my hearing. I don't understand my housemates half the time and need subtitles to enjoy movies or TV. But I had almost convinced myself that I was just flaking out and not listening well enough. 

I saw an audiologist this week just to prove to myself that nothing is wrong. It turns out that I was wrong. I actually do have some hearing loss, enough that the audiologist recommend hearing aids. 

In that moment I said and did all the right things. I listened to her description of the hearing aids she recommended and asked a couple of questions. The order was placed. 

But now I'm struggling to accept the fact that I actually need them. ""I can hear just fine,"" I tell myself... and two minutes later I'm guessing what someone says to me or turning on the subtitles again. 

Y'all, this is really hard for me. I had convinced myself that my symptoms were an ADHD thing, that it was my brain that missed words. Nope. I physically am not hearing things.

Now the hearing aids are in at the audiologist's office and a huge part of me wants to leave them there! 

Thanks for listening. I just needed to talk all that out.

It's always hard when you have big changes that challenge your life's status quo. I hope you will find peace with wearing hearing aids and that you will find some improvement once you adjust to them. Wishing you the best!

Put your pride aside and make your life easier. Not hearing everything, asking for repititions, people getting mad because you didn't understand them the first time, etc etc. The best thing you can do for yourself is try them out. 

And you need to give them a fair shake. It took me about a month and a half to get used to the feeling of wearing mine. Now, after two years of having them, I wouldn't consider going back.

What you're feeling is totally normal. It will take some time to adjust. 

That said, hearing aids *rule*. They're like the fanciest headphones on the planet, you can stream music and phone calls to them, turn them off on the plane when a baby won't stop crying, you're basically a cyborg. I absolutely love my hearing aids, they're a part of me.

What you are feeling is normal! It’s a big change. But keep in mind that it will help you maintain a better quality of life to hear better.

I could of wrote this myself, but along with that I found out from a hearing test when I was 6 that my father infact knew its genetic and he opted not to deal with it!! I thought I was crazy for years thinking I couldn’t hear :(

Totally normal to feel that way. There is a grieving process that happens whenever we are diagnosed with something that is life-changing. You may feel denial, anger, confusion. But, eventually it will come to acceptance. I think once you get your hearing aids and you realize how much you can hear, you’ll come around to them. Just give it time. Personally I love my hearing aids and I was so excited to get them and finally hear what I was missing!

I mean... do you want to hear, or not? 

When you put em in and pick up on everything you've been missing you'll be glad you did.

I was born HOH, so getting hearing aids was wonderful for me! It will take time for you to adjust. We have your back here. Don’t leave them @ audiologists office. In time you’ll come to LOVE them! Accept &amp; learn to love your deafness!

Make sure the audiologist turns on the “acclimation” feature if it’s on your hearing aids. This will gradually turn up the volume available on your aids. My aids had a two week adjustment period for this feature.

:( i have a friend having this issue too, what he found helped somewhat was to think of it like custom designer airpods since they’re bluetooth.

I could have written this 10 years ago, noe that I'm used to wearing mine I hate going without them. Not because I can't but because it's so much harder than it has to be. 
I still miss stuff, just not as much. These days I'm trying to make myself be brave enough to start using additional support like a Roger microphone.

It took me using a pair of cheap hearing assistance things to see how much I actually needed hearing aids. It was definitely humbling. It only took a short time with my hearing aids to see that they were going to help me have a better quality of life. 

That was 15 years ago, when I was in my early 40s. Now, I couldn’t do my job without them. I’ve learned to see them as being as needed as my eyeglasses, and if I’m not ashamed of or resistant to using glasses, why be that way about my ears?

They will take time to get used to, and you might find it takes some time for your resistance to go away. It’s definitely normal. But give them a fair try and I’m betting you’ll see them as a helpful thing.

I composed a response to your post. It got so long that I'm turning it into its own post and I don't know how to link your post directly in it... I'll try, because you were the inspiration.

I’m so sorry. I hope you get used to them and they make your life easier.

It's a normal part of the process. You're losing something, some form of body functioning, a necessary part of your bodies functioning. It's normal that there is some anxiety, some struggle with that.

All I want to say is this: Losing your hearing is more than just hearing less. It's having a hard time understanding, having a hard time socialising and taking a lot of your energy. Lot of people who lose hearing and keep putting off getting aids have problems with memory. Because your brain is stimulated less and less, you can have some Alzheimer like symptoms, which don't fully go away when you get your aids (it's a cascade reaction). Be smart about using them, before you lose a part of yourself you can't get back. 

Also this: talk to people about it. About the grief that comes with the hearing loss, with having to rely on some technology. Talk to them about the fact that you cannot hear the same again (give yourself time to adjust to the hearing aids, because they might sound different than you're used to). Go back to your audiologist when they don't work the way YOU need them to work. They should help you, make them help you.

And after all that: look for the bright side (because there can be!). I can have some music on through my hearing aids, it's fun! I can put off the hearing aids when I want some silence, it's a perk like that! And also: have a little fun with yourself: you won't hear everything right now and again. I've lived with being HoH my whole life, and what I hear and what is said can be so different, it is honestly funny. Laugh! 

You're going to be fine. Give yourself some time to grieve and adjust, you will adjust to this.

This was kind of me 2 months ago before I got my hearing aid. I also have ADHD and definitely some audio processing issues. 

I've known I've had hearing loss since I was a child but doctors never offered me anything and I think I always assumed there wasn't anything they could do. Plus I think I had some internalised ableism about wearing hearing aids. I think when you grow up ND, you really take on hiding disability, so the idea of having something that made me look visibly disabled felt very anxiety inducing.  

I've worn mine for a month now though and first: the type of hearing aid I have are very discrete. No one even noticed I was wearing one. And it has really helped. It doesn't entirely mitigate the issues I have with communication because I do still have processing issues, but it has at least taken away that first barrier so conversations are much less exhausting.

I totally understand, I went through the same thing 13 years ago.
It took me a while to regularly wear my hearing aids as they do take a while to get used to.
But it's worth the effort, I wouldn't be without mine now &amp; if I can't wear them for whatever reason I feel very vulnerable.
Oh &amp; I have ADHD too, so believe me it really was the best thing I did, getting my hearing aids 🦻

I’ve had hearing aids since I was 3 and without them I can hear somewhat, mine are the ones that just fit right into your ear no tube on the outside - I’m moderate to severe hearing loss, but I had them for so long and no one really said a thing to me about them if I didn’t say anything and if people did they would just be like “oh that’s cool can you turn them off when you don’t want to listen to people” “can you sleep better” and mine are Bluetooth so I can listen to music whenever I want (was amazing in high school and in college now) etc 😂 honestly don’t know if I could live the way I do without these things they are awesome, $9000 portable headphones though 👌

This post basically describes what I'm going through. I had gone to an audiologist seeking advice but just started to panic and left. It's hard to cope with how much damage I've done listening to loud music, but keep telling myself I don't need them.

I’ve been wearing hearing aids for over 40 years. My approach and when I discuss it with others, is just really to let them know that some people wear glasses. Some people wear hearing aids and some people were both.

Hi, this is a bit late but I’m a cochlear implant user and I totally understand how you feel.

1ks9vv7,hardofhearing,Ear tube questions,"I was diagnosed with eustachian tube dysfunction and also barotrauma issues with my ears (im a pilot) and was given ear tubes today. My ears have been feeling very full and my hearing is off (everything sounds duller). How long does it usually take for everything to return back to normal? How long did it take you guys also had ear tubes to have your ears return back to normal sound and pressure?

[댓글]
I’ve had 13 tubes and also have Eustachian tube dysfunction. Up until number 13 the impact was instant post procedure - crystal clear hearing and ability to equalise. Number 13 has been a disaster with post op bleeding from the middle ear and loads of balance issues. Number 11 through 13 have been sub-annular rather than through the ear drum (it can’t take any more perforations).

Oh man going way way back to my youth when I did this twice anually till I was 17. 

Give it a couple weeks. 

You have holes in your eardrums as of today and they're pretty angry about it. This I think also changes the way your eardrum moves, so there'll be some differences.   
IF your eustachian tubes are non functional, how did you get this far in life without like 800 ear infections? Lucky dog... That's the root cause (they think) of all my hearing stuff.

So, I have tubrs that I've had for 4 years or so, and I have to get them replaced when they fall out. I have permanent dysfunction, with my tubes near completely closed. When I could hear, before I got a nasty infection needing IV therapy. It took about a week. Try the Vasulva maneuver.

[댓글]
I know this app well, it's amazing with a proper over the ear headphones. Get something good like Sony xm4 and above and it will work great. You also need to turn off all equalizer and anc. 

The problem is as you can see on the below right, you skipped the calibration.


With proper calibration (for most of the good headphones, it's automatic) it's almost as good as a professional audiogram.

I would suggest seeing an audiologist.  But if you won't/ can't, I would say to at least use the same headphones otherwise you're comparing apples and bananas.

Mobile apps are not a replacement for a trained audiologist exam.

For the love of god, go to a trained specialist for objective, professional and proper medical advisement. This is your health we’re talking about hear.

What is this app? I'd love to compare it to my most recent audiogram.

I'm sure you would have noticed if your hearing went from almost deaf to mild loss. However, if you're concerned about your hearing, I would just go see a specialist. 

I don't know if apps are any good, but I can imagine it's not going to be as good as professional tests.

Different headphones definitely vary a lot in frequency response. The professional headphones are probably properly calibrated to the specific software they're using",2025-05-21 19:43:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ks73fm/hearing_seems_to_be_improving/
1ks3c20,hardofhearing,Hearing Aid Financial Assistance,"Hello everyone,

I recently earned my Doctor of Pharmacy degree and will be starting my residency program very soon. Unfortunately, due to my own carelessness, my dog chewed up my left hearing aid. I’m now left with only the right one, which is making it very difficult to function, especially as I prepare to start work in a clinical setting where clear communication is essential for patient safety.

I’ve looked into financial assistance options in both my home state and the state where I attended pharmacy school (where I currently live), but I’m either ineligible or facing long wait times, sometimes 3 to 6 months. I’m also still considered a dependent and currently have very little income, making it impossible for me to afford a replacement out of pocket. And for those wondering my insurance deductible is $5,000 making it virtually impossible to get coverage as I’m not anywhere close. 

I would really appreciate any guidance or resources, nonprofits, grants, hearing aid, or other avenues that could help me obtain a new hearing aid quickly. Any advice would mean a lot to me.

Thank you so much in advance.

Check with your local Vocational Rehab and see if you qualify for assistance

Depending on the brand and model of aid you need, you can try purchasing a new one through an online hearing aid retailer such as: 

- https://onlinehearing.com/
- https://www.wholesalehearingdirect.com/
- https://fithearing.com/product-category/discount-hearing-aids/
- https://www.ziphearing.com/

Or, I have also heard that Costco has very reasonable prices.

Have you checked with vocational rehab in your state? My state pays for hearing aids and college but need to ask.

First I would check to see if there is any free replacement program availible, the last pair I bought had free replacement for like 5 years as long as you had the device, no matter the condition. If not for new ones, it can depend on a number of factors including where you live you and household income but you may be eligible for financial assistance from the hospital you get your hearing aids from, this could be in the form of writing off the debt or giving you a payment plan on it. Even if household income is high, explain your situation and they still might help. Personally I would get the new hearing aids and then deal with the bill when it comes. Often hospitals are more willing to work with people after they owe them money...

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this right before residency starts. My FIL has moderate hearing loss and wears over-the-counter hearing aids (he's been using Audien Ion Pro) and has had a good experience with them. They're much more budget-friendly and might help hold you over while you sort out a more permanent solution.

My audiologist office accepts donations from patients. Have you checked with your audiologist to see if they have anything to bridge the gap?

one avenue that might provide a quick, temporary solution, or at least help you function while you pursue long-term financial assistance, could be exploring some of the newer (OTC) hearing aids. They aren't prescription devices, but some models like [this one](https://rewarduplevel.com/aff_c?offer_id=1904&amp;aff_id=129838)are specifically designed for mild to moderate hearing loss and can be purchased much faster and often for under a few hundred dollars. They might not be the permanent, high-end solution you'll eventually need, but they could bridge the gap.

I would look into vocational rehabilitation.

Also, note for the future- get your hearing aids insured. I worked for a property and casualty insurance company and a coworker was gobsmacked that I didn’t insure mine. She said this is incredibly common. Just add it to your home insurance or renters insurance.

Medicare/aid may help pay for hearing aids",2025-05-21 17:13:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ks3c20/hearing_aid_financial_assistance/
1kr9ohp,hardofhearing,Apple Watch detects 85-90db purely due to people talking. Is that dangerous?,"Hey guys so I thought it was clubs or bars with loud music where hearing levels can be damaging but recently looking at my Apple Watch see that even tons of people chatting at once can go over 85-90db. I'm now worried as after club exposure and getting tinnitus I now protect my hearing but haven't in crowded settings either. I don't have any hearing loss according to a professional hearing test back in August thankfully but I just want to make sure I know I'm being careful in the future.

[댓글]
Yeah, but only if you spend more than 40 hours a week according to Apple health

My hearing loss starts at that range and gets worse. What’s funny, I didn’t realize it until it got worse that I’ll never get it back to the levels it was before. 

So don’t do more unknown damage to yourself only to find out later. Not worth it.

I’ve noticed if I have my hand near my face when talking(like resting my head in my hand while leaning on a table) I’ll always get alerted if I talk enough. Does that mean that me talking at a normal volume is going to damage my hearing? 

Most likely not. 

There’s a lot of factors that play into how loud sound is. Normal talking isn’t going to hurt you. If you’re worried about loud environments I’ve heard a ton of people like products like Loops.

I once had mine go off from a Starbucks Drive through intercom. I was in a mood, was annoyed by the alert, turned it off. 

As others have said, its a sustained exposure that really leads to hearing loss. However, far as I know, there's no time frame setting on the alert, just db level, so you have to use your own judgment on how long you want to be in that environment.",2025-05-20 16:45:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kr9ohp/apple_watch_detects_8590db_purely_due_to_people/
1kr2rkb,hardofhearing,Dealing with On-Call Stuff,"Hi everyone,

I'm hard of hearing with a moderate to severe hearing loss. I ended up in the computer security (i.e. cyber) industry, and it turns out that a lot of it is IT with some additional security layer-ons. I've been told in my interviews that I need to get some more administrative experience in order to really be good in this field.

It turns out that being an administrator is basically being the parent of a baby: i.e. when something goes wrong, you must attend to them. Larger enterprises have people available through rotational shift-on-call schedules, but sometimes there might be an expectation or a need for me in a job to be on-call at night.

I've been looking at some technological solutions and options, but I'm afraid that even with the strongest measures taken, they might not be enough/suitable to wake me up in the middle of the night when something is going on. Have you all ever navigated something like this, and if so, what did you do to successfully get through such a life obstacle?

[댓글]
You can get a flashing light system, or bed shaking system to wake you up. In Canada the Hearing society sells adaptive technology to help

If you’re not a super-deep sleeper, a smartwatch or wearing your phone on one of those exercise arm band thingies, I did it for several years and the vibration was enough to wake me to some level of awareness. 

I also leaned heavily on outsourcing. You don’t need someone as qualified as you working that second/third shift and weekends, you just need someone who can follow a simple set of rules to determine “is this something I need to wake up u/SnooOnions3761 about” (and if so, keep calling/texting me till my old ass wakes up)

I make on-call expensive and undesirable for any company. Unless I’m getting paid a 24/7 salary (spoiler: nope) I make a compelling case that NOT outsourcing is untenable.

I sleep with my phone under me so I can feel it vibrate. I also have a watch linked as well and am also a heavy sleeper. Configuring alerts inside the alerting platform to hit me on the app, then SMS, then email al within 2-3 minutes. (Work paid for watch)

You mentioned you were a deep sleeper, but how responsive are you to lights?
I am a deep sleeper in regards to noise, but lights I often wake up easily to.
While I am not on call, I use an automation via smart light bulbs to turn on when a certain alarm on my phone turns on.
Shortcuts or IFTTT may be a great method to play around with. I’m not skilled enough to make it pair with a vibration of any sort, but I wish I could! I wonder if there are any that do connect via Bluetooth and if there would be a way to play with those settings?

I’m not a particularly deep sleeper but I’m concerned I’d sleep through the smoke alarm if I’m home alone. Fire Service (Scotland) coming out to visit next week to assess. If you’re such a deep sleeper, how will the smoke alarm waken you?",2025-05-20 11:43:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kr2rkb/dealing_with_oncall_stuff/
1kqns1v,hardofhearing,Looking for Bone conduction hearing aid (after failed stapedectomy),"My story:

  
Had a firework go off next to my ear. Saw a local ENT who performed a tympanoplasty, but while in there, saw the stapies was blown to bits. Woke up from surgery, had 2 months of insane 9/10 vertigo that rendered life terrible. 3 months later had stapedectomy, had 1 week of hearing, but scar tissue slowly built up, and hearing went away. Then had another (or maybe it was just a ""revision"", with similar results). That was 10 years ago. I gave up trying because the emotional uncertainty was too hard. Some odd side effects, if i touch my tongue to the roof of my mouth, its makes my eardrum tickle. I also have constant tinnitus. Maybe once every year, I have a multi day bough of vertigo, but luckily it usually clears up. 

Fast forward 15 years, I have a 3 year old son, and I think I would like some solution to provide hearing, as my inner ear still works (if I put my teeth on the guitar body I can hear it quite well) and bone conduction hearing aids could be a solution. In fact I even had the sound-bite device for a while, before it broke and they had gone out of business.   
  
Anyone have an experience either Pronto or BAHA? Or any others I should consider? Any complications with the process of putting a bolt in your skull? Any new developments? Its been so long since I have seen an ENT, not sure where to start. Thanks for any info you can provide. 

[댓글]
Also, I have no current hearing in the damaged ear. I work in a woodworking shop and dont always wear ear protection becuase i thought the ear is already damaged, Maybe I should start

I had a BAHA for about 6 years. I upgraded once to the 6 max hoping it would be better. Nope. The implant site is still sometimes sore and gets crusty if I accidentally brush my hair the wrong way. My bike helmet makes my sunglasses rub on the area and irritates the abutment site. I didn’t feel I got much out of it. I just had ossicular reconstruction with tympanoplasty with a very skilled surgeon. I drove an hour and a half to have a surgeon who knew what he was doing. My surgery ended up complicated. My eardrum had grown onto my stapes and to the chorda nerve. My incus was gone. I have no taste or feeling in 2/3 of my tongue but hopefully it will recover. This is the surgery I should have had 6 years ago but my Kaiser doctor said it wouldn’t work and to do the BAHA   Ends up she didn’t know how and I should have gotten a second opinion. My hearing is a little bit better and might improve even more in the next couple months. My clicking and fluttering in that ear has gone away. If all goes well I will be removing my BAHA Do your research and get second and third opinion

The BAHA implant is in my skull and the abutment is screwed into the implant. The skin surrounding the abutment some what attaches to it. However it can easily pull away or just get irritated. So it is like a scab forms when it gets bothered. My son kept recommending that I get it removed because he said it is basically a wound that is always there trying to heal. My son is a neurosurgeon. Two years after I got the BAHA I was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease in my other ear , just bad luck. That diagnosis motivated me to seek out help for saving some hearing. Wearing hats and helmets is tricky.

I'm about to get a stapedectomy. Hopefully it goes well, but, on the off chance it doesn't, my doctor has already told me she recommends a cochlear implant. 


I had a BAHA for years. The external part attached to my head via a magnet. It worked okay. Sound conducted better with stronger magnets, but the extra pressure gave me very bad headaches, so I eventually stopped wearing it. The doctor who's performing my stapedectomy removed the implant last year.

I have conductive hearing loss, tried the stapedectomy, but during surgery my Dr found an artery (persistent stapedial artery) in my middle ear, he closed up and couldn't do the stapes surgery, so I understand your frustration and emotional uncertainty.

I saw another doctor after and recommended a baha implant, we went with the Oticon Ponto 5 implant, there's a ton of videos and information online about it, but here are my two cents: it works well and unless I hit the sound processor by accident it doesn't fall off. I have dropped the sound processor a few times and it hasn't broke or gotten damaged. It is a solid option for me, sounds like for you it would be too.

Some drawbacks are, while the abutment heals you do need to keep the (minimal) wound clean, and after, you need to clean it once a week (very easy to do). Of course I can't hear anything with my right ear when I don't have it on, which is very irritating so you have to keep batteries available wherever you go (depending on usage, batteries can last anywhere between 5 and 7 days).

On the positives... I can hear!!, I can listen to music, answer all my phone calls and listen to anything on my phone through bluetooth, BUT BETTER YET I CAN'T HEAR MY HUSBAND SNORING WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING (let's just call it selective hearing) :D

That said, I would do anything to get my hearing back, but unfortunately my weird Persistent stapedial artery makes surgery complicated for me.

Though I'm sorry about your hearing loss, I hope this is helpful. Feel free to dm me if you have any questions.",2025-05-19 21:28:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kqns1v/looking_for_bone_conduction_hearing_aid_after/
1kqebh1,hardofhearing,Losing Confidence Because of My Hearing,"I'm 33 years old and from Japan. I have some trouble with my ears, and this is my first time posting on Reddit.

It was last year when I first felt discomfort in my right ear, so I went to a clinic to get my hearing checked. The doctor told me that while I didn’t need any urgent treatment, my hearing wasn’t very good compared to others my age. I had never experienced tinnitus before the diagnosis, but it started around that time.

Since then, I’ve been constantly worried about my ears.

Now I’m dealing with tinnitus and trouble hearing clearly. But every doctor I’ve seen says there’s no problem. Still, I constantly hear the ringing, and sounds don’t seem clear to me.

The doctor acknowledged that I have some high-frequency hearing loss, but they said it shouldn’t affect my ability to hear in daily life.
So I’m confused — if that’s the case, why am I having trouble hearing clearly? What’s really going on, and who’s right?

[댓글]
Your hearing is considered in normal range (barely) your issue is tinnitus 

Protect your hearing as much as possible to prevent your tinnitus and 8khz hearing from getting worse

You have a mild loss just on the edge of ""totally normal"" thresholds. You will notice some difficulty with high frequency sounds, but things like bird songs and rustling leaves... It's not yet really affecting human speech, though perhaps you'd notice it a bit in noisy environments.

See your third cross and circle? Mines a sharp ski slope down from there (I don't mean that like it's a competition lol, just sharing to help frame it) and so my loss goes from mild to moderate to severe to profound. I also have severe tinnitus all the time.

I've heard but not verified that under stress, tension, anxiety; hearing is the first thing to 'go'. Meaning, that when you're all tense cause you didn't hear something, you're making it worse for yourself. You're gonna miss some things, and that tinnitus isn't helping.

Take a deep breath, focus yourself. You'll find you have an amazing ability to fill in with context, and don't be above asking someone to repeat themselves. In the meantime, at night, or in quiet time, white noise machine or just some background drivel on your phone will help the tinnitus from creeping into the forefront of your brain.

You COULD ask for (I can't tell if the Dr did one on your audiogram) a speech in noise (SIN) test, that might lend to sensorineural hearing loss, which might explain some things. Did they really only do one masked test at the 1000 Hz? 

Strictly off the gram, speech \*shouldn't\* be a problem for you, a typical Japanese Female speaks at 220-260 hz and you're theoretically normal at that range. Tinnitus, perhaps some further digging is needed, for now work on your calm.

1kq8clj,hardofhearing,Affordable hearing aids?,"Are there any hearing aids under $200 that help with mild to moderate hearing loss?

[댓글]
Anything under $200 isn't a hearing aid, it's just a sound amplifier.

That said, your best bet at that price point is probably Apple Airpods, they have an amplification feature I know some have found value in.

Next step up would be Over-the-Counter hearing aids, then Costco brand above that.

I have mild hearing loss with tinnitus and I'm using Audien Atom Pro 2. It's only $189 if you buy from the official site and use their voucher. Obviously not a miracle device but it's simple and reliable. For the price, it's hard to beat.

I’m been using ELEHEAR hearing aids for over a month and they are great. $411, easy instructions and good streaming and iPhone connection. 45 day try out comes with them.

your not going to find anything your.headphones can't do at that price point. hearing aids are fucking expensive, especially the good ones, look to see if there's any financial aid programs for hearing aids and see what can help

Costco is the best price/service I have ever found.  Check your Province (Can) or state , they ma have financial support.  In Ontario Canada you get $500.00 …which almost covers all of your hearing aid at Costco.

Closest option might be Apple AirPods with your audiogram programmed to them and if you are within approved regions. What country are you in? There are programs available and options for affording hearing aids. If you are in the US and are working or a student, some states will pay for hearing aids through their vocational rehab office. My state offers hearing aids and college tuition for deaf/hard of hearing residents that want to work or pursue higher education. Vocational rehab does not offer services for anyone under 18 in my state.

My partner uses OTC hearing aids from audien. He started with the atom pro 2 (under $200) and later upgraded to the ion pro (about $600) mainly for the bluetooth feature. Both worked well for him and he's been happy with the sound quality. If you're watching your budget, the atom pro 2 is a good entry point. But if you can spend a bit more, the ion pro is worth considering.

I've been using the Nova hearing aid from Heardirectclub for my moderate hearing loss. It's about 259$, a bit above your budget, but it is worth the price. There's a noticeable difference when you have them on, voices sound much clearer. You can even get a feel for the improvement through the audio simulation on their website.

Since the issue is a nerve deficiency, I'm unable to get a cochlear implant, and I'm left with no way to localize sound. I can hear what people are saying fine unless it's loud, so I usually go unassisted. I've tried cros and bone conduction implants, but what I've found most helpful are AirPod Pros of all things due to their conversation boost mode.

Honestly, the most annoying part is the inability to tell where sound is coming from. My hearing is literally mono. People, even family, will yell to get my attention and I have to look for visual cues. I bump into people often because I don't know that they're coming up behind me. 

I always have this feeling people don't believe me because I converse unassisted and it sucks. Assistance doesn't help the core issue for me, which with current technology is unfixable. It's only helpful in certain contexts, so I'm left in this weird space where I appear conventionally hearing, but the issues are real and they're just... not curable for me.

I'm curious if there are any other profound SSD people here. I feel like I'm in a weird place when it comes to deafness sometimes, lol.

Yea it sucks.  I'm ssd for 1.5y now from covid.  Still adjusting.  I mostly just stay on the edge of social gatherings now.  Have to be very strategic in where I position myself.  I got a disability tattoo on my deaf ear. 

  
Do you experience tinnitus?

Hey! I've been profoundly deaf on my left side my whole life. Lost the nerve to meningitis, so I'm completely mono as well. I found it extremely isolating because I'm not hearing enough to function like abled people, but not deaf enough to be part of the community.

The way people don't believe I'm disabled is crazy. The struggle to have conversations in public settings or in groups larger than 3 is so real.

I also tried cros hearing aids, but they were super uncomfortable and just made sound overwhelming.

You say you've tried bone anchored hearing aids? I've been wanting to get something like the BAHA for so long. Are they worth it, do you think?

Huh 

TIL I wouldn't be able to get a cochlear implant even if I wanted to since my hearing loss is very similar to yours.

I lost all hearing (no nerve response at all) in my left ear several months ago due to Labyrinthitis, but the hearing in my right ear is near-perfect. I also have moderate tinnitus (whooshing mostly) in my deaf ear, which is really distracting (and can contribute to auditory fatigue by the end of the day). I've been putting off the hearing aid discussion/decision while I dealt w/ other issues, but now it's time. I work mostly solo in a quiet setting, and my meetings are nearly all virtual, so I don't typically need any assistance there. Restaurants and larger in-person meetings are difficult, though, and I attend (and present at) conferences at least once/year, which is very challenging now. I'm also frustrated about my inability to identify or localize sounds unless I have visual of the cause or event (i.e., Was that a cat throwing up in the other room? A tree branch scraping a window? Something falling inside a closet?) I've looked into all the options (traditional HAs, BAHA, CROS, Cochlear Implant); any advise or insight re: best outcomes for those high-ambient-noise environments? Any technology that can help with localization of sounds?",2025-05-19 10:21:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kq87c6/just_found_this_wondering_if_there_are_any_other/

Just in advance, I have not nor am I a candidate for this. BUT.

When Dr. Otolaryngologist said that he was going to do it during the repair to get my brain out of my ear, I did some research. Came to find out after the brain part of the surgery that he didn't do it while he was in my ear, BUT still was gunning to go back in and do it after the brain part of the healing.  
There's a fraction of people who come out of tympanoplasty worse off than they were before. I don't remember what fraction, but it's a possibility. This is ABSOLUTELY something I'd ask Dr. Ear about as soon as you can.

Just a question, because this is the exact outcome (after original Dr. Otolarygologist got fired from my healthcare network for things like this) that my newer Dr. said would be if I had it done.  
Do your eustacian tubes work properly? Cause that might be a bit of a red flag for this surgery.

I haven’t been the on-call person in a few years, but I used to put my phone in one of those armband things and wear it on my wrist. The vibration was enough to rouse me, but I’m a fairly light sleeper.

I'm lucky enough with my phone close at full volume that it does the job 95% of the time. When I was in a position where my phone might ring, I just made it abundantly clear that the first or second call might be missed, and to keep trying.

I use a Vibio portable alarm clock. It connects to your phone and vibrates with texts and calls.

Does the sonic boom not work for you? I don’t use the volume portion, but the part where it shakes the bed. Even when I used to sleep like death, it still woke me up. I think there are ones that even let you plug your lamp into it so the light will flash to wake you up.

Would that child be better off as part of the Deaf community, or the hearing community? 

I’m interested to know how much has changed since I was born, and how much the lack of knowledge and awareness has impacted my life (or not). 

Thank you!

[댓글]
I was mainstreamed. I have a profound loss. 

Get involved with the Deaf community ASAP. Learn ASL. Teach the kid ASL. You can’t really teach lip reading. Take this kid to Deaf events. Get them involved with Deaf culture NOW. 

I am 42 now and I don’t feel like I’m part of the hearing world, but I also feel ashamed when I try to do things with deaf world because I don’t know ASL. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere and I wish to God my parents had gotten involved with the deaf community.

I was both in the deaf and hearing community my parents made sure to send me to summer school where im surrounded by deaf and hoh communities and theres also some camp that has something similar I'm not sure if you're from California but we have this camp called Painted Turtle. I'm not exactly fluent in ASL however I am learning its still a wonderful thing to learn

Our son has mild to moderate loss post meningitis. He was fitted for hearing aids in both ears, we are doing speech therapy AND are teaching him ASL. We will be providing him access to both ""mainstream"" and Deaf culture. He will always straddle both worlds, and we want him to feel familiar with them and have options down the road for what what feels the most like home.

As someone who boarders on needing hearing aids that was forced to learn to lip read: please don’t do that to your child. Nothing was more humiliating to me than needing to learn a skill *that isn’t even that helpful* because my parents pushed it. It also makes *a lot* of hearing people uncomfortable when you’re staring at their lips instead of the rest of their face from personal experience, it takes awhile for people to feel comfortable enough to complain but they inevitably will. Please don’t have your child develop a skill that they will constantly get complaints about later. 

If they one day need hearing aids or ASL get it done but don’t push it farther into those ends than they need to be pushed. Your audiologist should be consulted on all of their needs (that aren’t lip reading).

I also have a child who is HoH and yes! LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE!!! Asking Deaf people to lip read is actually kind of rude. A child who has any loss but can still hear is a part of BOTH worlds. Find local Deaf gatherings - Deaf people typically embrace those wanting to learn their language, but especially love parents doing it for their kid.

I can’t exactly tell you what an audiologist would say, but from someone who was a HOH child I would teach them sign. It’s something I wish I was taught. I also think it’s valuable to surround them with other HOH kids. I didn’t know anyone who was and I grew up very ashamed of my disability. Try to surround them with people who understand what they are going through. Also, don’t force your child to wear the hearing aids if they don’t want to. I never wanted to and it was forced on me for years of my life. I found them very uncomfortable, the sound was robotic, and it hurt because my mom would shove them in my ears. I was only allowed to not wear them when my parents found out I hadn’t been wearing them to school in years.

Hello! I am in the US. My child did not pass their newborn hearing test (a test now given to all babies on day 1 or 2 at the hospital). We found out around month 3 with a follow up ABR test that they have mild high frequency hearing loss. The advice we were given, and are following, was to fit them with hearing aids and enroll them in early intervention. 

They have been wearing hearing aids since they were 6 month old and started early intervention around month 5. As part of early intervention, they have speech therapy every other week and physical therapy once a month.

We have also opted into a sign language class through EI — however, the class is 1xweek at 7 PM which conflicts with bedtime routine. We do want to have a basic understanding of ASL and teach our child basic ASL but current focus is hearing aids / early intervention.

As part of diagnosis, we’re were also advised to get generic testing, rule out CMV, do a MRI and have their heart and kidneys checked out to find out “why” and to rule out any further complications!

We have since connected with another family who have 2 children with mild to moderate hearing loss and they are following the same guidelines as us!

No. If you are American, contact your school district and start early intervention. 

Get your child started with auditory therapy asap.

Your child is not deaf. With modern aids, they should have access to all speech sounds.",2025-05-18 22:08:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kpvve8/child_with_hearing_loss/

1ko9mse,hardofhearing,Captioning Glasses,"I've already posted before but would love to hear from you guys about Captioning Glasses.

I am looking into purchasing a pair, since using my phone to close caption during group events is extremely hard and confusing since I keep looking up and down up and down from my phone to the lips of the person talking.

Does anyone here have any experience with captioning glasses and which brand would you recommend? Would love to hear your experience and what model you're using/interested in.

Currently there are many brands popping up using AI to caption. I've already tested XRAI but it was either not transcribing well or completely losing connection with the captioning app on the phone and it required using a combination of glasses connected to phone.

Through my researched the top three for me at the moment are Xander, Hearview and Captify, I know Ray Ban also have captioning glasses but they're collaborating with Meta and I dislike Meta and I feel like Ray Ban are more about style over substance.

I do use hearing aid in addition to captioning app and lip reading but would love additional accessibility options.

Would like to hear your thoughts.

[댓글]
Hearview is a scammy company. They markup the glasses too much and several Deaf influencers have publicly called them out. 

All the glasses on the market rely on an internet connection and phone. They only work as good as a phone based caption app does in any given environment.

Waiting for my xrai glasses to arrive. Will post a review when it does. Will probably post it end of november

I have a pre order with captify. They have onboard mics but still need a phone connection for processing.  Xander also looked good but out of my budget Xander doesn’t need a phone

Use live transcribe? The glasses are just expensive AI that already exists with live transcribe for free or if you use apple otter ai (dunno if you have to pay but it's definitely cheaper than the glasses)

I have the Even Realities GB and use the AugmentOS app for transcription. It's new technology with growing pains but quickly developing. The AugmentOS devs have been wonderfully responsive and release updates often. The Even app needs work but the hardware itself is pretty solid. Glasses mics aren't great but now both apps allow you to use phone mics which catches a lot more and opens up the option for setting up an external mic.

I like them and use them every day but it's not at the point where I can completely rely on them. Similar to hearing aids they struggle in loud environments with multiple speakers, and the battery for the glasses is ~4hours of active transcription. Still, they look beautiful, function better with every update, and it's another tool for me to communicate even if it's not perfect (yet). All in all a technology I'm happy to support.

The state bought my HA’s, doubt they would fork over $$ for caption glasses. But I would like to try on a pair!

I recently was having a more hard time the last 5-6 years and finally went to have it tested!

(I don’t communicate with my parents, as I had a very tumultuous child hood, there was a hunch of home recommendations and check ups  said to be done - but nothing ever was!) 

Anyone else have high frequency GENETIC hearing loss? I guess this type is typically indicative of noise exposure but I have mutated gjb2 gene and possibly others! 

[댓글]
Yes; my grandmother started losing her hearing in high school, and was profoundly deaf by the time she was 30. With hearing aids, she was able to lead a nearly-normal life.

not high frequency, but certainly genetic. 

I knew my paternal grandmother was profoundly deaf, and my dad got his first hearing aids in his early 40s, and that was when I realized (17 yo) I had tinnitus that wasn't going away, and couldn't hear like a cat anymore. fast forward, I was fully prepared to get fitted with hearing aids in my early 40s, right on schedule.(I probably could have benefited a few years earlier.) my dad got a CI when he was about 70, as did his oldest brother, probably around the same age. a couple of my cousins have expressed similar struggles. my hearing is continuing to decline, so I know where I'm headed.

yes, genetics can suck, but at least I was prepared, and with a good role model!

edit to add: I've never been tested for genes related to hearing, but I have for other unrelated things. the hereditary hearing loss was pretty darn obvious, though.

It’s believed mine is genetic (think an ent would need to confirm that) but it’s not high frequency

Not as directly but the disease that causes my hearing loss, which is 100% genetic but my specific gene isn't yet identified, we found out over 30 years later.  I was a 1980s baby and my disease was barely understood. A few very specific variants had been described but were mysterious. The breakthroughs with the first identified genes and starting to recognize these bizarre immune phenomenon didn't happen until the mid to late 1990s. It's a pediatric onset disease so focus is there and like many kids mine tempered a good bit in my teens. 

Then after an unrelated medical thing that involved a lot of hormonal treatments it woke back up. 

I remember when I was diagnosed my life finally making sense for me and my family. And as we continued to learn about it it continued to be absolutely mind bending. Similarly the clues were there but in my case there was no way to put them together at the time. Weirdly it's in large part thanks to how severely it impacted my inner ears and my abdomen that I was diagnosed, since still the focus is on pediatrics. Which is the right thing, ideally very few people with this disease make it through childhood undiagnosed. 

My complications were just ironically loud enough that it pushed the doctors to keep digging.

Point being I get the head trip and be prepared for it to keep coming. It's a lot, and new revelations and pieces will fall into place for sure.

ETA I have what's called Systemic Autoinflammatory Disease, also known as periodic fever syndrome. It causes something that's a bit of a mix of Menires and autoimmune inner ear disease for me. Inflammation of my inner ear and structures around it. Thankfully when it's at a point it's doing permanent damage I am very obviously ill. So even though we didn't even have a clue I had systemic disease until years later I was able to get it under control with steroid injections so the permanent damage isn't as bad as it could have been.

Yep, born with it and now 34. Mines more like a curvy ski slope from left to right. Starts sooner than yours, much steeper, and doesnt come back up again. Its also degenerative/progressive.

My sister has the same loss. 

So hi there, from the worlds inbetween.

We don't know specifically what gene variant causes it, but the high frequency hearing loss in my family is considered to be genetic by our doctors. My audiogram looks nearly identical to my dad's and my oldest child's, and we all had mild loss as small children that progressed to moderate during puberty. My youngest has mild loss now, we'll see if they follow the pattern in the next four or five years!

My dip was at 2 kHz specifically. Not sure why or how. Unrelated to it I got deaf on the right side. Left is now taken care of with a hearing aid. Before going deaf on the right side, I struggled for as long as I can remember differentiating between specific words. It’s much better now with a hearing aid.

Ironically, I do not have this dip anymore on my implanted side so I guess my doctor back then might have been correct that it had something to do with tension on the eardrum.

Yes, my oldest sister and I (I am the youngest of 5) have the same hearing loss! My oldest sister started losing here hearing at about 7-8 years old and then I started losing mine at 13-14 years old. So crazy to hear someone else with this too! 

Same form of loss, however, since my sister had hers longer, she is now legally deaf and barely has any hearing left. Whereas I still have some normal range, however, I am legally deaf in the high frequencies. 

The progression of my hearing loss is much less severe than hers, but my hearing level goes down about 5-10 dB every year. Only my 250hz-500hz is at moderate loss around 40. After that, it falls sharply down to 110 or lower for my hearing level between 750-8000hz

Hey you and I are a lot alike! Which is rare like you said. I haven’t found many with our type. I also have high frequency genetic hearing loss that wasn’t age/sound exposure related. I don’t know if I have a mutated gene or not. Never looked into that. I was diagnosed at age 5 about 39 years ago and called it my old lady hearing when I was a kid because of how it was explained to me. 

Luckily, or unluckily, I am also autistic and ADHD. That means I focused on lip reading (still do this), made people force me to pay attention to what they said, made people slow down, etc and all of my attention issues growing up were blamed on my hearing loss. I had front row seats in school. I didn’t get the ADHD and autism diagnosed until my late 30s. I may have audio processing issues too but it’s impossible to untangle from my specific hearing loss so no one wants to bother. I don’t either. 

I don’t need hearing aids yet but I am not too far away from that potential reality. I haven’t had much in the way of medical intervention where my hearing is concerned though. I seemed fine, found work a rounds, so that’s what everyone went with.

I have genetic high frequency hearing loss, Or well beleive its genetic, I don't think I was tested on the gene side of things, but, I did fail all my hearing tests when I was a newborn. Normal hearing up till I get to the higher ranges where it dips down to mild to moderate loss, been at that level for all my life.

We do need to give my nieces and nephews a much more expansive  test as newborns because of my hearing loss. I guess if one of them fails, then we know it's likely genetic. Otherwise, I assume it is because we do have other family members with similar-ish hearing issues.

my brother and I both have high frequency hearing loss so I assume it is genetic.

That is what I have. Genetic. Didn't find out till I was 22.",2025-05-16 19:21:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ko9e82/found_out_i_found_out_27_years_ago/

No personal experience, no, but I did consider getting something about fifteen years ago, so the tech might not even be available anymore. 

Basically, back then there were few, if any, video monitors. Social Services (UK) offered me an alert system could include up to four devices: doorbell (no Ring back then), landline telephone (still more common than mobiles), fire alarm, and baby monitor. During the day I’d wear a vibrating pager, but at night a device under my pillow would shake to wake me. 

Nowadays, there might be something connected to phone apps, idk. There is a company called Bellman &amp; Symfon that still make the devices mentioned above, idk if they’re international. Deaf charities might also sell products too?

All I want, and it’s not hard to do, is to see the word fuck on captions instead of underscores.

Honestly? The only real way to ensure that closed captions are accurate is to have a team of human beings doing the transcription.  You can absofuckinglutely tell who uses auto-gen and who uses real people.

I filled out the survey but I have to ask—are you hard of hearing and do you have experience watching contents with captions?

suggestions I added:

1. Why are hearing impaired viewers discriminated against by censoring possible offensive language when it is fully audible? eg. YouTube leaves out perceived expletives altogether in auto captions. 

2. Can video and audio be delayed to match live captioning on things like news reports? It can be very difficult to follow if you're relying on a combination of audio, lip reading, and captions when the captions are several seconds behind. Can video delay be an option?

I would go crazy and give up if a movie had captions appearing all over the screen. And the one with animations just scrambled my brain.

It's always bothered me, like enormously that I can't hear it like it's supposed to because, well, most onboard EQ software (JBL quantuum engine, lookin at you) are kinda crap and adjustments don't feel right. I spent good money on these sound devices, and I want them to make sense for ME with minimal work.

Here's how I did it, it's a little unfriendly to get going, but once it's up, I mean... jeez, dead center, every sound range right where I need it for my particular hearing. My reference was Avi Kaplan's Peace Inside because he's got such a range, his music is simple but hits all the hz for me to tell the difference, unique way that his tone has an airy... scratch to it that I can't catch usually.

THIS IS ALL WINDOWS, I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH MAC

1.) Ask ChatGPT to look at and interpret your audiogram (and it did shockingly well).

2.) Once that's done, ask it to make an EQ file for EQUALIZER APO - [https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/)

3.) Drop that txt file of your hearing ranges into the config folder of Equalizer APO and let it do its thing. Restart your computer.

~~4.) Now you need PeaceEqualizer interface.~~ [~~https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/~~](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/)

~~4.2) This part sucks. In PeaceEqualizer: On the full toolbox, (muck around till you find it, all the way to the right and in the middle) IMPORT that config file.~~

~~4.3) Restart, make sure that it's loaded and turned on.~~

5.) Right click the speaker in your system tray, go to sound settings, select your device, then at the bottom, check to see what spatial sound or other settings are off for now, AND TURN YOUR SOUND WAY DOWN for now, cause you're about to tax your speakers.

6.) Listen to whatever is on your list of songs or movies that give you those big sound field shivers.

6.5) At this point, you're really done, if you're overwhelmed with the process, just stop here, cause next stuff is deep audio nerd territory.

7.) Dicker with maybe adding spatial sound inside the windows sound panel, or using other post processing to fine tune it. I tried it with Dolby Atmos for Headphones turned on and it just... went nutso, so there's money wasted. My suspicion is with the gain and db increases, it might have maxed either my headphones or the Atmos software.

Go to music land with a stupid smile on your face, because it's... just... well it's basically my hearing aids but with that big wide sound field that you almost taste. Hearing aids are great, but they're not really designed with big bass and trill, wide sound in mind. They're to help us hear the world, not the band.

I'm not absolutely sure of this (software engineers, please explain?) but I believe that the Equalizer or PeaceEQ is going in under the radar and changing the sound before windows even gets its hands on it, which to me is a risk I'm willing to take as far as making stupid happen from a software standpoint.

I haven't messed around with individual controls on either panel much yet, but this success needs to be shared. I also haven't yet tried it on the tower pc speakers, honestly cause I'm nervous my neighbors will reach the end of their patience with me.

Lemme know how it works out for you!

Edit: Forgot in my excitement to get this posted to ask what your song is that you listen to for the joy of hearing? That one that you'd test any speakers or headphones against?

EDIT2: I've dropped peace eq from the equation. The program is very nice and once you get used to the clunky interface, it's very good at what it does, for other applications than this. The problem that I found is that it doesn't always play nice with the layers of other audio processing software (windows native stuff, Dolby Atmos for headphones, 7.1 equalization. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DOES NOT SEPARATE LEFT AND RIGHT CHANNELS. Which... my mistake for not realizing.

Also adding: ChatGPT is an awesome tool but it really needs you to look over it's shoulder. I realized after much mucking around, it was readding my audiogram a little funky, so I went back and forced each tone and db in one by one. This gave me an exact file of DB gain per ear, per frequency. Which IMMEDIATELY MAXED everything out and for that, was totally useless. We (me and chatgpt) had to work together to reduce overall gain, then adjust each channel relative to that to make it so that speakers aren't immediately blown or distorted. End result is crisper, without having to crank the volume into the sky or turn it down so far that it's useless. Obviously success is relative, cause, for me, what does 'normal' sound like?",2025-05-12 11:25:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kkq2w0/gamer_headphones_and_pc_audio_eq_software_for_hoh/

A month later, I nearly got hit by a golf cart on campus because I couldn’t hear it approaching. That pushed me to request another audiogram at my hearing aid consult. On paper, the changes were small—just a 5dB drop at a few frequencies in both ear. The 8kHz in the right ear looked improved, but I was guessing at the pattern and hit the button out of reflex.

Beyond the audiogram, things are different. I struggle to tell which direction sound is coming from. I have to work harder to understand soft voices, even when the volume is fine. Some music doesn’t sound as clear—sometimes more like I remember it than actually hearing it. I get listening fatigue fast, a couple of hours wears me down to exhaustion.

My hearing aid tube is hard so I went to change it, and I *cannot* get it off the hearing aid or out of the ear mold. I replaced my ear mold last year so I don’t know if something changed the makeup of it.

I left it in my dryer to warm it up and it made the tube more flexible but it’s still not coming off. Any suggestions?

Edit: YEP turns out it’s glued to the earmold. Annoying.

With some newer HAs, the tubes are unfortunately glued to the earmolds.

Mine are hard to change. Sometimes I have to cut just a little bit of the tube to get it to release. But be careful and don't put your hearing aid.

I’d ask the audiologist to reorder your mold without the tubing glued in. Sounds like a rookie mistake IMO because tubes always have to be replaced, so I don’t know why they’d ever order your mold to be made like that lol",2025-05-09 14:03:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kijafw/help_changing_tubes/

1kh0vqy,hardofhearing,Hearing aids question,"So my girlfriend has Auditory Neuropathy and CP. 

When we first met she would use her hearing aids  very often. Overtime she stopped using them as often and told me the reason was that her ear wax would clog up the hearing aids. She has narrow ear canals and produces excess ear wax (according to her). After learning about this I started to clean the soft rubbered ends out with a needle while being careful not to go in too far. This helped for a while but I think over time the quality of what she would hear through them went down. 

I asked her what else we could do about it and she was adamant that they had to be repaired by somebody back home in Oregon (we live in Arizona) and that they were pretty expensive to replace. 

Well it's been over a year now since I remember her using them and I really want to just do something about this myself. 

Is there anything I could do for her? Could I send them in to a company for cleaning? Buy a new pair?

Any advice is welcomed.


[댓글]
I get my hearing aids cleaned every six months at the place I bought them from which was an audiologists office. Really any place that sells hearing aids or an audiologists office could clean them or point you in a good direction. Hearing aids can be quite expensive so I’d advise calling around to see about cleaning.  They also sell special cleaning brushes for hearing aids or I got some with mine from the doctor office when I bought them.

Audiologist here. The extended receiver tubing (the white tube on the end of the earmold) may have wax in it or further inside the custom earmold. You could bring it to a local clinic to have it cleaned and checked, but they may charge you a fee since they weren't purchased at that clinic. 

She should also have her ears checked for wax.

I have phonaks very similar to these. Dealing with wax is a normal part of hearing aid maintence, it's common and not a big deal. Any audiologist could clean the wax out and replace the wax traps in under 5 minutes. You may have to pay since it's not the audiologist she bought them from, but it's really not a big deal - if she can book a hearing test through insurance they'll probably clean them as a matter of course for free. If the only issue is wax she absolutely *does not need* new hearing aids. 

All that said, it kind of sounds like she maybe just doesn't like wearing them? If the sound quality is bad she may need to get them tuned (again, you may have to pay but it won't be more than $100 for the appointment, compared to thousands for new hearing aids).

The wax filter probably needs to be replaced. The mold needs to be taken off the receiver. Wax filters are cheap and easy enough to replace.

While the molds are off, you can thoroughly clean them. There are two holes that go completely through. Don’t quote me, but I think you can use floss for the holes. The trick is getting the mold off and on without tearing it or breaking the receiver wire. 

The real question is why doesn’t she want to get them cleaned? Two possibilities: she’s overstimulated when wearing them and doesn’t like them. Or she doesn’t want to bother anyone about it.

Sometimes the reason isn’t the reason. It’s possible there are some other things at play here, related to some complex emotions and the social price of hearing loss.

I have bad wax problems, particularly in one ear. If I don't clean them regularly it's really painful when I get them cleaned. So I use Debrox every couple of weeks, just put a few drops in my ear then a small cotton wad, and sleep with it for a night. The wax softens and drains out. By morning it's fairly dry and I just dry them a bit with tissue and my hearing aids don't clog.

It makes a huge difference in sound if the wax filter gets even just partially clogged. It's hard to notice if it's slowly clogging - you just slowly stop hearing. 

My ear molds aren't as comfortable as simple domes, which are much easier to clean.

Also, I wear my aids whenever I'm awake. If I fall asleep for a snooze they're still there afterwards with no problems. I strongly agree that the more you wear them the better they work for you.

She should have been told either by her audiologist or had an information book that tells her how to care for the hearing aids. Google the type of hearing aids to find the manufactures website for instruction. There should be somewhere you can send them for a clean either an independent place or somewhere that manufacturer runs and again if I were you I’d google your area to check



Additionally as she would have been told she will need to get regular hearing checks which will help ensure the hearing aids are perfectly tuned. She may also be eligible for professional ear wax removable but that is something she’ll have to search for.

So not just changing the filters occasionally, that's what ai have to do for wax buildup. Phones user too but slightly different in ear design. À pack of filters are cheap.

So I have hearing aids but I've never been able to wear them. I will only wear them in a quiet environment with an intimate one-on-one conversation of someone such as a doctor because if I wear them like to a store or even driving the background noises are so overwhelming. I'm totally aware that I do the wrong thing and no one should be like me. But I think I have some sort of latent autism I can't stand background noise. I actually felt the fringe benefit about my hearing loss was that it removed all the annoying background noises but as soon as I put the hearing aids in I can't stand it. I can't stand the sound my feet to make when they get the ground sometimes it even feels like my pants are rubbing together and I can hear it.  I can't stand all the ambient noise in the house. I wish I sincerely wish I could change.

You know her best, but I think she might not want to wear them? I’m not sure and like, I don’t even know her, but that’s just the vibe I’m picking up if yk what I mean. Like idk if you have hearing loss or anything but hearing aids are like kind of annoying sometimes. Like idm them and I use them all the time but I love having a break from hearing stuff, like fans and my voice and breathing and just random noises, it gets annoying and overwhelming and it makes me very overstimulated.

I get my hearing aids cleaned, every time I go to Costco. Which is a couple of times a month. Drop them off, do my shopping, then pick them up on the way out. No charge.

I would imagine the clear rubber tubing needs to be replaced, the model I have is similar enough to that and requires the tubes be replaced at least once a year, although twice a year is more ideal.

My phonic hearing aids light up red while charging but never turn green. Is it the charger itself? Already changed block and cord.

1kg4y2a,hardofhearing,Hearing aid keeps falling out,"So I got new hearing aids a few days ago that were set up in the exact same way as the demo ones I had for a month prior that never had this issue (same exact model and the same sized domes) but one keeps popping out of my ear canal and it's driving me crazy as the bigger dome feels uncomfortable (well I only tried different sizes with the demo ones not these ones) and I don't know why I'd need to change the size if the old one worked fine. Is it that the wire thing is not bent in the same way or something? Is there a way I can change that without damaging it? Any other ideas?

You have to give it time to, for lack of a better term, “break in” the wire. It will bend more in the shape of your ear as you wear it more. If it is really an issue, you can get a little piece of plastic added to it, I believe it’s called a retention hook, it just helps hold it in your ear

google hearing aid anchors.  i used them on my first hearing aids.   had the same problem as you.

They should not be falling out. That means an incorrect fit.

When I had my Receiver in Canal (RIC) hearing aids, I tried all the types and sizes of domes and used the retention locks, but just couldn’t get a comfortable and secure fit. So, I finally got ear impressions and ear molds which finally gave me the comfortable, secure fit I was looking for.",2025-05-06 13:48:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kg4y2a/hearing_aid_keeps_falling_out/

1kfniws,hardofhearing,MRI with Cookie Bite Hearing Loss?,"Has anyone had an MRI after being diagnosed with cookie bite hearing loss? I (36F) was just diagnosed a few months ago and the ENT I saw said it was not necessary in her opinion. Wondering if I should push for it or seek a second opinion… it’s on my mind because an acquaintance of mine recently got diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor affecting her vision/hearing and it got me wondering… 

[댓글]
Yes, results were “completely unremarkable”.

Cookie bite hearing loss is far and away most likely to be caused by genetics. In extremely rare cases, it can be caused by a benign neuroma, but this is pretty uncommon. You're at an age where diagnosis is quite common, and so an MRI seems unnecessary, but if it gives you peace of mind and your ENT isn't opposed, I suppose you could get one? Insurance might not cover it.

(I have cookie bite loss).

I was diagnosed at the same age with bilateral sensorineural cookie bite loss and my audiologist just recommended a genetic test to find out if it was an identified genetic/hereditary cause. Nothing found at the time.

I did. I was sent to the ENT for having components of sensorineural hearing loss AND conductive with mid range (cookie bite) hearing loss. While I was there, a fistula test (I think, where they blow air into your ear) set off a 5 day vestibular migraine and I proceeded to have multiple severe ones a month, sometimes to the extent I had more migraine days than not. Never had them prior. I had an MRI and CT to work out if I had issues with my inner ear due to the sensitivity of my vestibular system and the hearing loss. 

Both were negative and I was diagnosed with vestibular migraines over other possible causes and I just deal with my hearing loss with hearing aids. 

I was 23 at the time, almost 26 now. Been 1 year without a vestibular migraine and unsure why, but I am so thankful. I had to take so much time off work, was throwing up every time I got up and could barely look after myself or my animals each time it occurred. I live in fear of them occurring again. 

I am aware my case is different to what you are describing and I’m sorry if it’s not applicable to what you’re after, but my hearing loss was the original sole reason I went to the ENT and my hearing loss PLUS vestibular symptoms is why I had imaging done. They can play hand in hand with many conditions. 

In my case if I wanted to explore my symptoms further I would need surgery on my inner ear to explore possible membrane problems (not able to see on imaging) and I was not keen on that, especially when it may not amount to anything, I can’t afford the time off and my vestibular migraines are now under control. If they were continuing I would 100% of done the surgery as a last ditch effort to possibly fix them as they were ruining my life.

You need to go with it to rule out some tumors.",2025-05-05 21:28:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kfniws/mri_with_cookie_bite_hearing_loss/

[댓글]
Audiologist here. You have two test results here: a tympanogram and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs).

The tympanogram is a measure of eardrum mobility and gives us information about the status of the middle ear. A ""Type A"" tympanogram indicates normal middle ear status and normal eardrum mobility. A type ""As"" tympanogram indicates stiff eardrum mobility and can indicate several things such as middle ear fluid or a thickened eardrum. 

The OAE test is an objective measurement of the organ of hearing's outer hair cells.  One of the more common causes of hearing loss is outer hair cell damage. The machine plays two tones into the ear and, if the organ is functioning properly, the organ will emit a third tone (a cubic difference tone) that is loud enough for the same machine to measure it. The OAE responses are the dots, the gray shading is the ""noise floor"" indicating how noisy your child was during the test. The responses need to be a certain level above the noise floor for them to be counted as present; because the dots are hardly above the noise floor, this is not a passing result. 

Was your child quiet for the exam? Even small noises like feeding from a bottle, movement, or newborn grunting can cause high noise floors. We cannot determine degree of hearing loss based off this test, but responses are more likely to be present with no worse than a mild amount of hearing loss.

First of all, the docs have no idea what they’re talking about. Ditch them lol You need to see an ENT who knows what they’re looking at when they look at your child’s ears. A lot of ENTs have an audiologist in the office or someone they could send you to to have a licensed hearing professional look at the audiograms or do further hearing tests.",2025-05-05 19:11:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kfk33w/result_help/

1kespg5,hardofhearing,"Advice needed please, regarding hubby's hearing","Okay. 

Our relationship has always been ridiculous lol but we fit together perfectly. 

We are both struggling with some extreme health issues. 

He's losing his hearing. We have been told it has to do with the bones in his ears and they recommended hearing aids. 

Sad thing is we can't afford the nice name brand ones which were 10k so we went to Costco and dropped 2500. 

(I am currently dealing with tracheal stenosis and it just makes it so difficult to talk. It takes SO much energy to forcefully yell out words at him)

It's like the hearing aids are no longer working? We were told it wouldn't make his hearing worse but it feels like it has had a catastrophic decline. 

He keeps hearing people when they talk but not hearing them. 

For example. Pulled up to a drive through today. 

Guy said very clearly and loudly. ""One moment please"" and my hubby just starts yelling the order into the speaker. 

This happens in person too. He can tell someone's talking but cannot hear them. 

What on earth can I do to help him ? 

I can't imagine how lost he must feel losing his hearing. Especially so young. 

I celebrated his new hearing aids and was so excited for him. 

But now it's just driving me bonkers. 

These hearing aids are only 1 year old. His other set had to be replaced after 3 years. (Costco set as well) 

The other drawback is these have Bluetooth capabilities and when he should be present in conversation he's got the dang videos playing on his phone or listening to an audio book. 

Then it sets you back to repeating yourself and nauseam. 

I spoke with him about only using the bluetooth capabilities at appropriate times, so that seems to have mostly resolved. 

However, he constantly hears someone but doesn't. 

I'm praying this makes sense to someone because it's maddening for me. 

I want him to experience a full life and be able to hear everyone. 

I miss our conversations (and hopefully my side will improve dramatically once insurance hurries up and approved the stupid surgery to help with the stenosis) 

Thanks in advance. 

I love my hubby dearly. 

I can't twll if this is a hearing aid problem, a geouch idgaf man problem (I don't think it is though?) or what's up? 

Do folks that use hearing aids have to concentrate more? 

I'm just at a loss. 

Thank you.

Hearing aids don’t fix your hearing. But they do help you hear more. If people mumble, are facing away from you, or your back is to them….you may not be able to hear what they said. If someone is a distance away or behind a mask or other object, you probably won’t hear them either. 

At times I have to put my volume all the way up based on the circumstances.

If I am listening to something through Bluetooth on my hearing aids then I can’t hear what someone else is saying to me. Unless I mute whatever I am listening to.

It’s a daily process to hear things and people. It takes work.

“These have Bluetooth capabilities and when he should be present in conversation he’s got the dang videos playing on his phone” you just answered your own question.

Have his ears checked and hearing aids cleaned or tuned. 1 year old hearing aids won’t need to be replaced.

Like the others have said, hearing aids help a ton.   But nothing can give me normal hearing.  I have to face my husband for us to have a conversation in a restaurant.    Sound does exist behind me, but it isn't necessarily usable for conversation.  

If it's been a year, is he able to have another hearing test done at Costco and have them adjusted?  About 6 months or so before the warranty expires have them sent in and the battery replaced.

Echoing others, have hearing retested and also request ""real ear measures."" Costco will know what that is. My hearing aids are ancient from Costco and I've been happy with them.

What he is experiencing is likely something called a processing gap. Your ears physically hear sound, send that to your brain. Your brain turns the sound into words. When you have hearing loss, your ears are sending less information so your brain is filling in the gaps to varying degrees of success. Lip reading and context clues help your brain make better guesses. So it makes sense he would struggle at things like drive throughs, his brain is so expecting to hear something like ""go ahead"" so it turns the information the ears sent into that.

Using myself as an example, based on my audiogram I can technically only hear about 50 percent of speech. In most contexts you would not notice it even without my hearing aids because my brain compensates using lip reading and context clues and most of the time I make good guesses or just mimic the facial expression the person is making. That is exhausting and causes interpersonal problems so I wear hearing aids.

A good example of this for you to understand is those videos that have sort of vague noises and words on the screen. Your brain usually will turn the vague noises into the words even if they aren't there.

Echoing what others have said here about hearing aids not making your hearing ""normal"". 

Though, I have to wonder. Did they ever look deeper into why he has bone conductive hearing loss?

Based upon over 63 years as a profound hard of hearing person(hearing about 15% at the most in one ear) with hearing aids for all of that time, typically, the higher frequencies are lost first, which are the frequencies needed to hear the soft fricative sounds that most consonants are composed of. These include c, f, h, k, p, q, s, and t. Basically, I hear only vowel sounds now, so lip reading comes into play to determine what consonant sounds are being pronounced. Most the lip shapes for each consonant  are easily visible, as are the vowel sounds. Combining lip reading with any sounds I can hear, means I get by most of the time, which is pretty good for only having 15% hearing. Of course, the background environment has a huge effect on how well I do. Things that interfere with perception of speech(lip reading) are poor lighting as in dark environments e.g. A car police stop with flashlights/torches shining into your eyes at night time; noisy background e.g. Parties with a hubbub of background speech or music blaring; noisy work environments like construction sites; speakers covering their mouths or facing away while talking e.g. teachers who face blackboards; speakers with accents; speakers who mumble or don't move their lips much; speakers who babble or stutter or speak rapidly; non-native English speakers who do not enunciate each word correctly or use non-English cadence rhythm; beards or moustaches that obscure lips.there are many more, and each causes mental and physical stress, as they obscure the act of lip reading while trying to figure out which of a number of letters was pronounced, which is combined with any audio heard, to give about 2, 3 or 4 words in about the same number of sentences, which one has to use context to figure out the most likely correct sentence. This is exhausting, which means sustained lip reading cannot be done for long before crashing from fatigue. Sustained lip reading often leads to a tunnel vision effect, where almost only the lips are seen, most disconcerting, so I look away for a moment to relax my eyes, which means I immediately no longer know what is said, so must ask for repetition. Try lip reading in classes for 6 hours a day in school/college/university, which makes one very tired/stressed, making studying difficult. Notetakers/tutors are needed to fill in lots of gaps. 
Isolation will occur, as a child/teen I could hear better, so mixed more socially but did not meet other deaf/hard of hearing persons until my 20's(hard to believe) so I never learned sign language until my 20's when I began to wonder where all the other deaf/hard of hearing were and decided to learn, so I could interact with them. The issue with learning signing later in life, is that signing from childhood, the brain develops visual processing to a greater depth, so that one can focus upon facial expression for context information(e.g. Emotional states such as sad, happy, anxious, emphasis etc) while seeing associated signing in the foreground. This means sign language conveys much more parallel streams of information than speech does. Learning signing as an adult does not enable this extra brain development - I must physically look at the signing, missing the extra information being conveyed by the signers facial expressions. This means I'm unable to follow full speed signing, because I can't look at both face and hands at the same time - very limiting in social interactions, making it difficult to integrate, so as a result, as I hear less and less, I become more socially isolated from both the hearing and deaf worlds.
You will need to keep all of this in mind when talking with him. Being habitually stressed seems normal to me from early childhood, so I handle it better, but to have this happen as an adult is extremely debilitating/depressing/isolating. Take classes in speech-reading together - there's going to be lots of adjustment. Look for hard of hearing groups in your area - they can provide you with helps/advice etc. to more easily cope. Good luck, and remember for both of you to have patience and compassion with each other, and that it's just a communication issue. Remember to face each other when communicating-gentle arm/should taps to begin this process of gaining attention first.
You'll meet people who are well-meaning/idiots/discriminatory etc.
A fond memory is of the nuns at a primary school in 7th grade discovering I couldn't follow speech on the radio for a class exercise, missing most words, and having me stay back after school to, ""practise listening to the radio to recognize more words, so I'd get better at it"".  Of course, being unable to lip read speech from a radio should seem obviously unworkable, but this was the late 1960's. In fairness, they did take me to a speech therapist in another town on a regular basis, which helped me to learn to pronounce words properly that I couldn't hear, which was nice of them. I read books/encyclopedias by the ton, hence my great writing skills :-)
P.S. Have captioning turned on for the tv from now on, makes a huge difference!

Hearing but not understanding is very common &amp; difficult for loved ones to grasp. He is fortunate to have yop in his corner.
I've been learning ASL as i lose my hearnng. It's wonderful for those that have the passion to learn. Who knows, maybe that will apply to you.

Maybe i'm wrong, but i think costco are pretty decent.  I suspect more important than spending more money on hearing aids is consistency using them, and actively paying attention to the listening environment. You may also consider using a live listen or FM receiver function if they have them for that model (i think they do).  That would allow you to speak with him fairly easily in noisy environments. Unfortunately, it makes it worse for hearing ambient noise.

You describe a common problem: with my hearing aids, I hear lots of sounds, whispers, breezes, and birds others can't hear. But I can only interpret about half of what someone says, even when they're up close and speaking loudly. They sound like Daffy or Daisy Duck. Practice at lip reading and watching facial expressions helps and the more practice, the better.

I was reluctant at first to do this, but now I frequently pull out my phone and hit Live Transcribe, which is free and available on most phones. It gives me captions, and if I miss something I glance down, and it usually decodes the speech OK. I was embarassed at first, but nobody really minds. If they do they're probably not worth listening to.

Shop around. I got a good pair of oticons for $3000

This is why I will never recommend anyone going to Costco to get HA’s. Your hearing is too precious to settle for aids that are cheaper and may not do what you want. 

I don’t have any advice, except for in the future, go to an actual audiologist practice. My HA’s are about $6 or $7k retail and I “lease” them through my audiologist for $190 ish dollars a month. At the end of 5 years, I can turn them in and get brand new ones that have even better technology and start the process over again.

Audiologists that have their own practice have much more extensive knowledge about brands and what would work for your hubby’s hearing loss. Each brand has its own speciality, and there’s no way Costco could carry all of them, so your selection is very limited. I get they sell them for cheaper, but is it worth it?

Nothing will work as well as prescribed hearing aids so unfortunately this will likely continue until you can get him prescription ones.

Yup. Every time I ruptured my ear drum I had to have surgery. I also have donor ear drums so mine don’t have the capability to repair themselves. Coming from a girl who has had 14 surgeries- it sucks, but there’s nothing you can do to avoid it. The only thing I can say that has helped me avoid having a tympanoplasty in many, many years is being SUPER vigilant when I have colds and the minute I feel pressure in my ear, I will call my ENT and try to get on antibiotics. My surgeon said that is the worst thing for a tympanic membrane- the fluid you get in your ear and then it starts pushing on that membrane and if yours is surgically created, it will always be the most vulnerable.

I will say, technology has changed surgery by leaps and bounds since I had my last one, so it might not be as bad as the one you remember from 10 years ago.

Had five surgeries. Left ear never healed right. Right was good for 5-6 years. ENT recommended Cocherlar Osia to totally skip ears all together. Like hearing aids they are not waterproof and hard to wear baseball hat.

I can relate but in a weird way. I was raised in [Christian Science,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science) a cult that believes disease and disability are caused by sin and can be cured by working on those. 

There was no such thing as acknowledging I was disabled in my household. I can’t hear a thing outside of 6 feet (1.83 meters) and ideally would have people within 3 feet (.93 meters) to hear clearly. I instead had to learn to read lips so people could stand farther away. 

My speech was also a point of criticism. Some words sounded a little funny so I struggled to learn to say them. I had to say them repeatedly until I got it right. I speak well now so credit to them for that but *man* did I not know what was happening as a kid.

Same exact thing happened to me. I was always told I was born with some hearing loss. I didn't get hearing aids until my early 30's. The audiologist was surprised I hadn't had any yet. It really explains a lot of my social struggles growing up. I couldn't hear well enough in a group to contribute anything, so I was always the quiet one. Mine is mostly higher frequency hearing loss, but my lower end is just fine. It really made it harder to understand lyrics to songs and my wife still makes fun of me for singing all the wrong lyrics I've misheard throughout the years.

Kinda feel the same but also kinda opposite. Born bilateral conductive hearing loss and grew up wearing hearing aids. In senior year of high school I had tympanoplasty surgeries that fixed my hearing. Then noticed issues that I thought might be sensitivity issues to low frequencies. And realized that I’ve been experiencing this for a long time, maybe close to my entire life. I noticed a discrepancy where articles on low frequency hearing loss tend to mention conductive hearing loss and LFN triggers but articles on conductive hearing loss don’t mention anything about LFN triggers. I think I, my family, friends, educators could have benefited from being aware of triggers. I feel like I’m in the same boat over feeling a rollercoaster of emotions, from depression to relieve to anger and etc. Trying to figure out a life plan, setup coping strategies. Currently working on a website to organize my experiences and recent research into something coherent. I got diagrams and analogies modeling real world systems.

i relate in a different way, i thought my hearing loss was from listening to loud metal music so i just suffered my entire adult life until now (im 52) When i got tested my hearing loss isn’t even from music lol

I have profound deafness in my left ear that was diagnosed in 4th grade at first hearing screening. I’ve had many many surgeries (tubes and more). Besides that, my parents never acknowledged it. Never crossed my mind to speak about it since no one else did.  Finally got hearing aids at 63 because my other ear had begun failing as well.  Hearing aids have been life changing.  I keep asking, “what’s that sound?”.  It’s really a miracle.  There are still things I don’t hear or at least not correctly but I think miss less.  I do, however, enjoy taking my hearing aids out and enjoying the quiet when no one is around.

My granddad's hearing loss and being unable to communicate with us was the inspiration behind XRAI Glass. Might be worth checking out: https://xrai.glass

Might be a little late to responding to this post, but I have been struggling with these very same feelings recently so I still wanted to pop in and say yeah, i get it.

I (31F) have been fully deaf in my right ear since the age of 5 due to a childhood illness. Despite the typical ""you're really deaf in this ear"" response from my audiologist after a hearing test, and the look of concern, I was never offered any resources. My mom says she used to ask me if I wanted to learn sign, but I was young, I wanted to fit in with my peers, and how would that help me in a hearing school?

Fast forward to now and I just had the stark realization of the impact this had on my education and social skills. I found a work around with socializing that seemed to be acceptable, but since realizing this, I have felt the full weight that socializing this way has on my energy levels. 

It has been really hard to cope while having virtually no one who can relate. I actually came to reddit today hoping that I could find a sense of community. If you would like someone to talk to about what you're feeling, feel free to DM me. I cant promise ill be able to help too much, but maybe we both can find some solice in having someone to relate to.",2025-05-03 16:47:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kdxc9g/family_knew_about_hearing_loss_but_didnt_help/

1kcmvpm,hardofhearing,Wanted to get clarification..,"So let me start with my hearing loss is recent. I had cancer and received treatment for it over the summer (2024). I am now 7ish months post-treatment (and in remission) and went to have a new hearing test done. They had told me that the chemo meds they used had about a 6 month half life so I waited till I was at least that far out to retest and have my hearing aids adjusted. They had told me I probably wouldn't get much ""bounce back"" (meaning lost hearing healing) since it was uniform across the 3 ways they tested. I did get a very small amount back in my low range but had greater loss in my higher ranges. It moved into the ""Severe Loss"" range. One audiologist said she wouldn't describe my loss as severe overall even though it's in the 80 decibel range. It's both ears and I now wear hearing aids on both sides. They are very hard to see so most of my coworkers (I started a new job recently) don't realize I have them. They will speak to me in passing, in noise, or without looking in my direction. I often struggle to hear them and have to ask them to repeat themselves, or to speak up, etc. I wear a lanyard with my ID and keycard around my neck. I was thinking of putting on a pin that says that I am hard of hearing. But, I also don't exactly know if I should use this term? I don't want to misuse the term. I wouldn't want to make light of the situation for people who have more universal hearing loss by using the term if it's not accurate/appropriate to my situation, if that makes sense? So, I am basically looking for some etiquette guidance from the HOH community. Thank you!

I don’t think you need to worry about some gatekeeper being nitpicky here. “Hard of hearing” encompasses a wide range of hearing loss and affects people in different ways, to different degrees. 

I think a pin would be a great idea. I have one that I sometimes use when going into situations with people I don’t see often, or large meetings. 

People who aren’t completely self-centered or jerks will adjust their behavior, but it’ll take time. And lots of patience. Maybe make sure your manager and HR know so they can help navigate any bumpiness along the way.

If it is hard for you to hear, you are hard of hearing! Congrats! But also sorry!!!

I tell everyone at my office so no one thinks I am ignoring them. You could maybe do this during a staff meeting or in a group chat or via your manager.

Your identity is your choice. Deaf is a spectrum and you’re on it. Most of the time, I’m hard of hearing. Some of the time, at the Costco food court, a busy coffee shop, or a concert, I’m deaf. Please waive when my order is ready. 

A pin on your work lanyard is your choice, but I wouldn’t do it. Though I have a sign at my desk that says to get my attention before talking to me. The only time I publicize my deafness is at comic con. But they actually have a ton of terps and it’s easier to just point at the pin.",2025-05-01 23:30:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kcmvpm/wanted_to_get_clarification/

Pardon if silly question. Why not take devices out while shooting? Like bring a case, sign in, then take them out?

I just take mine out and put the foam ones in and then the safety ear muffs over top. 🤷‍♀️

I tuck my hearing aid in my bag and then put it back in as soon as I’m out.

I personally double up on earpro when shooting and would not recommend wearing aids - unless this is for a class or drills or something? If so you may want to talk to the instructor to see if there are possible accommodations re: separate class and range portions?

Just remove them. I put them in their case when I am riding my motorcycle. Never had an issue.

Take them out and then in ear hearing protection with big earmuff style protection over it. You’re already hard of hearing don’t mess around.

Just take them out. Very very few headcans can accommodate BTE devices. 

You don't need to hear to shoot.

https://a.co/d/5lMMORV I use these they amplifies voice and muffles when the guns go off, it’s for shooting range type war muffs wear you need to hear the instructor

Turn it off or not wear it.

1kcepdq,hardofhearing,Weird symptoms after ear surgery — sharp pain and cracking sound?,"I had ear surgery (tympanoplasty) about 3 months ago on my right ear. Everything was fine at first — no pain, no problems. But about a month later I got a really bad cold and coughed strong non-stop for weeks, and that’s when things started getting weird.

Now I’ve been having:

Sharp headaches on the right side that last for days (sometimes so bad I cry)
A feeling of pressure or discomfort in that ear (not sharp pain, just uncomfortable)
A few times I felt a bit dizzy or unbalanced
The area behind my ear feels bigger or harder, but not swollen or red
Greenish liquid ends up in my mouth/throat in the mornings
And just today, when I used my ear drops (which never hurt before), I felt a sharp pain and heard a weird cracking or popping sound
Now every time I use the drops, it hurts — which is totally new. I’m kinda freaking out wondering if something broke or if there’s some kind of infection going on.

Has anyone else gone through this? Does it sound like my eardrum graft got messed up? I’m in a place where getting good medical help is really hard right now, so I’d really appreciate any advice.

At a glance, microphones on the glasses are good. Speakers on the arms may not be compatible with hearing aids. Transcription and translation are still done on the phone via Microsoft, meaning you still need cellular data or WiFi for them to work. 

Because of the microphones, they may work marginally better than relying on the phone microphones. 

Ethically, the website says the cofounder is HH. They seem to be purpose built for the d/hh community. But there’s no way to know who the investors are or what kind of profit margins they have.

Very curious as well. At this point, I have normal (if not barely mild) loss on one side, but mostly normal. And severe on the other so they may not be for me… yet. But as loss progresses I am happy this type of tech exists. 

I understand ASL and the value, but some of us developed hearing impairment while older and something like this can be a godsend.

1kbdqya,hardofhearing,We need a pair of Starkey hearing aids for cybersecurity research.,"Hey everyone, 

  
I am a security researcher based in the Netherlands. I am not 100% deaf, but I am monohearing (deaf side left side yo) and one of my colleagues is profoundly HoH and needs uses Starkey hearing aids. 

  
He has severe worries about the security of these devices and we want to spend time performing research on these devices to fully understand how they could be attacked by a malicious entity. We both work as cybersecurity consultants, so we have the skills, he just doesn't want to experiment and perform cyber research against his devices as he would be stuck without the ability to hear if we break them accidentally. 

  
They're also quite expensive and he doesn't have the financial ability to buy new ones if we break these. I suggested to him that I ask here on the chance that someone has some old ones they can post us and we could perhaps make the issue clear to Starkey and force them to secure these medical devices against attack appropriately. 

  
Only requirement: It needs to be the kind with bluetooth support, any version with Bluetooth would be appropriate for this research project.

I’m gonna be honest. It seems like he has anxiety and paranoia about it. You can do your experiments, sure, but he may need counseling to address the root of his issues.

Sorry, I don't use Starkey. Out of curiosity, what kind of attacks do you think could be made on them?

Audiologist here. There is a special mode for hearing aids such as Starkey that eliminates wireless communication for this reason. People with hearing loss may work in areas that handle sensitive information. It's called SCIF mode, your friend can have this activated by his audiologist if he's really that paranoid about it, but to my knowledge it is not something the user can toggle on/off, the audiologist needs to set this to either on or off.

While I understand he doesn’t want to subject his own hearing aids because of the risk that they get broken and he has to go without… that goes for every hearing aid user, no? If he won’t then why are you expecting others to take the risk? I have starkeys with Bluetooth connectivity (and live in Belgium) but can’t for the life of me miss them and don’t have the funds to replace them if something happens so I’m not going to risk them either… 

Wouldn’t Starkey themselves be interested in research like this? Can’t you contact them, explain what you want to do and maybe they can lend you a pair or two to try this out on? Like ethical hacking, iykwim

Yeah that comes included for patients here. 

However if someone wants the best quality hearing aid then ye they will pay more. 

My aid costed me over 2k but it has a lot of power in it.

1kawlzr,hardofhearing,Frustrated - HoH/Work/Insurance issues,"I was previously diagnosed with mild to moderate hearing loss, but worked a remote job with no phone work so it didn’t affect my job. So much so that I didn’t notice how badly my hearing had deteriorated over the years. 

I have a different position now, which is hybrid and requires two days a week in the office and phone work. I struggled on the phones and with communicating with peers to the point where it caused a small altercation at work. Since then, my employer has been hassling me to get my hearing re-evaluated and to get a set of hearing aids. They’ve denied my request for a louder phone/headset, and stated the only way they could make that “accommodation” was for me to work with an audiologist and obtain hearing aids first. 

So I got scheduled with a new audiologist in my new state, I now have moderate to severe hearing loss, and obviously hearing aids were recommended. 

I went to my hearing aids consult this morning, just to find out that my employer who pressured me into this offers their employees health plans with ZERO hearing aid coverage. The pair recommended for my loss and lifestyle are $5555, and I would need to pay the entire cost out of pocket at the time of fitting. 

I am so lost and frustrated. 

[댓글]
They cannot require you to get hearing aids in order to receive an accommodation. If they have 15 or more employees (the number is lower in some states), they have to make reasonable accommodations for your disability, and phone amplification is such a basic thing to ask for.

Edited: Meant to type 15, accidentally typed 50. Fixed.

Try Costco. You can get hearing aids for about 1/5 of that price.

Thanks all. 

Per the advice here and from my audiologist who was also frustrated by my lack of coverage, I have an intake scheduled with my local division of vocational rehabilitation next month. The person who I spoke to over the phone seemed confident that they’d be able to assist, and they already have a working relationship with the office my current audiologist is based out of. Fingers crossed something affordable and beneficial comes of this.

I definitely recommend going to your vocational rehabilitation office. Also, hearing aids won’t necessarily help on the phone without additional devices or support. If you go to an audiologist they may help you request a caption phone or an amplified phone from your employer. Sometimes you can get devices (paid for by VR) that you can hook into the phone to stream sound to your hearing aids or use at meetings to better understand the conversation. Working with your VR and asking them to help you get set up with an audiologist is really helpful! It might take some time but it will eventually make a difference. I’m going through the process now for the second time because my job and needs have changed slightly. I turned in the application today and will hopefully hear what the next steps are over the next week or so. I’ll meet with the audiologist and then she’ll give her recommendations to the VR and they’ll let me know if I need to contribute or not. It’s a great process if you have access and it gets you established with a professional that can help you.

Just as an FYI. The most a job can really require for HOH accommodation is a recent hearing test (usually in the last 6 months) and a letter from your audiologist with their recommendations for your specific workplace needs. Most corporate jobs will usually have a form, provided by HR, that the doctor fills out instead of a letter.They legitimately can not require you to purchase medical equipment to do your job.


Also, as someone with moderate/severe bilateral hearing loss that's worked in a fair few call centers, you can't wear most hearing aids while wearing a headset. It fucks with the microphones, producing weird internal feedback in your head. The equipment they're trying to force you into won't even work with what you're going to end up needing.


What you need to have your doctor ask for is a phone headset with active noise cancelation. Jabra is a headset manufacturer that makes gear specifically for call centers and executives. I've had excellent luck with the different styles I've had over the years. I actually still use my work-provided Bluetooth headset with my personal phone.

I’d hire a lawyer to send them a letter informing them of what they have to do under the law.

Yep. I have “goood” health insurance as a public school teacher but my HA are not covered at all.

Check out the askjan.org website for workplace accommodation possibilities

Ask the audiologist for lower cost versions of the recommended hearing aids. Many hearing aids are so overloaded with features that may not be appropriate or necessary for you. And some audiologists may be pushing for hearing aids with higher profit margins.

Uh, my advice? Document all of this in writing, and save every email. If it is verbal, write an email to whomever is saying they will not accommodate this and say “just to clarify and recap our conversation, you will not provide accommodations and are referring me to get my hearing looked at?” Make sure they respond and print that out and save it for your records because it sounds like they are itching to fire you. It is illegal to not make reasonable accommodations and they cannot tell you or push you to do or buy anything. Please read the ADA. 

I would say a very, very large chunk of insurances do not pay for HA’s. I have worn them for over 30+ years and have not found an insurance that covers them. Some insurances will offer programs where you can get them discounted. I “lease” mine through my audiologists office and pay about $190/month so I don’t have to buy them outright. Mine retail between $6-7k.",2025-04-29 19:27:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kawlzr/frustrated_hohworkinsurance_issues/

What jobs good for people with hearing issues? preferably the ones with less talking and taking in instructions. I suck at instructions and I'm yet to meet a psychiatrist for this. I'm only diagnosed hearing so far but i felt like there's underlying reasons about myself too. I'm asian and my family is gonna get tired of me being unemployed soon and blame everything on me like what happened last time. Please suggest me jobs for hearing issues. I tried online such as upwork and fiver but I always get ignored. also i don't have hearing aid and i can't afford it.

Have you used Voc rehab? You can receive job search assistance, job interview practice, and help with assistive tech possibly.

I personally loved data entry because you do you'll be doing your own thing 95% of the time.  It is harder to find those jobs now though.

I had the same issues. I was a SAHM for years when my ex left me and the kids and I had to find work. Failed many interviews for retail, food service, etc. Went to the local Vocational Rehab office for advice, help and they were wonderful. They found me an audiologist who fitted me for aids and helped me find a job. I have been at that job for almost 7 years now and while I don't love it, I am happy enough. I work with a completely deaf worker and she has been teaching me to sign and 1 of our managers knows how to sign enough to make sure we always know what we need to do our tasks. 

So. Look up info for your local Vocational Rehab office and talk to them and see what they can do to help.

Do you have a post-secondary education? Any experience that you can show off that you're just as capable in some field as any other hearing person? It's going to be hard for people like us, and especially so depending on the country you live in and the discrimination laws. Do you have a vehicle? Some more context on your personal life is going to allow us to point you in a much better direction.

Typically, the best ""no-experience/no post-secondary education"" jobs fit for some of us will be something like:

Data Entry, Stocking (overnight for even less communication)/Inventory/packaging, document filing + scanning, hands-on blue collar work, Doordash-type jobs, housekeeping. Jobs that require some form of communication also don't need to be completely thrown out the window; tools like captioned telephones (i.e. CapTel) and Real-Time Captioning (CART) devices can be an enormous help.

Can you share your exact education or any experiences you have?   
Are you good with computers? Data entry? Or stocker - tasks like unpacking deliveries, stocking shelves, sorting goods?  
Or maybe a gardener with outdoor work like planting, mowing, trimming?   
And if you have a driver’s licence, delivering goods (like packages, food, groceries) is very independent.  
  
And what kind of hearing loss do you have? Like single sinded or bilateral, and how much? I mean, does your hearing loss impact your daily life?   
And did you try some vocational rehab centers that offer free or low-cost hearing aids for low-income adults?

What about starting your own online business?

1k9aqp1,hardofhearing,Imbalanced Hearing,"Hi, I don’t know if this is the right place to post as I’m not exactly hard of hearing, but I already posted on r/AskDocs and r/DiagnoseMe and got no answers, so I’m hoping I can find someone here with some relevant knowledge.

Probably relevant history: Around November last year, I went to a very loud concert (Apple Watch registered 105 dB, yes I was dumb), and also had a case of swimmer’s ear, for which I saw an ENT and got treatment until it healed without complications). I also have a severely deviated septum to the right.

Since then, my hearing has been slightly offset to the right, most noticeable when wearing headphones. I’ve also had some tinnitus which mostly went away but is still slightly noticeable in my right ear when it is very quiet (like when going to sleep). I have had a hearing test done which showed I can hear all frequencies at 10 dB, aside from 4 KHz at 20 dB, in both ears.

Unfortunately, I have to use headphones regularly and this has become fatiguing and annoying. The ENT who did my hearing test said he can’t help me (and honestly felt like he didn’t believe me). Do I have any chance to regain balanced hearing or will I have to put up with this forever?

[댓글]
From my understanding as a non professional the ability to regain hearing depends on the type of hearing loss. If the dip you have is at 20db then it’s perfectly reasonable that your ent said they can’t help. That’s because at 20db you’re hearing is still considered within normal range it’s not considered loss.

Audiologist here: did you have your hearing tested by an audiologist at the ENT's office, or did the ENT themselves administer the hearing test? What tests did they run?

Hello there how are you now? I have had very similar circumstances 2 and a half weeks ago with around 2-4 hours at a party with up to 115db as per my Apple Watch - since then my hearing has felt off centre / imbalanced too , with my left ear feeling much weaker but my hearing tests show both my ears being near identical",2025-04-27 18:24:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k9aqp1/imbalanced_hearing/
1k8xudv,hardofhearing,What are some things you didn’t know made a sound?,"I recently learned that stomachs make an actually audible sound and it was mind blowing. What other things make a sound that you didn’t realize?

[댓글]
The turn signals in your car make an audible click that is in time with the blinking light! I had no idea!

I hadn’t heard myself pee in years.  On first wearing my hearing aids to work I tried to stop mid flow thinking everyone outside must be able to hear me. 
A colleague eating crisps, the packet rustling was quite startling at first. 
I bought a tin of WD40 and lubricated all of the door hinges.  I had never heard the racket the doors made.

Paper, like a sheet of paper if you shake it makes noise. Light switches, anything with buttons, so many things click audibly and I had no idea until I got hearing aids. Air/water moving through pipes in the walls of buildings, wind howling (a phrase I assumed was metaphorical, but no it sounds like actually howling at times, that was news to me).

When I got my hearing aids, I was re-introduced to the sound of my pants swishing when I walk. And I had forgotten how loud zippers can be

A fart.

My one cat squeaks about 5x as much as I realized.  It makes me smile every time I hear her.

I worked in a fish market and we had some kind of device in our ceiling that made shaved ice (we went through a few hundred pounds a day). I was surprised to learn it wasn’t silent for everyone else too. 

We also had a deli counter type set up. I’ve lost my hearing in a way that I could hear a high pitched whining noise coming from the refrigeration underneath. Took it breaking down twice for me to figure out that “hey it’s too quiet in here” meant we needed a repairman

Leafs rustling! It's my favorite thing to hear with my hearing aids!!

I'm doing med and a quick way to test if a patient's hearing has changed since their last appointment is to rub your fingers together near their ear, then move your hand away and ask them when they can't hear ""it"" anymore. When I got taught that, I didn't know what on earth they meant, and asked the tutor what they meant by hear ""it"", thinking I'd misheard him. He didn't give me a clear answer so I asked again and then he got angry thinking I was purposefully provoking him or something and I left the class early because I was so embarrassed. Once I was home my mum explained to me that skin rubbing against itself creates a sound and that's why rubbing your fingers together is a test for hearing. I still don't know what sound it's supposed to make but that cleared things up a lot. I do also remember the first thing I learnt made a sound that I didn't know it did, which was footsteps. I hate it! What do you mean you can HEAR where I'm going???

Everything is so click-y! Just the button on the side of my phone makes a click which blew my mind.

Also one of my coworkers told me last week that styrofoam makes a sound she hates, and I am now so curious what kind of sound it is

Most things aren't sound I *couldn't hear* they just sound different. 

But our ceiling fans and the trucks driving past our house surprised me. And my car makes some type of beeping sound when you turn it one that I either wasn't hearing or it has a completely different tone now. 

So many songs that have cymbals and bass, so many men's voices that are so much deeper and clearer than I knew! I heard an Ed Sheeran song the other day and I wouldn't have recognized his voice if I hadn't known the song!

I don't remember if I already knew this made a sound before my diagnosis, but I can't hear my footsteps without my hearing aids which is disconcerting.

My flip flops flip flopping :)

Many moons ago, on the first day of wearing hearing aids, I heard my parents creek and also the birds chirping for the first time ever. I cried.🥹

Birds. Not just that they made sound but they also have different calls. One of the first birds I heard after getting new-fangled digital hearing aids made a throaty noise like a frog. When I asked why I couldn’t find a frog, I was informed that it was a bird.

Clocks ticking. 

Crickets. Flies. Bees. Butterflies. Mice in the walls. 

The full range of sound made by a tornado siren. 

Noises cars make that indicate repairs are needed: knocks, squeaks, pinging

Plus any sounds my husband asks me to investigate without telling me what sound to listen for 😣

The day my 3 year old son got his hearing aids, he was absolutely amazed at the sound of the garage door opening/closing

My husband is a writer and reads me his stories. At one point a character was talking on the phone and could hear *someone walking barefoot on concrete* on the other end. I stopped everything to argue with him bc there's no fucking way you can hear that through a phone. 

Turns out I was wrong.

Hearing other people breathing!!

On the flip side, without my hearing aides, I hear sounds that don’t exist. Well, not outside of my head at least. I used to get upset in the middle of the night when I would “hear” my family poking around in the kitchen. I’d also hear things like bedroom doors closing, car doors closing, drawers opening/closing, and street traffic noises.

It turns out I’m really hearing the noise from my ears! Specifically, when I swallow, yawn, or otherwise mess with the air pressure in the eustachian tube, I hear my tympanic membrane flexing. But I swear it sounds exactly like all that stuff I mentioned above. Weird!

I still hear it even if I’m hoh however my hoh friend got so chocked when I told her the electric timers you turn to set a time when the lamp will be on and off😂.

The slippers I thought made me ninja-level stealthy? Not so much. They SQUEAK. I’m certain my wife could hear me coming from half a block away 😂 🥷

My dog as he walked along the hardwood floor. I could hear his nails as they touched the floor.

My computer keyboard when I type.

When I got my hearing aid and left the hospital, you gotta take an elevator to the parking garage and it was so LOUD i thought it was breaking, i had no idea they made so much noise

out of curiosity, why do you think a personal one would be beneficial? I’ve had hearing aids since before your daughter‘s age and had a Roger Mike since I was in middle school and have never used it outside of school until I got to college, and even then I only use it for meetings

My son just got hearing aids at 5 years old and we use the personal Roger mic all the time. He is learning self advocacy skills and has asked us to wear it when we’re in the car, especially if we’re driving on the freeway. He has also asked us to wear it on windy days if we’re walking outside.  We have his soccer and gym coaches use it as well.",2025-04-26 22:57:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k8pjjw/roger_mic_recommendations/
1k8kfiw,hardofhearing,4 year old HOH,"So my 4 year old *finally* did the test well enough to get her hearing tested. She failed 2 hearing tests in the hospital as a newborn. Than after SEVERAL miscommunication between the our doctor and the hospital where we went to for her ABRs [got sent 2 and a half hours away 4x because they weren't communicating with eachother. FINALLY got the sedated ABR and it diagnosed her with sensinural high frequency hearing loss with fluid behind her eardrum 

We've been through a few other hearing tests but none she understood what to do. She's already been through one set of ear tubes. This last test showed fluid behind her eardrums and mild to moderate hearing loss with nerve damage. She is scheduled to get another set of tubes and adnoids removed to see if it helps the fluid than set up to get hearing aids. 

Now my questions are.
She wears glasses with a band to it [zenni children's flexible glasses] should I look for a band to keep her glasses/hearing Aids together and clipped to her shirt? 

What will they supply you with once you get the hearing aids back from being custom made [if anything?]

Anything that will be good to have on hand for her/make things easier for us.

I've seen some hats with mesh sides. Is that just needed for CI implants or helpefull for hearing aids as well?

Also of course any other hints/tips you can give me for a 4 year old rambunctious daredevil child who's not afraid of much 🤣

Thank you all!

I’m a HOH guy, but also a dad, so I understand what shenanigans kiddos can get into. I haven’t looked for your specific needs, but you should bookmark this site: https://www.diglo.com

Edit: https://www.diglo.com/hearing-aids-and-accessories/clips-and-protectors;d=1;c=11;s=115

We bought bands that clip to their shirt until our child was in like... 2-3rd grade? They have lots of cute ones on Etsy.

My 4 year old has had his hearing aids since 6 months old and started wearing glasses last year. I was concerned about both at first but it’s been very smooth. No special equipment necessary. 

He wore pilot caps when little but hasn’t needed anything retention wise since before he was 2. I wouldn’t suggest investing in anything like that until you see what your daughter might prefer or need. 

Our audiologist provided us with cleaning supplies and any equipment we might have needed. I’ve replaced a few things since then but again it’ll come down to personal preference and you won’t know until you are in it.

Hearing aid headbands (can find on Etsy) are really helpful if she’s in sports, or just prefers headbands over the retention wires. I recommend getting at least one retention wire and using it until you can be sure that they will stay in and that she will not mess with her HAs. I have had HAs since about her age, so if you have any other questions feel free to reach out

My kiddo got her aids just after turning 5, almost exactly 2 years ago.

Aids will come with a charger (unless you did battery ones) and a cleaning brush, not much else.

Highly suggest picking up a little dryer on Amazon - has saved us when she goes in the shower and doesn't figure out she has them on for a bit.

We have her wear regular hats and everything else. We haven't needed retaining clips of any sort, they stay in so well. She rode them today at an amusement park just fine for everything but the 60+mph coaster. 

I also got cute little pouches for her that are keychains to put her aids in

Nail stickers for decorations work great - they have custom skins but my kid never found a pattern she loves and she loves her pink aids. So the characters don't make her lose that but give some customization.

We also have jewelry and charms for her aids. We have some from Deafmetal and some, weirdly, from a shop at our local Ren faire.

My kiddo isn't a glasses wearer so no answers on that though.",2025-04-26 19:00:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k8kfiw/4_year_old_hoh/

Hey I am hard of hearing (have to use a cochlear implant and hearing aid) but all of my ADHD and autistic friends have the same adjustments as me. Things like we all need subtitles when watching tv, need low noise and low distraction places to socialize in, needing people to be in front of us to be able to understand them etc. So functionally it's the same problem (not processing what's being said) but for different reasons (me having a degenerative inner ear disorder, my friends having different auditory attention and sensory processing). If your hearing is fine, then maybe it's an auditory or sensory processing issue for you?

Trust your audiologist. While the audiogram isn't perfect, it's extremely good at identifying when there *isn't* a hearing loss - the false negative rate is extremely low

That doesn't mean you hear perfectly well, it just means the problem isn't in your ear's hardware. You could have an audio processing disorder or attention-related issue.

r/audiprocdisorder

Not diagnosing you but this is often the case for those with auditory processing disorder (APD). This is a neurological condition like ADHD, dyslexia or autism, not a physical hearing problem. I have the same issues you do and I have APD.

It may also be due to something like ADHD where you struggle with focusing/attention if you have other ADHD symptoms.

You need to press the button for faint noises so don't worry about that, the audiologists always tell me. Maybe you have a processing issue not hearing loss?

Yep your hearing is within normal range",2025-04-26 06:07:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k8663f/hmmm_supposedly_my_hearing_is_normal_i_dont_have/

Where I work, we have people assigned to scope out the floors and make sure they're empty.

That being said, when I was a temp and didn't have the means to get hearing aids that were compatible with the phones, I had to take my hearing aids out. I didn't hear the test alarms going off and a friend tried to yank me out. I was busy listening to messages and waved her off. After I hung up, I realized the floor was empty. I jokingly scolded everyone - except the one person - for leaving me up there to die.

Your work should have accessible fire/emergency alarms. In theory, you can ask HR for that accommodation and/or your shift supervisor notify you in person in case of emergency. In reality, someone will probably grab you on the way out.

At my new job, most people on that floor work in a separate office. Down a long hallway. One day while working the fire alarm located in the hall went off. Everyone left. It wasn’t until they were outside and counting everyone did they discover that me, the Deaf guy, wasn’t there. Someone had go back up to get me. The next day the facilities workers installed a flashing alarm in my office. Fortunately, it was a minor fire contained on a different floor. No one, including myself, thought about that I can’t see the flashing fire alarm in the hall from my office.",2025-04-25 12:54:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k7k7sk/buddy_system_in_an_emergency/
1k6x9pi,hardofhearing,Signs of *gradual* hearing lost,"How could you realize you have mild to moderate gradual hearing loss? Is there an event to prompt you to get a hearing test?

I have a family member who became hard of hearing: one ear gradually, another ear suddenly. They told me how it's not difficult to realize one ear could not hear suddenly. The gradual hearing loss was harder to detect: They really did not know when it started to get weaker when the other ear was normal. Indeed, they did not know what they could not hear.

My key moment was realizing how often I was quitting media without subtitles because I couldn't follow along.

I’ve been gradually losing my hearing since birth, started wearing hearing aids at 10. Once every 5 years or so it gets to the point where I can no longer understand what people are saying, so I get retested.

You’d think I would notice the loss sooner but it’s crazy how long it takes me to realize I’m at that point. Our brains are really good at filling in the blanks, so long *as it’s getting enough context.* 

At one visit to the audiologist, he pointed out that I couldn’t “hear” him if he spoke facing away from me. Basically I read lips, but not fluently. I still need to some sound and my brain will use lip shapes to fill in the blanks. I think that’s why HOH people tend to get exhausted during conversations; our brains have to work harder.

On a similar note to your post, I finally had that moment where realized that I am effectively deaf without my hearing aids :( I can no longer hear the sink running or even hear the toilet flush. After realizing that, I noticed other things I couldn’t hear either. It’s weird. I’m constantly checking my phone to make sure I’m not blasting music and videos unknowingly (it’s happened in public 😳) At the same time it’s peaceful whenever I don’t *want* to hear, so there’s that 😉

I noticed, but you don't think it's a possibility in your twenties, so you chalk it up to wax, or people mumbling. 

I personally didn't pay attention until the pandemic. I watch lips and faces and was filling in the blanks quite a bit with context. Or I thought I was. I probably misheard a ton. 

When the masks went on, I suddenly had no idea what anyone was saying to me and realized there might be a problem.

It's easy to mishear with mild loss and you often still have a few coping mechanisms that help... I needed my coping mechanism removed (ability to see faces) before I really understood there was a problem.

I knew when my daughter came home from her first year of college and I couldn’t understand half of what she said. Literally, not because she’d picked up a new accent or something.

I had no idea until my I met my wife. After a few years, she told me to get my hearing checked.

For me it was just the difference of being able to hear things again but if someone had brought my attention to my hearing loss I might have noticed sooner. I couldn’t hear birds, wind in the trees, fabric makes noise when you touch it (especially jeans with nails), pencil and paper makes a beautiful noise too. I was always saying what because I couldn’t hear all of the words. I always had subtitles on and when I turned the tv down to whisper level I asked my husband how loud it was to him and got a shock on how loud it was. There are a lot of little things. But it being gradual it’s similar to getting glasses prescription updated and realizing how old your last prescription was.

I realized I couldn't hear things other people around me could hear. I couldn't hear the TV when watching with friends. I was 21 but for all I know it started earlier and I didn't notice.

- I asked people to talk clearer, not louder.
- I started using CC more when watching tv.
- I started asking “what?” noticeably more.
- I was on a dance floor and suddenly needed to get away from people all around me. So I gravitated to a place with fewer people. I didn’t understand why more people weren’t there. Then looked up and saw one of the PA loudspeakers and realized it didn’t seem especially loud.
- I stopped going to large gatherings because I figured, what’s the point?
- When I started sitting or walking close to the speaker when going on walking tours or lectures, I made an appointment with an ENT -&gt; referred to Audi -&gt; recommended hearing aids.  I asked how much and was told what the cost was. First thought: FML

Happy ending:

- A relative gave me his “second spare pair” of hearing aids.
- I learned a lot about SNHL and hearing aids. 
- I got insurance with HA coverage.
- Currently trialing the latest and greatest.

Dealing w/ progressive hearing loss,

Id say...  it's more like moments when talking to other people 
 while out, where they will mention something random.. like "". There is a parrot singing right now, how beautiful!   ''. 
And I was like ..
 ""????"" and then realized that I cpuldnt  hear it anymore . .




But, there were .. also moments where I was like "" ... what's that sound?..."" 
and my sister was w like ""ah, it's the.. the ambulance sirens.. "". i felt like it made a different sound before  .. in my head




I'm also hearing aid  user,....  so I would get moments like wait, 
This is a completely new sound for me.... what is it?"" especially when I buy new ones tat are much more  powerful or advanced...

A friend’s SO was in the backseat of my sedan. Previously I’d been able to hear people sitting in the backseat, he spoke twice before my friend in the passenger seat realized I had no idea he’d spoken.

Same situation with my uncle. He worked in construction for decades and didn't realize how much he was losing his hearing until it became a bigger issue. That gradual stuff is tough to catch because you just adapt, right? He eventually got hearing aids from audien and he was shocked at how much he'd been missing out on. If you're noticing things like having to turn the TV volume up louder or not hearing people from another room, it could be a sign. A hearing test can't hurt and if hearing aids are needed, they can make a huge difference.

I’ve been completely deaf in one ear since I was 5 years old but I’ve been noticing that my right ear is gradually losing its ability to capture sound. I didn’t really notice it until like someone said Covid. I rely on reading lips and asking people to speak clearer for me and started becoming a pro at somewhat understanding what people are saying to me. (Not all the time, for reasons like people mumbling, accents, speaking too fast etc.). However, when Covid came around and people started wearing masks I was helpless. Literally couldn’t understand a word of what people were saying. Even when asked to speak clearer. I figured I never really realized that I’m gradually losing my hearing abilities in my right ear because I was always reading lips. I’d say my hearing in my right ear is roughly 60/40. I still hear things, it’s just muddled (I do wear a kick ass hearing aid though!!) and I’m suspected to completely lose my hearing much sooner than later. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, seeing that I’m only 27 and my career in EMS might be coming to a close.",2025-04-24 16:56:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k6x9pi/signs_of_gradual_hearing_lost/

Most smart TVs and streaming devices have dialogue enhancement features that can help a little. Consider a soundbar, too.

If you have a smart tv, it probably has Bluetooth, and you could use Bluetooth headphones with it. If you don’t have a smart tv, there are Bluetooth devices that can attach to regular tvs that put out a Bluetooth signal for you to use Bluetooth headphones.

(For honesty purposes, that is a family member’s eBay store, but I genuinely think this could help your situation)

Edit: Just wanted to add that if you have Bluetooth hearing aids, this device probably won’t work with them. Most hearing aid companies have their own specific Bluetooth streaming devices.

Check out ClearCast. Put the TV at a volume comfortable for her and You can put the remote mic next to the Tv and the sound will route into your earbuds.

I use bluetooth headphones. My TV will also play audio from the speakers. It looks like yours doesn't but maybe you could get another one or perhaps your daughter could put in ear plugs whilst you have it up loud.

I have hearing aids too with a TV setting that makes the audio clearer that helps as well.

Do you have hearing aids?

1k6r29y,hardofhearing,Help with hearing test results,"I'm filing with VA disability and I'm trying to get a better understanding of my results. I've found some answers for the first picture. The second picture (I'm assuming) is speech recognition?

Hi OP!

You are correct in assuming it is for speech recognition. It tests your ability to understand speech at different volumes of loudness as well as your ability to distinguish between certain sounds. 

From what it looks like, you have more loss in the higher frequencies which means you will likely have a harder time hearing or distinguishing between softer sounds such as ph, f, th, s, etc. With this type of hearing loss, it’s the clarity of speech that is affected.",2025-04-24 12:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k6r29y/help_with_hearing_test_results/
1k6k9i9,hardofhearing,Just found out I’m hard of hearing,"I need to vent this. When I was in middle school, when we did the spine and hearing test I remember being sent to the doctors for additional hearing tests. I’m going to attempt to make this as short as possible.

 I have a sociopath for a biological mother. Which isn’t something I say out of spite, but she’s actually a sociopath. She previously hid that I had asthma that also got diagnosed in middle school, but I found out in my mid 20s. She watched me struggle with that and said nothing. Anytime I was hospitalized for it she convinced doctors I was fine/it was anxiety. I found out by accidentally going to the same clinic I went to in middle school (for something else)and they asked how my asthma was. 

When I became an adult I purposely avoided all doctors my bio mother previously talked to because of the asthma situation and others like it. Long story short, I ended up with a crazy amount of diagnoses that should have been diagnosed in childhood and a crazy long medication list because I wasn’t treated sooner. Anyway, I forgot about the hearing test until I had to get my baby checked for his hearing test. He passed however he had to retest again later, due to my partner’s family having history of hearing loss. Second test my son shows possible hearing loss in one of his ears and we have to recheck another time to confirm severity because he’s a baby and they lost his attention towards the end. His audiologist recommends my husband and I do one just to be sure. I did mine today and found out I have mild sensorineural hearing loss in my left ear. 

Leaving the doctors I was fine because I previously learned ASL and was like ok they said I’m not to the extent of a hearing aid quite yet but I need to have another check up in a year/routinely. That if for some reason I’m not hearing my kids fully that it would be a good idea to consider it. However when I realized that the majority of the fights my partner and I have ever had started because of what I thought he said vs what he actually said. Or getting mad and repeating myself because I didn’t think he answered, I started crying. We also realized majority of the time he stands on my hearing loss side due to the layout of our apartment and where I like to sit. He just smiled and said it’s ok we can work on facing each other from now on and he can learn ASL if it helps. 
My bio mother told me when they told us for results that I have selective hearing and not to be dramatic. I was gaslit into believing it. There were so many instances that this has caused problems from not knowing this. I feel overwhelmingly angry and frustrated. 

Does anyone else had this type of hearing loss? Did it get worse? Were you to the extent of not needing a hearing aid then later having to get one? What should I be doing? All I was given was a list of sentence to tell people I’m hard of hearing and how best to help me.

Firstly, with sensorineural losses it's often not known what the direct cause is or if it's getting worse, but your audiologist would be the best person to answer.

Also I'm sorry you just found out, I was hh from birth and didn't get hearing aids until I was 16 because my parents didn't think they were necessary. They literally dismissed it as not an issue when my school audiologists were saying it was an issue. If your child has a hearing loss make sure they get the appropriate resources and don't tell through the cracks like I did. Maybe teach them some ASL and also see what your audiologist recfomends (kids can acquire signed language before voiced too!)


To add onto the ASL comment, ASL also helps everyone I think. My hearing loss is less than most Deaf people I know but I'm still Deaf. It still benefits me greatly. 

Anyways I'm not the best at constructing responses in English as most of my socialisation now is entirely in ASL, so hopefully my response made sense.

I’m so glad you have a partner who is inclined to be supportive. That’s *huge* for you, and would be even without the issues with your mother. 

It took me a long, long time to understand that how my mother treated me said more about her than about me. Unfortunately, it’s hard to get past the complications that arise because of situations like yours and mine. You will absolutely have times when all of that leads to big, messy emotions, so I hope you work with that fabulous partner of yours to create a system of communication and support that helps all of you manage it. Be sure to offer yourself and him lots of grace along the way. 

I think I’ve always had some mild hearing loss that went undetected, not from neglect or denial, but just wasn’t picked up on. It’s now progressed to moderate hearing loss, but that doesn’t mean yours will. We’re all different. I *can* say that it’s a lot easier today to deal with than even 10 years ago — hearing aids keep getting better, subtitles are better, and more places can offer some accommodations. I did jury duty last week and the assistive hearing system was fantastic. 

Thanks for sharing with us, and good luck with all of it.",2025-04-24 05:09:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k6k9i9/just_found_out_im_hard_of_hearing/

I’m suffering from social anxiety, and having hard of hearing hasn’t really done me any better.. I always feel so lonely bcuz no one understands, and most people get so mad at me for not hearing what they say- which has made me socialize less.

I know I should wear my hearing aids but… it doesn’t really help, I just feel worse about myself when those can’t even help me capture what people say.

My family has no sympathy for me having worse hearing than them, I’m born with it- so it isn’t really new. But they always forget, I have to remind them at least once a day, bcuz they get so annoyed at me not hearing them or answering to whatever they ask.

Anyways I just feel so lonely, and like I’m meant to be lonely. I’ve began to tell people from the start when I get to know someone that I have HOH, and that I understand if they can’t handle it, bcuz I’m used to people getting mad..

I just wanted to tell someone that might understand.

I always tell people they are ""hearing aids"" and not ""understanding aids"".  In other words, I can hear you mumbling louder but they do not fix your annunciation issues.

I get you. I feel this. My situation is a lot like yours. 

It depends on your type of loss, but for me (ski slope), hearing aids only kind of work. They're not designed for that kind of loss. I kept trying to wear them for years before an audiologist finally told me it was COMMON for people like me to find them unhelpful. That's when I realized how much guilt I had wrapped up in this, like it's my fault and my problem to solve and I'm a drain on the people around me for needing help. 

From what you wrote I don't think it will be an overnight thing for you to believe this, but: you are not a problem. Your hearing may be bad, but you do deserve a normal life, and you can surround yourself with people who will make you forget you even have hearing loss.

You don’t need to wear your HAs. They’re made to make your life easier. Hearing people take advantage of that.

Hearing aids are treated by the non hard of hearing as a perfect cure all solution to hearing loss. Lots of people incorrectly assume that if you wear them you’ll be just as able to hear as anyone else. This is false. 

I was also born with hearing loss into a family that especially used to pester me about not wearing them enough. I’ve gotten them to back off about it as I’ve gotten older and have been able to better articulate that hearing aids don’t help. In my case I’ve got one ear that’s hard of hearing, so I’ve been able to convince them to sit or stand on my good side to be heard, but they don’t always remember or care.

There is nothing wrong with not wearing your hearing aids if they don’t help you. And aid that fails to help isn’t fulfilling its purpose. You don’t owe it to anyone to wear something that doesn’t make your life easier.

You also don’t have to apologize to others for being hard of hearing. I’ve found people roll with it best when you simply say it’s a part of you and they’ll need to speak up on occasion. I’m not sure if it’s just where I am but people outside my family are often a lot more accommodating than those in it. 

It’s a fact of your life, if people get angry at you for this then that shows what sort of person they are. They don’t deserve to have you around if they can’t handle it. You’re not a worse person or more annoying because of this. You deserve friendship and a full life regardless of how much or how little you can hear. I hope you can find friends and community who understand that.

I’ve not done it myself, but if you wanted to try and find community there may be groups of hard of hearing or deaf people in your area that might be more welcoming. It’s worth looking if you want to.

It's possible your hearing aids don't work well because they are programmed poorly. Poor audiology practice is rampant... It might not be your fault they don't work well for you

I feel like you ..I have genetic bilateral hearing loss. Im supposed to wear aids all the time, but usually just do when I try to socialize. And what's up with people being inconvenienced because I can't hear. Like I'd love to be able to set aside my hearing loss to make your life easier. Ugh!  ❤️

I am almost 50, and I can tell you the loneliness will not go away. I get tired easily with hearing aids, as it still a sensory stimulation. 
But also understood that I have to grow and change my perspective, be less dependent on family. Relationships are about the exchange, frustration is never a good base. But you have to search yours.
I also noticed that when I am in stressful situations or around the people i don't lake and get stressed, my hearing switches off completely. Something similar to when you skipping parts while reading.

Life is a journey and adventure. Don't be stuck in a swamp and don't be controlled by unhappiness of others. Learn other ways of communication, learn more about yourself and the ways to get the happiness sparkles every day. If you are HOH then you are. Find out what you can do and what you can't. Then the HOW to do the 'can't' in an easy way for others. People don't like hassle. And you don't like mad people. Avoidance does not solve the problem, then make it a game. Just find your own way to jump over the obstacles.

Hi! I have severe hearing loss and use hearing aids, but they don’t help me much too. I’ll tell you one thing: being HoH is a challenge, but it’s also like a filter. It brought the right people into my life. In a way, having a disability pushed selfish people away. So I have a few, but very special friends who truly care about me. Also, one of the reasons I fell in love with my husband is because he’s so supportive and fully embraced who I am.

I believe it’s very important to accept and love yourself so you can take up your space in the world. There will always be barriers, but with support, you can still live a happy life despite them.

I feel like having similar issues. Feel free to speak if you want.

Tell your family that you deal with dicks/a#holes/beyotches/SuitableEpithetHere outside, and its bad enough that you have to deal with them within the family, and that you deal with it every day,but they only deal with it when being mean to the hard of hearing. 
Don't be afraid to assert yourself. (63 years experience with about 15% hearing of dealing with ppl like that).

I LOVE MY HEARING AIDS! 
I tell ppl I’m HOH, show the how cute they are and move on.

You don't say if you know ASL but you might consider learning it if you haven't already.  It is by far the most popular visual communication system in the US.  Learning ASL won't help a lick with your family and friends but it opens up a new world of opportunity for you.

Why do you hate wearing hearing aids? Is it due to a design problem causing uncomfortable sensations in the ear?

When someone gets annoyed/impatient with me when I don't hear them, my standard response is ""I'm sorry if my being hard of hearing is inconvenient for you "". If that does shut them up, the hell with them. Those are not the people you need in your life. Stay open to people who know how to be accepting and supportive.

Instead of being sympathetic, people get frustrated, mad and tend to not speak to you. I've given people printouts of how to speak to the HOH and they try to follow it but forget it after awhile.

My world is full of sounds, I hear birds that others don't hear, breezes, etc. But everybody sounds like Daffy Duck, or Daisy Duck. Music all sounds like Daffy and the Chipmunks accompanied by a Chinese opera orchestra playing out of tune. I asked one person if it's easier to understand Daffy if he speaks louder and she replied, ""He's always loud - it doesn't help, he has to speak slower and enunciate better"". Exactly!

Sometimes apologizing for my disability helps, but only temporarily, and making them feel guilty is not a good idea if you really want to engage them.

Don't let it discourage you. Don't isolate yourself. Keep engaging, one way or another. There are 50 million HOH in the US alone, so you are not alone....

Hey. I’m born with conductive hearing loss in both ears. I found noisy situations difficult for me. Like it sounds like I hear gibberish and conversations flow really fast, making it hard to keep track. Despite wearing hearing aids. People overreacting or getting mad at you is not your problem to carry. It’s theirs. Period. You deserve a social life as much as anyone else. 

That said, I’ve been working on some diagrams and analogies recently to help track and make sense of my experiences over time. I’m building a website to organize everything. A prototype is in the works. I would say the analogy essentially remaps the hearing system and strips out technical jargon in exchange for everyday terms I believe the average person understands. I don’t feel like spoiling the surprise by “spilling the tea” but I feel proud and excited. I can dm you when the prototype is ready.

It’s your choice, 100%, but I highly encourage you to consider wearing them. https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/s/rVVdugNGvM

I promise you that there is another person who can relate to you and will want to be friends, you just have to give it time and to keep living life. I met another woman who's just like me, we're both deaf but can speak to one another, we exchanged numbers at the dog-park but have not met up for coffee yet, it may not lead to a fully fledged friendship but its better than nothing.

The only time I wear my hearing aids are when I'm expecting to be speaking to, or having conversation with others e.g. doctor's appointment, job interview etc ... Otherwise, I don't ever really wear them, when maybe perhaps I should

I don't ever expect anyone to speak to me, at least for more than a few words, so whenever some random person attempts to speak to me (at the bus stop, standing in queue in the shops, leafleters flagging me down etc...) I always get caught off guard. I genuinely never expect people to speak to me, and do tend to get fairly flustered/slightly panicked, and never know what to say

For those who have hearing difficulties, and have experienced situations like these, how do you personally handle it? What do you do?

[댓글]
I go “full deaf.” Point to ear, shake head. If the person is persistent, I assume it must be important information, and pull out my phone to open a note and let them type. 

If you voice, at all, people assume you can hear them. It immediately becomes harder to get them to accommodate you. Although my deaf accent is very mild, I try to go “voice off” in a situation where I think people will try to talk to me and I won’t be able to hear them. 

I do use ASL and have the amazing gift of a spouse who went to college for ASL-English interpretation. When I’m not with my spouse, I use caption apps if a longer conversation is necessary. NALscribe is a fantastic free app if you want something low-cost!

Practice going voice off. Like another commenter said, if you talk they assume you can hear enough and put all the work to communicate on you. It feels wrong when you first go voice off if you're not used to it, but think of it this way. You deserve a hearing break, and why do you owe strangers all that mental puzzle work for something usually trivial? You don't. Find someone else to help you get your cereal today. I don't work here lol

And most people when I shake my head and point to my ear (or sign ""deaf"") just go wide eyed and leave me in the dust lol Couldn't have been that important huh?

It depends on the situation.  I have a cochlear implant and wear it almost all the time.  Sometimes though, I just want to be my natural self and not deal with the overhead of interpreting sound.  This will usually be at home.  I'll read for an hour or two.  I tell my family ahead of time that I'm ""going deaf"" and they won't bother me unless it's something important.  We do have the occasional ""why aren't you wearing your CI"" argument.  And, to be fair, I do sometimes dramatically take the CI off mid-argument when my wife pisses me off which is unfair.

I almost always wear the CI when I'm out.  If I'm out and my implant isn't working, dead battery or I've been sweating too much, I avoid communication as much as I can.  If someone starts a conversation with me, I'll tell them I'm deaf.  I used to say ""hard of hearing"" or ""I don't hear very well"" but that doesn't get the point across.  Everyone knows someone that doesn't hear very well that they can still communicate with.  Most people don't know someone with as profound a hearing loss as mine.  The word ""deaf"" makes people understand better.  I don't particularly care if they don't understand how I can be deaf and be able to talk.  I don't want to get into my life story.  I keep interactions short but polite.  If it is important (it usually isn't), I'll lip read and work with the limited hearing I do have.

I use my hearing aids' bluetooth to listen to those things, so depending on the settings I either have to pause what I'm listening to in order to hear the person, or turn it down. If the batteries are dead, (the only time is he in that situation) I can usually hear the person of they speak a bit louder and don't mumble. I'm on Android and I also love the LiveTranscribe app. I've used that in noisy situations.

I highly encourage you to wear them. See the links in this comment. https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/s/rVVdugNGvM

I always wear my hearing aids when out and about.

Also you should definitely wear your hearing aids as much as possible. My audiologist explained to me that your processing gets worse if you need hearing aids and don't wear them because your brain essentially gives up on hearing to get information and stops putting energy into maintaining the neurons for processing sound into language. So you become like me where things have to be something like 70 dB for me to comfortably understand them even though my hearing threshold is much lower.

This is a little different, but I've had times at work where there is a zero percent chance I'm going to understand someone even with my hearing aids if they speak to me normally. What I do is loudly state ""I can't hear you, can you come closer?"" and point directly to my ear and present it towards them. My coworkers know to then speak right in my ear. There's a particular spot my hearing aids pick up really well, I think it must be the ""phone"" distance. I also make calls over the radio if I'm about to do something where I won't be able to hear, and if I have to take my hearing aids off bc of weather I tell my manager just in case shit hits the fan and someone needs to come get me. But I generally can hear enough to know something is coming from my radio and can then hold it close enough to my head to get info or ask to repeat. 

I did briefly have a coworker who there was absolutely no hope of me understanding 3/4 of what he said. He had a slight lisp and spoke softly naturally, and also my hearing is the worst at the range his voice was in. I was pondering what to do because it was becoming frustrating, and I was worried we would miscommunicate about something important as my job can be dangerous. But he washed out so it became a non-issue lol.

With members of the general public if I really can't figure it out, I'll say I can't hear them, I'm hard of hearing, can they show me what they mean? And that usually gets enough information for my brain to process what they said.

I get this a lot as often my work can be very solitary and so often I walk out if home with earbuds in and forget to bring my hearing aids - they’re exhausting and its unlikely I really need them that day etc.

I cant really bluff my through a conversation anymore without it clearly being weird/inaccurate, but also come across as ‘hearing enough’ that even if I tell people they think its very mild rather than profound and nuanced.

I just as charismatically as I can act as if they’ve caught me offguard and say “hello! Sorry, Im actually really deaf and dont have my hearing aids on me” (to save myself arduous conversation I might even lie and say they broken/being fixed) “I might need you to slow down / can I help you / what did you ask me?”

And typically when I talk to people I minorly conceal how much im lip reading or face watching - but I make no such guises here. Eyes crosshair to lip patterns and I lean in and frown in clear focus.

It just saves me a lot of very similar, very uninformed, very repetitive yet totally sincere conversations with random people.

I got my NHS hearing aids upgraded around two years ago and I now have Bluetooth Phonak Nathos Nova Ms. They connect direct to my phone and I can listen to music, videos etc. they also connect to my Phonak Roger microphones for work. If I’m listening to something I simply pause it and can hear whatever is being said. Re-engage with your audiology clinic. Do you attend the clinic to have your tubing, molds or domes etc changed? Ask when you are due a review. Your hearing loss won’t stay the same forever. Well, mine definitely hasn’t. You’ll possibly be due a review if you ask and possibly an upgrade.

I just point to my ears and shake head and if that doesn’t quite get the point across I use actual sign and say pretty much anything till they do get it and if they keep going i pull out my phone to get them to type it

Keep an eye on your mirrors. If you have large blindspots, I recommend a blindspot mirror.

I’m trialing a pair of phonak BTE hearing aids and I am not a fan of the in the ear piece/microphone (sorry I’m not sure what it’s called) and I’ve been doing some research and I feel like I would prefer an earmould style but when I research it seems like those are more often used for severe-profound hearing loss. It’s kind of hard to get in contact with the audiologist besides appointment so that’s why I came here for advice. Is it possible to get earmoulds or no? And is there a certain type of earmould that people like more or is it all very specific to the individual?


[댓글]
I got earmolds because I wanted them. I had to pay for them to be made, but I was willing because I wasn't tolerating the domes well.

Ultimately I don't think they are going to tell you no if you are willing to pay for them. It's worth asking at any rate.

There are several different styles of ""domes"" (the rubber tip on the part that goes into your ear). I'm about a week into my first set of hearing aides and trying out a third style/size of domes. 

I would bet audiologists have samples in their office you could try, but you can also order them on Amazon. The best I can tell they're all pretty much interchangeable so get whichever brand looks good to you. I found the small domes in the set that I got first were just a tad too small, but the mediums were too big. I was able to look up their actual sizes (7mm&amp;9mm) and found a brand that has a size that's 8mm. So far they seem to be the best fit so far... But it takes me a day or two to really try them out and know if I can tolerate them. 

One ""downside"" to the ear molds is that they're much more visible. With the BTE HA I have, you really can't tell I'm wearing them unless you stand directly behind me and make a point of looking behind my ears. Even my husband today saw me watching a video on my phone and asked why I didn't have the sound on. When I told him I was listening through Bluetooth he looked super confused and asked ""how???"" Even sitting right next to me, looking at my ears, and knowing that I wear hearing aides, he didn't see them😳. 

That said, that's obviously not something that would bother some. I personally don't really give a hoot if people can see them. But it is nice that they're so discreet. It keeps my toddler from trying to dig them out of my ears at least🤣🤷.

I’m from the UK and you can have ear moulds if your HoH or d/Deaf too :) I’ve always had ear moulds, so I don’t know what the other types feel like, but for me moulds sit comfortably in the ear :)

I had slim tubing and domes for around 12 years. My hearing aids were upgraded again 2 years ago. I was getting domes again but the Team Leader stipulated that I needed ear moulds due to my level of hearing loss (moderately severe). she instructed my audiologist accordingly. That meant switching again to another model of hearing aid that could accommodate the wider tubing required for the ear moulds. You have been fitted with open ear slim tubes and domes. Those domes come in different sizes. You are surely due back for a review to see how you’re adapting? Especially if these are your first hearing aids. Phone up or ask your GP to re-refer you. 
I’m on HA pair number 4 now, currently Phonak Nathos Nova Ms. For work I have a variety of Phonak accessories/microphones I got via Access to Work. The My Phonak app has been a big help for me.

I tried molds and had a significant amount of occlusion.  So they didn’t work.  That’s why they are more appropriate for profound loss. Ended up with a Widex RIC with open domes.  Love them.",2025-04-22 00:01:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k4smh9/first_pair_of_hearing_aids/

Me not realizing that anyone else could hear what I was listening to apologized profusely turned the volume down... Meanwhile earlier today I was listening to Lights Out..  IYKYK... Then I died allover again ☠️

And that’s why I have molds.

The worst possible time for Bluetooth to decide “nah, I’m not gonna connect this time”

Mine thankfully haven't done that YET. But I always get the weirdest looks when I answer a phone call and they are connected. My sister in law asked if I had an ear piece in because she couldn't see my hearing aides 🤣

same here! i have the canal moulds and i didnt know anyone could hear me. my partner has been singing along to tik tok tunes while ive been on and it was an eye opener!

Do not ask for a lot of power (volume) for the first time. 
 
Allow yourself to adjust to lower volume then when you're used to having the aids for a few weeks and you want more, you can get adjustments made. 

I have worn hearings for over 30 years and I remember switching from analog to digital and I asked for way too much power and my head turned into an echo chamber, I refused to wear them until I got less power. 

It might be overwhelming to hear some noises at first but you will get used to it. You can always turn the aids off for a sound you don't like. 

I do that when I'm vacuuming, using a blender, or using a power washer.

1. be honest. if its too loud or quiet say so. 2. wear them as much as you can but not so much your overwhelmed/dizzy as a result/have a headache. 3. TAKE BREAKS. 4. for me background noise is a lot more on par with other noise even if its quiet. some noises are on similar sound levels compared to before and that makes it hard to hear with multiple people talking or things going on. 5. Make sure the earpiece is in your ear securely. that will help with making sure the sound is appropriate and minimise feedback. 6. ask any questions you have don't be shy. If your struggling say so. 7. Go slow. ask for the ability to change the volume yourself. it helps a lot when your not used to it yet and with mine it beeps twice when your at the default level.  
I'm really new to this myself. about 5-6 days in so I cant help much but this is what I noticed.

Find out what your clinics trouble shooting guides are. For example my clinics does walk ins every Monday from 1pm to 2pm. I don't have to wait for an appointment to get help or replacement parts if they have them on hand. You likely will get a service plan or opportunity to acquire one- a great way to repair or replace devices.

Take someone with you to have conversations with, if you can. Maybe it's changed in the last few years but whenever I got hearing aids as a kid, the audiologist would always ask me how the hearing aids sounded. And I'd be like, *they sound fine in this soundproofed room where nobody is speaking?*

Now I'm an adult, I'd take someone with me to talk to, get them to face away from me, maybe listen to a call on my phone, have it make noises while someone speaks, etc. Real life situations where you'll need your hearing aids the most.

Avoid restaurants for a little bit until your use to them.

Pay attention to all the settings and ask questions. Take notes. Make sure you know how to clean, change wax plugs (if applicable) and batteries.

adding, if there is an app make sure you have downloaded it but wait to see if the audiologist will help you with that

I have a severe hearing loss. I have a speech in noise program that helps me a lot. I had my AuD tweak the program to be two notches lower than the rest (can always turn it up if I need but that rarely happens). I also had her do an extreme forward focus of the microphones to help block out unwanted noise. This means I have to look at whoever is talking. I like that kind of focus.

I rarely hear speech on planes. The jet engines drown out speech for me. Two things. If you check luggage, tell the the counter person you are hearing impaired. You should get ""pre-board"" status. I also wear a sunflower lanyard in airports to let others know I have an invisible disability. That thing is freaking magic. I get through TSA and everything much easier.

It takes a few weeks for your brain to filter out noises that it’s not used to.  So don’t give up if they start out causing anxiety or annoyance.  I was surprised how much I missed.  Also, they will itch when you first put them in and then you won’t feel them.  

Most importantly: enjoy the ability to live your life fully.  It’s amazing to be able to hear what others are saying.  Wishing you all the best on your hearing aid journey!!

These are all very helpful!!

Be aware you’ll hear sounds you’ve not heard in a long time. I hadn’t heard myself pee for years. I carried a can of WD40 and was oiling squeaky hinges. I had no idea my office was so noisy. 😂

You are there for your hearing so be honest if the fit is not right. Keep telling them to improve the sound. From my experience it took many sessions for the Audiologist to get it right, but when they did......O\_O. I'm happy for you that you are getting your hearing back.",2025-04-21 17:33:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1k4jc1g/getting_my_hearing_aids_fitted_tomorrowtips/

1k0x2c0,hardofhearing,Hearing Aid Question,"Is there a good brand/ make and model for noise induced hearing loss ? From 2015 to 2019 I attended a little under 200 heavy metal concerts, many of which I spent the whole show in the front row. I wore 32 dbr foam earplugs every time, no tinnitus thank god.

I am having trouble with conversations on the phone however, its not possible to carry my headset everywhere I go. I also have trouble when there is background noise, such as a conversation in a crowded restaurant. 

I visited a hearing doctor who confirmed noise induced hearing loss, I forget the statistics though. Perhaps this isn't the right sub I'm sorry.

Again any recommendations for a make and model ? I'd prefer a hearing aid that's not as visible to others.

Thank you in advance for any replies.

[댓글]
I would consult or get a referral to an audiologist. They will be able to provide you all the information about which hearing aid would best suit your needs. 

It would be ill-advised for any of us on the internet to suggest a hearing aid or a brand without knowing the severity and nature of your hearing loss. 

As far as hearing aids that aren’t visible to others, there are multiple available. See [this link](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/in-depth/hearing-aids/art-20044116) to the Mayo Clinic website for a detailed breakdown.

I thought I'd share, my uncle developed moderate hearing loss after working in construction for years. He's now using audien ion pro, which is super low-key and very reasonably priced. They already come with bluetooth so he can take calls and stream audio directly from his phone. Might be a good option to check out.

Idk if this is specific to noise induced but oticons have been great for me!

200! How crazy. You were right to use plugs…!

Is your hearing loss mild? I've got mild noise-induced loss from years of shows too and now phone calls + crowded restaurants are rough. I use audien atom pro 2, they sit inside my ears so nobody notices them and the battery runs all day.

1jxyagc,hardofhearing,Any thoughts of the studies linking hearing loss to dementia/Alzheimer's in older adults online??,"Recently I saw on IG and Google, several articles linking hearing loss in older adults to dementia/Alzheimer's and wanted to get a discussion on this here.

I ask because I'm 60 and I have mixed feelings about my long term care, getting new hearing aids and mentioning this to my doctor. And there is an hereditary pattern of dementia/Alzheimer's in my family tree. 

Given that I've worn hearing aids since I was three years old, I want to go silent (no aids) in my later years (retirement) if possible. But I don't think it will be possible.

I have a new age/herbal neighbor that is pushing me to take cognitive supplements and such. I didn't say anything about this study. They just mentioned to take it for a healthy lifestyle.

What does this sub think? And advise?



[댓글]
That study shows that a lack of socialization in adults that go deaf encourages the development of dementia and Alzheimer’s. If you take the hearing aids out but keep your socialization up you should be fine.

I think there can be correlations between lots of things, but it’s important to remember that correlation is not causation.  

Supplements are good for lots of things.  But they don’t prevent hearing loss, nor do they restore hearing.  They also don’t prevent dementia nor do they reverse it.  My

I’ve read up on this a little bit. I agree with the other commenter that mentioned the lack of socialization- but I also feel I should point out that also includes normal social situations in which hearing loss makes it harder to participate in the conversation and socializing that is occurring. 

I have researched this and think about it a lot because I have a relative had Alzheimer’s dementia who has since passed who was female, didn’t attend high school, didn’t eat enough protein and had hearing loss and I wonder about which of the suspected factors contributed. Completely anecdotal but that’s my part.

Intervening effect of social deprivation.

Thank you all for the comments. This is the content I was looking for (pro/con). I'm struggling/afraid as to what the future brings - retirement, new aids, possibly a new city, new friends, etc all on my own.

I was trying to articulate to my doctor about some of these things, but didn't do a very good job. I'll just show her this feed. Now I know I need to be active and social for good health.

Thanks Reddit! I knew the community would provide answers.  :-D

I'm 55, and I've had hearing loss since I was 25. Although I can still hear, I have a hard time understanding normal conversations. In the last years, I have been happy when I am alone. Interaction with people is stressful. Lately my memory and my cognitive skills have declined. 

I believe in these studies 100%.

An overlay to visually show left and right speaker channel levels so I can see which direction sound is coming from.

Streamer to connect my Bluetooth hearing aids to my computer for times I don’t want to use a headset.

Live captioning for spoken audio.

Some hearing aid manufacturers such as ReSound sell a wireless accessory that plugs into the line output of a PC and streams audio directly to your hearing aid(s). If you are lucky enough to have Widex hearing aids, this company sells a USB dongle called  SoundConnect that plugs directly into a USB port, and again streams audio directly to your hearing aids. 

As usual there are a number of caveats:

* With the exception of the Widex USB dongle these accessories tend to be expensive.
* The brand of the accessory must match that of your of hearing aid(s).
* As you are a gamer latency may be a problem, so if possible try before you buy!

The last point is likely to be the deal breaker, for example Oticon claim a latency of 25 ms for their TV Adapter 3.0. Note this is only for an analog audio signal, for a digital signal it is 28 ms and for a Dolby digital signal it is 45 ms.

Given these problems you are better off investing in a good PC sound card plus a decent set of head phones. However before buying anything check on the specification of your PC's existing sound chip as many motherboards already have HiFi quality audio built-in,",2025-04-12 02:46:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jx7f7s/pc_accessories_for_hard_of_hearing_gamer/
1jwxn4u,hardofhearing,Do I get to say I'm half deaf?,"A weird question that people **have** asked before, I know. However, my language doesn't have a term like 'hard of hearing', it only has a term for deaf. Also, I have the serious impression I'm barely deaf enough to call myself 'hard of hearing' anyways; because of a childhood accident in a pool, my right eardrum was ruptured, and, (maybe because of the surgery, maybe because of the rupture itself) I ended up losing 30% of my right ear's ability to hear. My left side can hear just fine and even before starting to use a hearing aid I went through life smoothly if not for a couple of squinting, head turning and ""sorry, what?""'s a day. So I'm not sure If I call myself half deaf or nah

[댓글]
I've seen in disability spaces a huge increase in people asking if they ""get to say"" x or y. why?

I mean, even though I *am* half deaf, being born with 50-70% hearing loss in my right ear, I still say I’m partially. 

But yeah, you can say you’re half deaf if that’s just what’s easier. I’d only really take offense if someone who actually didn’t have hearing issues said that

I call myself hearing impaired

This is funny because I got tested and I’m 40% def in my left ear. I grew up with it so I’ve adapted. Looking for jobs, they ask if I have a disability and I say no. 

I’m in Canada and in order to be considered disabled with the government, you have to have trouble understanding someone familiar in a quiet space. So I guess to that definition I’m not.

Call yourself whatever you think is most representative of you. 

I have always disliked the term ""hard if hearing"", so I've always said ""hearing impaired"". It's hardly a favored term, but I am an autonomous individual and can call myself whether I want. In more recent years, I've started calling myself ""little-d deaf"" because my hearing loss is so significant that I don't hear most things. Anyone with a problem can cry harder, as far as I'm concerned.

I say I have hearing loss.

I say partially deaf. 

My hearing is borderline mild/moderate in the low pitch to severe in the high pitch. Without my hearing aids on and people not facing me so I can read their lips, I might as well be deaf.

Yea that's why I say since it's easier than saying hard of hearing.  Also people immediately know what deaf means but hoh is too much of a spectrum

When I was younger I often used the term half deaf (total loss in my right ear no loss in my left) these days I tend to tell people I’m deaf in my right ear just because it describes it better. When I was younger I was told not to use the term hard of hearing for myself but that was by my really awful speech therapist.

This is something I struggle with too because I feel like Hard of Hearing isn't taken very seriously despite the fact that it's a struggle even with my hearing aids. Without them, I think of myself as functionally deaf because I hear so little that I might as well be, in my opinion. 

I guess maybe try on a few different terms to see what feels right for you. 

Hard of Hearing,  hearing impaired, partially deaf, half deaf, etc.

I just use deaf, even though I usually get by well enough with lip-reading (in a 1-1 setting without echo or much noise). My philosophy is that if you're deaf enough to have trouble hearing people and useful noise (oncoming cars, people, dogs, hearing where something fell) then the masses would call you deaf... ""Are you deaf or something!?""—*yes, actually!* Half-dead if we're being precise. Even though my language does have a word for hard of hearing, people don't make a distinction: if you don't hear them the first time around, you're *deaf* enough.

People are too sensitive. Say what you want

Usually I will refer to myself as having a ""severe hearing disability,"" because my loss is profound and it's the only phrase that people take seriously. With terms like ""hard of hearing"" or ""hearing impaired,"" I would frequently get a jolly ""me, too!"" in response. 

I have a 75% ""loss"" in both ears that I was born with.

We’re literally tge same

To me, go with what you feel comfortable with! if you think half-Deaf fits you, go with that, or if you find that HoH suits you better go with that :) 

so if you feel like half-deaf suits you better, that’s absolutely fine, no one can tell you different, because only YOU know what you struggle with and what you don’t, and what feels right for you :)",2025-04-11 18:58:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jwxn4u/do_i_get_to_say_im_half_deaf/

I'm not a doctor of any kind but I have to assume this is common for us yeah. Two things working against us: 1 need to interpret each letter correctly so can't use context clues to fill in missing parts of the ""sentence"" and get away with it. 2 most letters rhyme, in other words, depending on the type of loss you are missing the only part of the sound that would differentiate the letter. For high pitch for example, very difficult to differentiate F vs S vs X, C vs E vs T

I work on the phones every day with hearing aids. People need to spell their last names for me A LOT. Sometimes it's impossible without asking for clarification. ""Was that M as in Mary or N as in Nancy? Was that B as in Boy or D as in Dog?"" Something along those lines. Be cautious as people can use different words. E can be Elephant from one lady, but some old guy might use Echo.

I end up asking people ""is that S as in Sierra or f as in foxtrot?"" using the NATO phonetic alphabet helps a lot, but even if they use ""m as in mouse"" instead of ""m as in Mike"" it still helps!

My favorite phonetic is to say ""Q, as in 'cucumber'"", then wait as it hits the listener.

""...but... 'cucumber' starts with a 'C'...""

""Oh, no, just a regular cucumber, not a sea cucumber,"" say I, cheerily.

In all seriousness though, yep, NATO phonetic alphabet for the win. Merchant Mariner here with significant hearing loss. Speech banana is sorely missed.

1jvw2mn,hardofhearing,Realized I couldn’t hear people when I was in utero.,"I saw a video on IG recently whereas the parents had been talking to the baby in utero all 9 months. 

Then the newborn stopped crying when placed on dad’s chest and he spoke to it. 

Then I realized I never heard anyone talking to me in utero and as a toddler until I was fitted with an hearing aid at 2.5 years old. 

It was an aha moment of oh and sadness. I knew that my hearing development was delayed and it affected me all my life. 

It’s been interesting seeing all these sign language and development baby videos now online. I didn’t have that opportunity when I was a child back then. No access to asl either. 

When I’m home I prefer not wearing my aid. But to be at work and to be social, I have to wear it.

But not everyone with hearing loss has it due to technology. Not by a long shot. My hearing loss is due to a medical condition. And needing to play my headphones loud is a necessary side effect of the loss… 
And headphones and concert and all sorts of loud stuff has been around for a LONG time. So what’s making it worse NOW versus 50+ years ago. 
And is it really worse? Deaf and HoH people have existed forever….
I’m just providing food for thought

Are you specifically looking for people with noise-related hearing loss? It's a relatively small percentage of people with hearing loss whose issues were caused by noise damage.

Why never an interview or Research about congential hearing loss or ear malformarions? 

If you lost hearing cause you were too stupid to regulate your headphones its on you, I had no choice but to be hard of hearing

yea 90% of hoh are due to genetics

You want to do a phone interview with people who are hard of hearing?

ENT here. Happy to comment from a doctor’s perspective. I also have some hearing los

Deaf since Birth. I began with a moderate hearing loss at 60dB..now I'm profoundly Deaf at 95db. I enjoy music tremendously. I frequent concerts and festivals.. Front row is the best spot! The noise may have contributed the 30db loss over the last 30years.

PM me if you'd like a candidate from this perspective.

I’ve asked a number of doctors, and they say that hearing loss is not caused by noise unless it is extraordinarily loud. Like rock concerts.

Not exactly what you're looking for, and I know this thread is almost 2 weeks old.

1jsxsbf,hardofhearing,Headset for phone for hard of hearing mom,"My mother has become hard of hearing due to an ear infection and loud work noise (warehouse picker).  
  
She does not always wear hearing aids in the house so I purchased the Panasonic New DECT 6.0 Cordless Phone which has an extra loud boost function for her to hear the call better.  It helps but it is not perfect.

The phone has a headphone jack so I would like to get her headphones with a mic (like the truckers have) that will allow her to hear the phone call in a more isolated manner. 

Do you have any recommendations on headphones that are more tailored to the hard of hearing?

Honestly, in my unprofessional opinion, bone conduction earbuds might be the best option. Since your mom is already experiencing hearing loss, traditional earbuds could make it worse. I might be wrong, but bone conduction headphones bypass the eardrum, which can make hearing a bit clearer for some people.",2025-04-06 16:15:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jsxsbf/headset_for_phone_for_hard_of_hearing_mom/
1jsqnuq,hardofhearing,Deaf and don’t know sign language — has anyone ever done a text-based job interview?,"I’m deaf but I don’t use sign language, and I rely entirely on written communication. I’ve always wondered if anyone else has done a job interview completely through text—like typing back and forth instead of speaking or using interpreters.

Has anyone experienced this? How did it go? Was the employer open to it?

Just curious to hear stories or thoughts!

From my limited understanding they have to make accommodations for people who are disabled and in the case of a dead person  that includes providing an interpreter, written correspondence and alerting devices etc. 

You’ll just need to put a request in writing to have a written interview and they should accept.

Not with this but even as someone who is oral and learning sign language and wears hearing aids. It was still challenging to get the very minor accommodations I needed. I wish you best of luck.

I am entirely deaf, and worked remotely for a number of years. I have used automated transcriptions in Google Meetings for job interviews many, many times for years. I've used that tool to manage teams, and interface with employers every single day. There are also many live transcription tools you can use on a phone that do work quite well, for in person meetings, especially 1:1 with another person.  
  
You could also get a [CapTel phone](https://clearcaptions.com/bing/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=competitors&amp;utm_term=captel%20phone&amp;msclkid=cfb50dbd42f71cf74c646a4fcad99c8a), where you can speak, and the other person on the line is transcribed and you see it as text.

And of course employing [CART Services](https://languagest.com/what-is-cart-and-why-does-it-matter/), which I used many, many times for years, before all the tech became quite handy. 

There are tons of options actually today! It used to be a bit more challenging, but I have found the Google Meeting method to be the quickest and easiest for interviews.

I’m late-deafened and have bilateral CIs, but they’re not perfect and sometimes I have issues understanding people, especially when they have accents. So I did this one group video interview where ALL of the interviewers had accents that I couldn’t easily understand. I explained the problem (minus the part about the accents; I just said I have hearing difficulties and use cochlear implants, and I was having trouble), and they offered to type in their questions, which I then answered verbally. It worked out fine and I did get a job offer.

Not sure if this is helpful, because I was still speaking even if they weren’t. But they were very nice and understanding about it, and I figured that any company that didn’t want to hire me because of my hearing was probably not someplace I wanted to work anyway.",2025-04-06 09:54:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jsqnuq/deaf_and_dont_know_sign_language_has_anyone_ever/

1jryqy6,hardofhearing,Post-Op Timpanoplasty Questions and Advice,"Hi everyone, I had a timpanoplasty surgery yesterday, and I’m looking for some advice from those who’ve gone through the same procedure. How was your post-op recovery? Any tips or recommendations to make it easier? Are there any specific positions that helped you sleep comfortably during the recovery period? Will the pain or discomfort increase over the next few days, or does it tend to get better? How long did it take you to fully recover? Any general advice or things you wish you knew before the surgery? Thanks in advance for your help!

[댓글]
I had a tympanoplasty surgery a little over a month and a half ago and overall recovery has gone well. One thing I strongly recommend avoiding is doomscrolling / searching up symptoms online most of what you’ll find will tell you something is wrong even though it's not a proper indicator of issues. (if you are concerned contact your doctor) 

From what I understand, my case was on the more severe side, but just two days ago I was officially cleared to resume all activities, except those that involve getting my ear wet.

Sleep-wise, the first few days were rough I had to sleep upright due to nausea from the general anesthesia. After that, I laid on the opposite side of the operated ear even though I normally sleep on the side. I've just recently returned to my usual sleeping position.

In terms of pain, the worst was probably in the first few days, assuming you had a relatively mild procedure. I can’t speak for everyone, but for me, the most uncomfortable part wasn’t from the surgery itself, but a rare side effect from the breathing tube something with very few documented cases.

If there’s one piece of advice I wish I had before going through it: don’t stress. As well the surgery I had was far more severe than what I had read about beforehand. 

“Tympanoplasty” is such a general term it can mean anything from a simple patch on the eardrum to a full replacement using a skin graft.

On a end note drainage unless your doctor tells you otherwise it seems to be normal as I am still draining from my ear now after being cleared for physical activities.

I have bought their holsters and safety rings. I like them, but have found I don't need to wear them regularly.

I like their chains a lot! I don’t wear them every day though, but often when I wear my hair up in a bun or ponytail

Same but i find the cuff fiddly to put on.

I bought some of the holsters! I actually bought an ear cuff from a different jeweler, but use the holster and ear cuff every day - just keeps things a bit more secure (I do yoga, climbing and things that have my head tipped at weird angles).

I've actually found sliding the holster up from what's shown on their website (I actually have it straddle the volume button on my phonak infinio) has been the most comfortable positioning for me.

I’ve bought holsters and cuffs along with chains. I love their jewelry! I don’t use it every day but I love having the option and get so many compliments.

I work with special needs kids. One of the kids often hits me and has previously broken a pair of my glasses. I can take them off as I really need them to drive and read etc. I prefer to wear them but if he is having a tuff day I remove them. But, I worry about my hearing aids. I can’t afford to replace them. They cost more than I make in a month. Do y’all have any suggestions that I can look into?

""try to hear better"".....

If only it was that easy heh?

Hey OP, I’m sorry you are going through this. 

It’s definitely her, not you. Please remember that you deserve grace both from yourself and others.

Wow, I cannot imagine a ""friend"" saying such a rude thing. It's her. Full stop. 

I her view, there should not be elevators right - A paraplegic is just too lazy to walk?

She's not a friend, I hope you have better ones so you don't have to be around this nastiness

Your friend’s response is as *ignorant* as telling a blind person to “open your eyes” or telling a paraplegic to “get up and walk”. Your friend cannot comprehend what you’re experiencing and isn’t even trying. Do you want to remain friends with someone who so clearly lacks empathy?

What an utter imbecile.

Yeah… if she weren’t so consistently awful, I’d say something like: “Maybe explain asking her to repeat herself is actually a sign that you care about what she says and want to make sure you don't miss anything.” But… yikes.

The truth is, it's a part of life—we all go through moments where we start to see people through a different lens. It kind of sounds like this friendship may have been more about convenience than connection, which sucks to realize.

There are a lot of easy-to-say tropes and platitudes about losing friends, but none of them make it less painful. It is hard. I hope you’re able to find people who don’t punish you or make you feel bad for trying your best—whether that’s related to your hearing or any other challenge you’re navigating.

You know, my pet peeve is ableist asshats who equate a physical disability with being ""lazy"" or ""not caring.""

Your not-a-friend should hope nothing bad ever happens to her where she needs accommodations. I've heard it said that pretty much everyone will be disabled at some point in their lifetime, we're all just temporarily abled. She might find out the hard way what it's like to live in a world where people treat her the way she's treating you.

In any case, there are way better people out there and you should find friends who understand and support you. They're out there, and the sooner you stop wasting time with people like her, the sooner you will be able to surround yourself with caring friends.

I can't wear my hearing aids anymore bc I have double ear infections and can't get to a doctor for them. I knew my abusive relationship was hitting new lows when my ex started getting mad at me for not being able to hear and bitching about it out loud.

yeah man sorry I got shot in the head and got brain damage. christ.

Note from a German with English as second language:""You're"".

Text her back sorry couldn’t hear you can you speak up!! 

Then drop her like a bad habit.

Sounds like insecurities to me. What I would do is save that so when people ask you. You can show them the evidence and let them be the judge if they want to be like that so call friend or not. 

It sounds like that person has a strong basis against anyone who is not like them. So yes it sucks big time. But this is also a beafutil way of getting rid of shallow people.

What an ableist POS. Block them and move on knowing you're better off.

This is not a friend. This person is making your livelihood about them. Calling you lazy is an INSANE reaction. I’ve dropped a few friends for treating my disability as a nuisance. It’s not worth it.

People like that – with zero self-awareness and pure selfishness – are just toxic burdens. They won't ever have your back; they only expect you to help them.

Seen it firsthand in some people close to me whom I love. My partner got MS symptoms at 12 (diagnosed at 14). All but one 'friend' bailed, ignored her, or straight-up bullied her. Years later, her dad / my late father-in-law got MS too (progressive, hit him harder). His 'friends'? Visited once, saw him having a bad day (poor motor control, drooling), got freaked out, and ghosted. He also ended up with just one friend who stuck by him.

It's disturbing how easily supposed 'friends' vanish when things get real. I count myself incredibly lucky my friends are loyal – they've stuck around through illness of other friends, stuck by one of my friends who experienced a severe mental health crisis (I think it was like delusions / psychosis that went on for a few months straight), and even when someone was distant for years and still welcomed them with open arms (me, in that case). But man, it feels exceptionally rare.

It's sad how illness starkly reveals who your true friends are (and aren't). Guess that's the grim silver lining, right? Better to know who you can actually count on.

this was so nonsensical up until I found out that you’re living with her for free. …I don’t think this is about ableism, that’s just the excuse she’s using to create distance because there clearly is resentment here. 

I think it’s worth communicating to see if this can be resolved or it’s time to consider finding a new place to crash.

My response ""you know I have hearing difficulties. If what you are saying is important you'll make sure I have the best chance of hearing it. Face me, enunciate, and be patient. I have no more ability to 'hear better' than a paraplegic has to walk.""

100% of friendship is communication. If they don't care then they aren't a friend.

Oh no really why are you even still friends with this person? Just block him/her and move on with your life. Talk to your therapist, take a long bath. Do whatever you need to do to make yourself happy. But you deserve better than this crap!

I always try to communicate clearly what I need. E.g. ""Please look at me when you talk. Please talk a bit slower. Please repeat that last sentence? Let's move to a quieter area. ""
Be as specific as you can so that people understand what you need.
The people who love you will make the effort.

Your friend is an asshole, and they don’t deserve your time. Hearing loss is not something we can control and it certainly isn’t something we chose. The comments they made are so ableist it’s *almost* laughable… if it weren’t so damn infuriating.

I am so sorry, and I hope your other friends are better than this sorry excuse.

friend cannot imagine the concept of doing something nice for other people

They're the one who needs to learn basic grammar, and until they do you will not text with them knowing that they are too lazy to learn the difference between ""your"" and ""you're"".

I stoped hanging out with people that wont meed me half way, it’s not worthy the energy.

Cut her off, you’re already putting ib effort to use hearingaids (if you do use them) and understand her. I’ve been through people like this, they’re stupid.

Reading her response made me nauseous. She gives a ""*Caleb*"" vibe from A Little Life *literally*

Wow, what a horrible “friend”! I’ve been HOH my entire life and I have never had a friend like that. You deserve better OP. Dump this person like the trash they are

The best way to reframe this whole situation for yourself would probably be to see it as the trash taking themselves out! Better to know now than keep going for years with snide comments and attacks because she can't grasp what a disability is or how simple it is to accommodate something like speaking louder or repeating yourself. I'm sorry but yes, it might be frustrating to repeat yourself, but that's nothing on the daily frustrations of just not being able to hear! 

So sorry you've had to experience this OP. At least you know who to unfriend now. X

Damn I’m sorry you were treated like this. People without hearing loss have no idea how difficult it is TO hear and follow what others are saying. Such a shameful comment from her. I wouldn’t even bother with someone like that.

What a wild response to someone struggling to hear

Sorry you're going through this, buddy. It really hurts when something like this happens! They don't sound like a true friend anyway, so if anything, the ignorant trash has taken itself out. I really hope that further down the line, they get a bad ear infection that leaves them with greatly reduced hearing. Maybe then they'll finally understand what it is you've been going through.

Bruh i just blew up in my coworker about this yesturday. Hes always acting frustrated and getting upset he has to repeat himself. Which, i get it bro. Im frustrated i have to ask you to all the damn time to repeat yourself. But i told him i CANNOT control what i do and dont hear. You CAN control your emotions and the volume of your voice. Hes much happier today..

I’m so sorry. This is so hurtful. 😞

I'm really sorry. Good riddance that you can drop this asshole though.

I had some friends like that. I stopped speaking to them. Only signed with them. Yeah. Those people suck. It hurts.

What's insane to me is her claiming that you 'don't care' about what she has to say when you asking her to speak up or repeat herself means YOU WANT TO KNOW. I hate that so much. I don't think people like this understand the effort it takes to focus on their words and try to decipher what they are saying. It is so much easier to ignore them! but you care enough to ask her to speak up and repeat herself. These are the kinds of people I turn my hearing aids off around. Good luck living with her OP.

You are not the problem!!!! People like this are.

Thats absolutely horrible. I hope you find better friends 🫶

There is a one word answer appropriate for this response: “Bye!”

I have to remind my husband that I’m actually HoH. He has that same ‘pet peeve’ about repeating himself, and I have to remind him that I’m HoH and it’s not fair to not include me in the conversation

These types of people are not friends. They are bitter, negative, nasty people. Someone who is your friend will be patient and understanding with you, because they will accept everything that comes with you; even your loss of hearing. A true friend will look for ways to make things easier for you and accommodate you. My close friends always make sure I am accommodated and I am grateful. You will find people like this one day, but unfortunately you’ll also encounter the bad ones like here. I know the feeling &lt;/3 Hugs.

I'm so sorry, OP. My first reaction was ""well, that friendship is dead"" as for myself, I'd definitely call it quits right then and there, but then I saw in the comments that you are living with her, which makes the situation immensely more complicated, especially given the reason. Maybe you can bring it up to some other more supportive friends who could have your back and talk some sense into her. Either way, I hope things get better somehow. *hugs from an internet stranger*

Oh lord. Please run from this person and don't look back. This is a special kind of asshole.

I would literally never talk to this person ever again

Hey, I’m deaf/hard of hearing since I was born. I never ever saw this and this would piss me off A LOT. I never saw something THAT disrespectful. This is worse than not being a friend. I would really just block this person.

Good riddance!

I know nothing about either you or this person, and yet its so clear who is in the wrong. Whoever this is is a selfish, inconsiderate and self centered asshole who would probably pull the plug on someone to charge their phone. They are not worth your time or energy at all, and they have no right making you feel like you are lazy or broken.

Does anyone have advice for this? I see that Broadway has audio descriptions and closed captioning devices. Do these work well? Did they make the experience enjoyable? Please give me some advice!! ❤️❤️❤️

[댓글]
I am a MAJOR theatre nerd, and I'm also HoH. I went to NYC last year before getting my hearing aids so I was unable to use the telecoil feature that I now have. I only have mild to moderate hearing loss right now (it's progressive), and knowing the lyrics to the songs before seeing the shows helped immensely, but dialogue was really difficult. If she can't hear movies, she would definitely want to use the assitive devices in the theater.   I would suggest calling the Gershwin theater and asking about their hearing assist options. Most theaters have a number you can call for questions about accessibility. Three of the theaters we went to were amazing with accessibility when we called to ask questions about seating with my service dog, one of them was horrible and never actually called us back in the 4 weeks we waited. That was a whole crazy story, and I won't go into details, but don't be afraid to call multiple times if they don't immediately get back to you.

The Broadway level theater in my area will run a show for 2-4 weeks. Near the beginning of the run, they’ll have a show fully interpreted. Near the end of the run, they’ll have a show fully captioned. I’m trying to find out exactly how that works myself. 

Try reaching out to the theater and see if the normally accommodate certain showings or if it’s a case by case basis.

I saw Wicked in Spokane a couple of years ago and they had two ASL interpreters for the show.  You might have to buy more expensive tickets to get close to the interpreters.

I'm hard of hearing and I found that reading a synopsis of the plot of the show before seeing it (if I'm unfamiliar with the show) and listening to the songs while reading the lyrics until I've almost memorized them all help me follow a show really well. Big plus for the shows that have almost no lines, just songs.

Funny story, I went to see ""Come From Away"" and even though I prepped one line really evaded me. I swear I heard one of the pilots saying he had ""a plane full of witches"" multiple times and I just didn't get the significance. After the show I asked my daughter what that was about. Turned out it was ""a plane full of make-a-wish kids"" which made a lot more sense!

I just saw maybe happy ending on Broadway and used my phone as the caption device (they have a specific app for it) and it worked 97% I would say. Sometimes it was a little delayed or would just lines but otherwise it was great and made it easier to follow along with the show. Feel free to ask other questions. Depending on the show they sometimes do an open caption night too where they project the captions on the wall of the theatre

New York Native Deaf/HH theater lover. If you are specifically looking to see wicked they have ALDs (they'll just ask for your id information so they can get it back of you forget to return it). They work fine if you are seated on the lower level. (What it is is a direct feed from the sound board) 

If you go to NYC often enough. Look into getting what's called a TDF ACCESS account. It's 40$ for the whole year, all you need to do is submit proof of disability and they will add you to their TAPs system. It's shows you all the shows in NYC on/off bway that have ASL Interpreted shows, open captions, etc. it's very very cool.

I have the same as your kiddo but moderate 

I had have experience both oiticon and phonak hearing aids.. I currently use phonak. 

The only difference is the mechanics of how each brand works. USA focuses more on phonak meanwhile other countries focus more on oiticon. 

Both are really good brands. I like both. It's really raining the brain to work with either of them. 

With children and toddlers since they grow a lot don't be surprised if you have to get new ear molds every year.

both of my kids have oticon play. (one has a cros system) they are pretty great and I have had no complaints. My husband and I both have Starkey and we have no issues either. Like stated above you will be getting ear molds often, I think when my son was that age it was ever 3-4 months, now it is every year.

It’s great that you’re looking for a solution but remember sometimes our imminent reaction is uncontrollable so don’t be harsh on yourself if you slip sometimes. When irritated give yourself 5 seconds to breathe before asking them to repeats themself and that should allow you to calm down a bit before engaging with them. I suggest sharing with your 12 year old what it’s like for you to live with hearing loss. Turn up music and talk quietly to them repeatedly. Move around the room while asking them things to give them a sense of what it’s like for you. Help them realise the seriousness of the situation

You could try coming up with a system so that you are all on the same page about how to communicate with you. (Minus your 3 year old, for the time being). For example, my husband and I have a system where if I can't understand what he's saying, he will say three times (if needed) at which point he will reword or modify what he's saying if I still can't understand. Or, if there's a situation where I know I won't be able to hear him (like if he's in another room) I will just say ""I can't hear you"" and he'll come into the room where I am to talk.

It’s very irritating and isolating, but try to laugh and reframe it. I get very upset when I can’t hear anything or don’t know what’s going on, but people are patient with me and I verbalize my needs

talk to her and explain how much you're struggling. A lot of people don't realize how hard unilateral hearing loss is (in my experience they assume you're fine because you still have hearing in one ear). It's natural to struggle and you shouldn't be upset at yourself for being frustrated. As for the kids, try explaining to them (obviously three year olds are not the best listeners lmao) that they need to speak a little louder so you can hear them properly

I tell people often, “if I’m not looking at you, I’m not hearing you.” Enough so that now people I work with will often say, “oh, you’re not looking at me” and make sure I’m looking at them before talking. The other thing I encounter often is that people will speak louder, and I tell them I often what I need is for them to speak more clearly, not louder. 

I’ve been wearing hearing aids for 15 years. I know it’s not easy for my husband, and it’s not easy for me. It takes lots of patience and grace — from both of us, both with each other and with ourselves.

I just started saying ""I cannot hear you""  it was annoying having to say ""huh"" or ""what"" and it also annoyed the people I said it to.

I like to share with them the funny things I thought I heard them say which made no sense. For small children sometimes there is no hope
for me to ever understand them and I have to look at another adult in the room to help me. Background sound also makes it impossible for me to understand and I just shake my head and say it can’t be done. 
It’s you and them together trying to navigate your hearing loss.

You can repeat back what you did hear and they can clarify the words you misheard? I do that sometimes and it helps.  I get frustrated too when I just can’t make it out no matter how many times they say it. It’s tough with kids for sure.",2025-04-02 20:53:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jpzjw4/wanting_to_reduce_irritability_when_i_cant/
1jpe0r2,hardofhearing,I need to vent,"I was recently diagnosed with hearing loss, and they told me that I may need hearing aids. I have no stigma around this at all, but I didn’t feel like sharing this information with others due to some stigmas that they may have. With that being said, I opened up to one of my coworkers (A), and they ended up telling another coworker (B). Coworker B then continued to act like they were doing the alphabet in sign language and muffling letters out loud. They then said “I’ve gotta learn the alphabet for you.” I felt so disgusted and disrespected. I still feel that way.

Yeah, people suck, and they can really surprise you with their stupidity. Next time they do it, literally tell them straight up that you don't appreciate being spoken to that way, it's rude. They might say they're joking but you can say you are not, don't let people weasel out of their behavior. Keep it surface level with these coworkers from now on... You will have to learn to advocate for yourself a lot more now... It's easier said than done, but people will generally respect you more and it'll get easier the more you do it.

This sucks.  

I worked with a guy who would deliberately speak very softly when speaking with me, but would speak normally to others. 

Other than that he never gave any indication that he was messing with me. 

He was a passive aggressive coward.

Coworker B has shown you that they have profound personality problems. I think they need therapy.

At least now you know who they really are.

I had a *lifelong* friend comment on a photo I shared (which was the last event I attended before getting hearing aids) and she said “wow, you don’t look deaf”.  A discussion ensued about how I was going to be wearing hearing aids for the rest of my life and what she said was inappropriate. Long story short, we aren’t friends anymore.

I’m very sorry for the breach in trust you experienced. On top of this, the ignorance and bullying too. Report it to HR!!

Honestly, report him to HR. He is mocking your disability

They’re horrible. You don’t deserve that.

It's basically bullying and you would do well to keep track of those types of incidents from that person, that's just not ok.

Maybe you can hide with hair? I have hearing aids recently, nobody really noticed.

Was he trying to make a joke? Like, hey it's no big deal, etc kinda thing? 

Sometimes I wonder if I'm autistic because sometimes I don't get what the big deal is with certain things. Picturing myself in this situation, I can't really envision how I'd feel, my gut is to think he is making a bad joke.  Maybe it's just the way I've read your comment.

Does anyone think it would  help if i made a sign  with a symbol  to show im deaf or are they going to just ignore  it.  

[댓글]
I think including a sign is a good idea.

I would. I am also HoH, 25f  and have done craft fairs before, but it was before starting to lose my hearing. I would definitely add a sign to my table. It would make me feel more comfortable as I have social anxiety so interacting with other people is already tricky without the added hassle of trying to lipread/hear the amount I can.

Agree with others about adding a sign. It helps to get ahead of the struggle. 

Best of luck with your craft show, I hope you feel proud and satisfied by the end of it! :)

A sign may be helpful. I have a white sheep-shaped pin that I can write on with a sharpie, and wipe it off with nail polish remover, that I picked up for using in situations like that. Perhaps that could help, too.

I’m also HoH and I do lots of craft shows! I do wear my hearing aids and rely on lip reading a lot. I also have my booth set up so it’s facing one direction so I can see everyone in front of me, which helps a lot!
Be prepared to have a headache and be tired at the end haha

depends on the venue to be honest .. i quite literally wear a sign that says im hard of hearing and sometimes people get short with me ... hopefully all goes well and now im curious what kind of crafts

Some people may ignore it, but there will probably be a decent amount who will take notice and respond accordingly. Idk what symbol you'd use, but it may not be recognizable to the hearing, so I'd include words.

1jmyucc,hardofhearing,Disinterest in medical treatments and research,"So I got diagnosed with mild hogh tone hearing loss following a bilateral chronic infection. Not bad enough for hearing aids as it doesn't really affect my understanding of speech, but I do miss birds and the generally muffled/quitened soundscape is terrible.

Most of all I am still outraged over my experience at the doctor. For example, I had some relatives get diagnosed with cancer. The diagnosis may be a shock, but the next steop is to talk about treaments and perspectives. In those cases, the affected people ended up fine.

Lets compare hearing loss: The initial diagnosis is a shock. Then follows an empathetic shrug and a hearty ""lol, your hearing is cooked, yes until you die, havee a nice day"". And thats it. What the hell? I don't expect doctors to produce magical wonder cures, but come on, not even a proper diagnosis, just some superficial damage assesment and thats it. And I'm even relatively lucky, its just some one off damage and not progressive. EVen more unbelievable that doctors sit by idly as a patients hearing rots away. Imagine if doctors did the same if someone comes in with a gangrenous foot. Just sit by until uit rots off, then fit a prothesis. How can thsi stand? How are people not frothing with rage at being treated like that?

What I thingk plays a major role here  is the total lack of lobbying and interest by hearing loss sufferers and their associations. When I talked to some people from such an association here about tretments and diagnostics, they got incredibvly defensive: Its all pointless, we will never know anything, there will never be treatments, best defund research because its all fraud anyways (yes, seriously). Its all hearing aids with those people, even though these things neither are nor will ever be an actual solution to the problem.  
Theres a few notable exeptions such a s the Birtish RNID, who have actually funded one of the most promising projects in regards to an actual solution to the hearing loss question, but the vast majority somehow seem to assume tha hearing loss research will be stuck in the 1950s for eternity. IUÄm not even talking very advanced stuff like hair cell regeneration, but proper diagnostics, finding out the various causes of hearing loss and learning to treat those before hearing loss setsin, creating genetics databases  and so on.

Now my question, why is that? Other disability groups have ceaselessly lobbied for medical research and helped a great deal to bring about progress. For example, HIV groups kept fighting now matter how bleak things looked for half a century, and thanks to that we have very effective AIDS medication nowadays that allows sufferes to live practically normal, same with diabetes.

So what is it about hearing loss specifically? The people I talked to seemed to have already given up completely and consigned themselves to hearing aids forevermore, even though medicine is one of the very few fields that is still innovating in leaps and bounds and tons of ""incurable"" diseases have become treatable over the past decade alone. Why is it that those hard of hearing some times get downright hostile when it concerns research?

  
EDIT: I am aware that I'm ranting here as someone who isn't facing a disability, just miss the normal acuity of my fomerly proper hearing. As such I understand that the persepctive of someone struggling to hold a conversation may be different. Still, even then I fail to understand how there is such little emphasis on research. Even advocacy groups for Multiple Sclerosis or Quadriplegia have dedicated research departments and lobby for research, even though their issues are most likely much harder to treat than hearing issues.

It’s about money. There are advancements made, CIs no longer remove all residual hearing. Doctors can replace the tiny bones in your ear. Hearing aids are getting more advanced every year. 

Why should companies invest millions to research to solve a problem not many people have that can be helped with hearing aids. 

The other side of the coin goes into Deaf Pride, but I don’t think it’s in the scope of your post.

&gt; but proper diagnostics, finding out the various causes of hearing loss and learning to treat those before hearing loss setsin

That is a thing though. There are genetic tests for hearing loss that is inherited. There are brain scans that look for abnormalities causing hearing loss. There are intake forms looking at medication use and noise exposure that could explain hearing loss. There are steroid treatments for sudden sensorineural hearing loss. If your doctor didn't do a thorough assessment, you should seek a second opinion from two types of specialists (ENT and an audiologist).  

All that said, there is no cure for SNHL. Once the hair cells are killed, that's it. There is research attempting to find ways to regrow the cells, but AFAIK they have not been successful in humans, only mice. There has also been some success in treatment for genetic related hearing loss - https://www.bbc.com/news/health-68921561

Ultimately, you may need hearing aids - yes, even for mild hearing loss (that's what I have, and I have hearing aids).

What's your audiogram like? I'm down 55db across speech frequencies (in one ear due to SSNHL from acute labyrinthitis) and am surprised my ENT says I don't need a HA.

I'm absolutely with you, there's also really poor awareness about hearing health, especially if you happened to have been born in the wrong era.

Everyone seems to just assume too loud = tinnitus, too much noise = go deaf and you get a hearing aid and problem solved but there's so much more to it than that.

I'd never heard of hyperacusis before I got it and now I basically am disabled and home bound unless I want to risk it worsening in a let's be honest, incredibly loud modern world.

I also had no idea just how debilitating tinnitus could be if you get it badly.

This stuff can impact even people with good hearing genetics through sheer bad luck, it needs funding, it needs awareness and it can and must change.

A lot more people are going to start being impacted, I hope they don't have to suffer the same bleak response we did when they go for treatment.",2025-03-29 23:09:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jmyucc/disinterest_in_medical_treatments_and_research/

1jljpye,hardofhearing,Aaahh... the confusion I cause strangers just by my existence,"Background: Damaged someone's property. Totally my fault. I caused the situation and was fully willing to pay out of pocket.

Unfortunately, we disagreed on method of payment. This caused some back-and-forth, and led to us agreeing I should talk to their bank.

Where the confusion came in: The two of us communicated initially through text message, on my cell phone. But when they gave my number to their bank and their bank called my cell phone to talk to me, I had to ignore the call and call the bank from my VP/VRS phone number. When the bank let the person know this, this caused them think I was practicing subterfuge and trying to get out of paying.

**I always ALWAYS forget that it's seen as ""shady"" to have two different numbers**. I would have let them know before they told their bank to call me that I'd have to talk on a different phone number, but I simply didn't think to relay this information because... that's just how I get along. I forget that how I get along is ""abnormal"".

When we met in person (during which I'm talking and lipreading, so thus seeming completely Hearing) and they told me they felt uncomfortable with the fact that I called their bank from a different number, I explained. 

Luckily, I happened to have my hearing aids in, which helped give ""validity"" to what I told them. They seemed to believe me. But I think: what if I didn't have my hearing aids in? They would've just continued to feel I was lying and trying to give out of my responsibility (which is silly because it happened right where I live, so it's not like I was going to give up my apartment to run from paying them).

Existing is just exhausting. There's hardly a moment where I don't need to explain to someone my essential being in the world.

I'm sorry that happened. Existing is exhausting. I think being HoH has made me more compassionate on the whole because I now understand what it's like having people constantly upset over something about you that you have no control over and how important accommodations are. It's so beyond infuriating when people get pissy and annoyed with the way we need things to be in order for us to live ""normal"" lives. I hope things go more smoothly with that individual if you have future encounters.

I think part of the problem is that hearing people typically have no training in how to deal with deaf people and very little personal experience.  I have seen a list of Do's and Don'ts and once you see them most of them immediately make sense but without those guidelines even people with the best of intentions will make mistakes.  

If this is indeed part of the problem should we teach the public how to respond?  If so what's the best way to disseminate the information?  One way would be to create a public service announcement that plays as an advertisement in those games we play on our phones.

I use CaptionCall for free. It uses your actual phone number. So you don’t need a second number. People calling in don’t even know you’re HOH, so no explaining anything.",2025-03-28 01:34:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jljpye/aaahh_the_confusion_i_cause_strangers_just_by_my/

Obligatory Not A Doctor, but:

  
Sclerosed = hardened or indurated, as by sclerosis.  
Scleroris = A medical condition  that causes body tissue or organs to become harder.

Mastoid = A large piece of bone that is part of the back of the skull just behind each ear. 

I'm going to assume it's this bone:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid\_part\_of\_the\_temporal\_bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_part_of_the_temporal_bone)

Check a second opinion. 

There is surgery for eustachian tube dysfunction. It’s done with a balloon through the nose. The success rate is high, but some people need a second or even third surgery a few years later. 

However, I would still look for a second opinion. ETD by itself rarely causes major hearing loss. So you want to make sure there’s not something else as underlying cause. 

Good luck!!

I have a genetic hearing loss and grew up with our mom having the same hearing loss. To keep this from being a novel, we learned the ""rules,"" for communicating with someone who is hard-of-hearing by trial and error. 

We even went through a phase when I was in my early 20s and my sister was 10 where my mom would ask someone a question and either refuse to look at them, or turn her back as they answered!

My hearing loss isn't as bad as our mom's loss. But, my mom has had surgery (which didn't fully work) and has worn hearing aids for three decades. But, she is nearly fully deaf in one ear and relies on her one ear and is good at reading lips. It is nearly impossible to talk to her about an unfamiliar topic via telephone. She is adept at reading lips. I also know she fakes understanding at times, she will laugh or smile at jokes others respond to and if I ask her what was said, because I didn't understand, she will admit she doesn't know.

So, my sister grew up with the same parents and same conditions. Our mom did have her first, most successful, surgery when this sister was very young. This means our mom always had one good ear during my sister's life. But, my sister will start conversations with me with her back turned, or through a wood door, or with her head in the fridge, then be upset that I interrupted her train of thought by asking, ""What?""

This just happened again and now she wants me to wait until she has finished speaking, then remind her to look at me and only then ask her to repeat herself! Honestly, I don't understand! I don't think she talks to our mom while not looking at her. She talks to our mom all the time. Why is this all on me to ""fix"" our communication issues?

I currently have Oticon Opn S 2 miniRITE R aids that I got in early 2021. Overall I really like them, but I’ve been having increasingly frustrating issues - primarily the left one turning off and turning back on, and also dying way, way faster than the right one. 

They’ve already been replaced once by Oticon for similar issues in 2023, but were still under warranty at the time, so it was free of charge. I’m now outside the warranty and the problems are getting worse, to the point that I think I just need new HAs. 

Our new health insurance plan doesn’t cover HAs (or anything hearing-related), so everything is out of pocket. I’m trying to decide whether I should go through an independent audiology office (as opposed to through the hospital system Audiology department like last time), or if I should go through Costco (we have a membership). 

The hearing aids I’m currently considering are the Oticon Intent or Oticon Real. I don’t think Costco carries Oticon, so I’m hesitant to go through them since I prefer to stick with a brand I like. 

Does anyone have any experience with either of the HA models I mentioned? And/or do you have thoughts about going through an independent office vs Costco?

Anything that is extra loud or has flashing lights or maybe she needs something that is plugged in and is super Duper extra loud? Any suggestions are very appreciated! Thank you!

I use my Fitbit as a timer because it vibrates instead of making a noise. 
It also works well as an alarm in the morning.

An Apple Watch with a necklace attachment.

I think you could get away with some sort of modern digital watch that has basic fitness tracking in it. Some models have the vibrators built right into them as well, she could set a timer or an alarm. That's what I do. 🤷‍♂️

My iPhone has flashing lights for alerts and alarms which has been really helpful. You might check accessibility settings on her phone.

My hearing aids are Bluetooth enabled. The timer alarm goes through my hearing aids.

I use a smart watch for timers as it vibrates and now I have HAs it dings in my ears really loudly when it runs out. I have Android so it's a pixel watch 3.

I use a Garmin watch. It has an alarm, timer, and stopwatch function.  It lights up and vibrates.",2025-03-23 21:41:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jial4w/looking_for_a_timer/
1ji1ss8,hardofhearing,Apps for transcribing,"Hey guys, first time here because I am looking for an app that can go on a mobile device for my grandfather. He is extremely hard of hearing-borderline completely deaf-and he is too old for surgery, doesn’t want to learn ASL, and isn’t tech savvy.

Are there any apps you guys like or would recommend? If anybody knows an app that has Filipino dialects that would be incredible too. 

[댓글]
Does he have an android phone? There is a transcription app built in

If he has an iPad that supports the new iOS, there’s a way to set up live captions. [This link](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/get-live-captions-of-spoken-audio-ipad0bbca12e/ipados) walks you through it. It’s relatively easy to learn but I couldn’t say how it will deal with Filipino dialects.

Otter.ai is a very well established transcription app. I find it works better than the built in Apple Live transcription.

Oh for transcription I actually have some experience with this! Your built-in phone dictation/speech-to-text can work decently for basic stuff, but for longer conversations (especially medical appointments) you might want something more robust.

We built Hedy AI specifically for situations like this - it does real-time transcription and can actually help explain medical terms in simpler language. The basic version is free and works well for both English and Filipino.

But heres a helpful tip regardless of what app you use - always let doctors know upfront that your recording for accessibility reasons. Most are super understanding about it!

Let me know if you wanna try Hedy AI - happy to set you up with a free account so you can test it out with your grandfather. No pressure tho, the built-in phone stuff might be enough depending on his needs :)",2025-03-23 15:27:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ji1ss8/apps_for_transcribing/

Are there any positives to being HoH? What's your experience like? 

So far I've come up with these ones:

1. On planes if there's a crying baby, I put on my headphones and basically can't hear anything. 
2. My lip reading has gotten better.
3. Can't hear construction noises if I lay on my left side in the morning. 
4. Have cut down on drinking because bars are annoying so I've saved some money.

Idk... is that it? Tell me yours.

[댓글]
All of my friends, family, and I have kids. Being able to turn off the hearing aids is such a power move. I'm able to babysit through the crying stages with very little discomfort.

Even my hearing friends have started putting captions on because they realize how much they miss. 

The best one in my opinion is my husband can choose a morning alarm that I can't hear. 

My hearing aids have Bluetooth so I can be connected to my phone. It's like having invisible earbuds in.

Edit: I forgot the best one about having tinnitus. It's forced me to take better care of myself. When I'm too stressed, my tinnitus gets bad enough that I can't sleep. 2 times this has been because I'm in a job that I'm trying to convince myself to stay at but is not healthy for me. It's the sign that I need to take care of myself and make a positive change for my health. Jobwise, diet wise, or other.

If anything is too loud, just mute or take my hearing aids off, it’s amazing. Also getting to know a new community and language is always interesting and fun. 

Also, I love being able to listen to music whenever I want and no one knows. Or watching TikTok’s or instagram reels when I’m in a lecture and they don’t know what I’m listening to or watching

I’m always looking for the bright side of things. Got told I’m going deaf and will probably be deaf before I’m 30 (and that’s being hopeful), why be sad about it? Yea it’s a bit shit and tinnitus sucks (biggest understatement), but like, Bluetooth hearing aids? Yay. Hearing aid accessories? Super yay. (I LOVE my accessories sm, I always buy accessories for my aids and mobility devices and it makes me feel so much better about them, almost makes up for the disabilities😂)

I have mostly high frequency hearing loss but it also affects my midrange hearing. 

One of my favorite things to tell people is I can’t hear nails screeching on a chalkboard. Such a blessing, I don’t even remember what it sounded like

Last year my husband and I went to Hawaii. Huge bucket list trip for us after a decade long illness on his part. We rented a tent cabin on the Big Island about a mile inland. It was glorious! 

BUT the frogs, insects, and chicken noises at night and in the early morning were incredibly loud! Like 80-90 decibel loud! At night, when I took off my hearing aids, I couldn’t hear them at all. I slept like a log. My husband — let’s just say he was fully serenaded.

\- Evenings and mornings are very quiet, so it's easier to fall asleep and sleep in!  
\- How people react when they hear about my disability gives me a pretty good indication of what they're like as people - if they don't make an effort to figure out how to communicate with me efficiently, chances are the connection isn't that worth pursuing anyway, so I've been able to weed out people not worth talking to based on how empathetic they are when they hear about my disability, so I have more energy to invest in connections that matter.  
\- I have an excuse to get out of phone calls which made me extremely anxious even before I started losing my hearing, and I communicate via email instead, which is much more convenient to me and also gives me a paper trail for important decisions/adulting stuff.  
\- When watching a movie with someone, people are much more accommodating about putting on subtitles.

\- Removing my hearing aids and putting on headphones with some music or a podcast gives me really good quiet time without distractions.",2025-03-23 07:03:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jhtj0v/feel_like_im_going_crazy_so_please_tell_me/

Advice/help.","I’m a 22 year old about to graduate with a music ed degree, and I’m losing my hearing in my right ear. Pretty severely, I attached the test. It’s gotten significantly worse in the past two years. I’m so scared that it’s going to continue to get worse, and I’ve read some things that say aids make music harder to listen to, is this true? Is there a brand I can get that won’t make this happen? Singing and teaching is my whole life, I’m getting a masters degree in vocal pedagogy. 

I’m reading stories of people who begin to sing out of tune, or can’t identify when people sing out of tune. Is this true for a lot of people? This can’t happen to me, if it does, I don’t have a career. I’m so scared, does anyone have any stories of successfully continuing a career in music, or music education, with hearing loss? 

[댓글]
Have you seen an ENT about this? A big asymmetry like that really needs to be checked out in case there’s a medical cause for it.

That's an extremely asymmetrical PTA. this usually comes with cochlear dead zones and/or diplacusis (hearing out of tune or time) I'd advise a detailed ENT check.

I'm sorry for what you're going through, not many people would be able to comment if you could keep your career or not. I'd try to avoid toxic positivity but you're very young, you have a whole life ahead of you and things can change. Don't give up.

All I can say is: I'm HOH, but am interested in music theory. I'm currently learning to play 3 instruments. It sucks having private tutors unaware of how to interact and/or teach me in a way that's accessible and understandable to me.




There's an audience out there for you to teach, whether they're fully hearing or not. Don't count yourself out of your goals just yet please.

Closed window, opened door. Deaf education needs music teachers. No, I'm not joking.

I also found out that I was losing my hearing (meniere's) at the end of my music ed degree. Now, I'm a successful band director! I have had to reinvent some of the ways I run things in my classroom, but I've had a lot of success with hearing aids at my level of hearing loss (moderate/severe bilateral).

My audiologist suggests Widex aids for musicians, and I love mine. I'm learning ASL and honestly, my experience has helped me to be a better teacher. I can understand and connect with deaf and HoH students in a way that other teachers can't. 

No real advice, other than - if you want to continue to be involved in music, you absolutely can. Things may look a little different, but sometimes different is good. I'm happy to answer any questions or share more, if you want!

I’m so sorry you’re having to face these questions when you should be looking forward to using your degree. 

Hearing aids have lots of capabilities these days, and working with someone who understands your hearing and your concerns will be essential for you. Mine have always had multiple programmed settings options for different settings, so it may be possible for you to have a setting that allows you to work with vocal students. 

Other than listening to music in the car, my experience with music these days is mostly at church. With my current hearing aids, we tried to maximize my hearing for conversation, but it distorted music. That’s been mostly resolved, but it took multiple trips and fine tuning. I can tell if I’m singing off key or if the pianist hits a C# instead of C when she’s practicing, but handbells are still clangy and uncomfortable for me to listen to. I’m willing to take that trade off because the bell choir doesn’t play often and I’m usually far enough from them when they do play that the discordance is easier to tolerate. 

I hope you’re able to find a positive way through this. It’s a lot to deal with.

Hard of hearing. Graduated with my music ed degree 12 years ago. That being said I was born hard of hearing but my hearing aids don’t make it hard. It’s an adjustment - every new pair I get takes my brain 2 weeks to recalibrate and hear the new normal. You’ll get used to it but it may be jarring at first

There is Reddit group called /monohearing for single sided deafness. I believe I remember reading there are several people in the music industry on that site.

I just want to say that you can do it!

My family has hereditary hearing loss, I’m at a 55dB loss at 28. My dad is at 90 loss at 55, and my GMA at 70 is almost completely deaf. 

She always told me that we were blessed with musical souls and to not let my hearing loss get in the way. 

I played viola and piano all through high school, taking lessons and being first chair. My dad still plays in his rock punk band. (He’s so cool btw). 

There are technologies now that help us continue to do the things we love and are passionate about. Don’t let it hinder you :)

Can you feel the music? Like physically? If not you can train yourself now before/if it gets worse. It sounds a little crazy but it is actually a thing

Audiologist here. Widex is the go-to brand for nearly all audiologists fitting musicians.

I would love that hearing, cry 🥹

You have some bone conduction thresholds below 0 db? That’s odd. I have that but I have semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome. Look it up to see if you have any of the symptoms (hearing your eyeballs move, hearing your heartbeat, dizziness, and some others). You probably need additional testing. Maybe it is something that can be treated.

I love this sm

I love that list! I'm tempted to type that up and give it to people who know me, as it gets the point across in a more tactful way than I could.


Only for me, I'd add an 11th commandment- ""Thou shalt not use shoulder taps/pokes to get the person's attention."" (I have sensory issues, and prefer not to be touched.)

It should be the Ten Commandments of communication, with or without hearing loss.

Omg I'm going to make myself a copy!

Ohhhhh this reminds me how much I hate when people don't speak clearly and you ask them to repeat and they say ""Nevermind""

I WILL FOREVER MIND! DONT START WHAT YOU CANT FINISH.

Had a conversation with my now-wife on our first date about how sometimes I'll need her to repeat things she says and if she can't handle doing that without saying nevermind then we might as well give up now. We've been married for almost 10 years so clearly she can handle it 😀

I'm saving this list, I'm a phlebotomist float and I notice many of us struggle to communicate effectively with those hard of hearing.

I'm hanging this on my fridge

Great list

I think 2, 3 and 4 can me summed up by *Thou shalt speak face to face at all times*. (I can lip-read from the side though, so walking and talking is possible. But I can imagine that it's a rare skill?)

I'd like to add the following suggested amendments: (suggested or inspired by fellow commenters here, thanks!)

Thou shall not use touch to attract attention.

Thou can attract attention by calmly raising a hand in the field of view. Please do not stick a hand in front of face.

Thou shall repeat what was said if asked. (It's very rude and dismissive to say that it doesn't matter: it gives the idea that the other isn't worth repeating for—and if it really didn't matter please tell why)

Thou shalt not yell in ear in loud bars and clubs, instead face the other. (So they can lip-read, unless they ask for you to yell)

You know, despite never have had any kind of help with my hearing loss (it was dismissed!), the people around me use pretty much all these tips and tricks (naturally as far as I know). —Even the ones that don't want to acknowledge that I'm deaf 😅. 

Which is pretty awesome and also extremely indicative of how much hearing loss I *actually* have (despite the dismissal).

I was looking for a post like this when I came to this sub!

Great in theory.  Not real life though.

I wish folks would be so kind as to follow this guidance, but personally, I would not post these commandments in my home or workplace.

My hearing loss is my problem.

I also dislike the imperative voice. I do not like to be told what to do, and I avoid issuing commands to others.",2025-03-21 22:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jgt0zl/ten_commandments_for_communicating_with_the/

Hey, I had an accidental ear drum rupture from sneezing while holding my nose at like 6 years old. 

Dealt with multiple infections per year, hearing loss, pain, ringing, discharge.

I finally got surgery last year, they replaced the chain of bones in my ear with a titanium replacement. Surgery went well, anesthesia was fantastic lol. Best nap of my entire life. 

Healing took a long time, maybe 6 months or more before it was totally healed, but after 4 months I was out traveling and working without much issue. 

So glad I got the surgery, because now it’s like I never had the damage. Hearing is better, haven’t had an infection since the week before the surgery, it’s amazing. 

I highly suggest going to every appointment they schedule after the surgery because they will check to make sure it’s healing properly and take any additional measures to continue a successful recovery. 

Good luck on your surgery, it’s worth it! 

Ps, research your surgeon before hand if you’re nervous. I found my doctors seminars on YouTube and his published books, and it made me feel really confident about him, because I got to hear how knowledgeable he is on the subject. Dr Bassim was my surgeon

Hey, just found your post and wondered how it all went? I have a pre-op coming up for a possible ossiculoplasty (possible as they don’t actually know where the damage is following accident!).

That’s pretty normal, especially with processing issues. I’d keep track of it though for changes as it is at a place where if it gets worse it could become hearing loss, but for now I’d say auditory processing stuff makes sense, especially if the audiologist thinks so. APD can look like hearing loss. But to put it simply it’s a software issue while hearing loss is a hardware issue.

I had a similar audiogram 5 years ago (though mine didn't go up and down, not sure how to describe it but it was consistent at about 25db hearing loss until 4000 then dropped). My audiologist said the same as yours and I didn't really find it a big issue back then but everyone is different and is in different environments and if you have potentially have APD as well maybe you could get an assessment of that? That was one of the things suggested to me at the time and you can get activities to help you though they didn't work for me as it turns out mine was progressive hearing loss not APD.

Obviously I'm not an audiologist so take this with a grain of salt but they told me the same thing as you.",2025-03-19 19:02:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jf4spx/audiologist_says_my_loss_is_nothing_not_worth/

Go to an ENT again, no one here can replace medical advice. 

THAT SAID, remember “normal hearing”’ is a range. It’s plausible for both ears to be “normal” and one still better than the other. 

Speech recognition tests… here’s the thing, most hearing tests, and especially the word recognition portion with the white noise, they can be quite imperfect and some folks need a second time to get a few samples in and establish a baseline. The key is, is the hearing affecting you? (You find yourself asking people to repeat themselves, etc). 

Also, don’t go blasting the volume on those headphones my young’ snapper.

Go to an audiologist, not an ENT and get another hearing test

If one ear is perceiving high-frequency sounds differently, it might be worth getting a second opinion or a more specialized test.

If your hearing test came back normal but you’re still noticing issues, it could be something like hidden hearing loss or mild asymmetry that wasn’t detected. Background noise issues are really common, even for people with ‘normal’ hearing. You might want to get a more detailed test, like speech-in-noise testing or extended high-frequency audiometry.

Agree with other posters that you need to go to the audiologist for a proper hearing test. What sent me to the audiologist was someone standing about a foot away from me who was whispering and I saw her lips moving, but I did not hear a word she said. It’s possible that sound isn’t carrying correctly on the one side, but only a true hearing test Will confirm that (and what to be concerned about).",2025-03-17 06:10:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jd62x9/is_this_hearing_loss/

All I have to say is that people with ""normal"" hearing don't wonder if they're hard of hearing. Your anxiety is totally valid and normal, but it's also no reason to prevent yourself getting the care you need. The audiologists are probably super used to people being just as nervous as you feel now. Get the appointment, OP. You'll be okay. :)

Hearing can fluctuate as well.  When it comes to health it's best to know so you know how to best live a life with quality and not being overshadowed by this unknown. 

Go to an audiologist.

Online hearing tests are extremely unreliable, you need specialized equipment to test your hearing. 

The good thing about hearing tests on calibrated equipment, however, is that they are pretty objective - they starts sounds very quiet and then gradually make them louder until you can hear. There's no need to be ""believed"", it's an unambiguous test. Go to an audiologist, get your hearing tested, and find out.

They shouldn't make you feel like an imposter. I would call and ask to book a hearing test anyways, you can probably use email too since clientele are typically hearing disabled.

When I was 20 I got tested, &amp; the attendant was kinda like oh this must be a just in case thing. I shrugged it off then it turned out I had severe hearing loss and she was shocked. I don’t want hearing loss obviously but it was sorta nice to teach her a lesson. The numbers don’t lie &amp; shut her up quick lol. The actual doctor was really nice, I’ve been taken seriously ever since then 

So there could be a chance of some comment like this but I think my lady was unprofessional and not the standard

Online tests are crap in my experience. I tried heaps and they ranged from my hearing is totally fine to in certain ranges I'm profoundly deaf which I knew wasn't correct (I have moderate hearing loss). If you go to an audiologist they can test you properly. They ask questions but also do tests in a booth to see what's happening objectively.",2025-03-17 04:59:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jd51u0/possibly_hoh/
1jbqr6d,hardofhearing,Why do hearing people keep claiming they're trying to learn ASL when it's so obvious they're not trying at all?,"I genuinely appreciate all efforts to communicate with me in a way that doesn't rely on me using my residual hearing. I've learned better than expecting someone to learn ASL on my behalf, so I'll take whatever I can get and genuinely appreciate someone doing what they can to make a conversation NOT exhausting or confusing for me.

That doesn't stop the occasional ""I want to learn ASL"" or ""I'm trying to learn ASL"".

I have a supervisor who has shown genuine curiosity about ASL, asking questions (to either/both me and any interpreters I happen to have with me, when I have them), sharing short videos of ASL signs (from legit sources) on a language learning channel we have at our company, etc. They've even carved out time once a week to ""practice"" ASL.

So I slipped up thinking they were serious about trying to learn a few signs for my benefit. I felt genuinely shocked, yet appreciative. When will I learn?

I signed some basic signs \*to them, and they, not understanding what I signed, revealed they're only learning off an app. I didn't think they were taking a class or anything, but I thought they were at least using an online resource like Lifeprint. Semi long-form videos, you know?

Then they continuously chuckle when they say, ""I haven't learned to fingerspell yet"". Like it's a \*cute quirk that they ""struggle"" to learn it. They literally won't stop saying this whenever I ask them to repeat something. They'll repeat or write it down, then add it in (""I haven't learned to fingerspell yet heh heh"") like it's a running joke. I chuckled back the first time they said it (it CAN be difficult to memorize). But it's insulting now, because they still act like they're genuinely trying to learn.

I already told them just knowing how to fingerspell would be critical and more beneficial to me than learning signs I don't need from them like ""how are you?"" and ""good morning"" and whatnot. So it's not about providing me accessibility then if you can't learn a minimum of 26 handshapes.

Just a small vent, because I'm not really mad, just mildly annoyed. It amazes me meeting adults who're so lazy and immature about language learning, truly trying to be an ally/accessibility advocate, etc.

\*edit to clarify/add a few words

[댓글]
If they were being serious the apps can be helpful for a lot of things, so can YouTube; I had a coworker who went from speaking solely Spanish to speaking Spanish and English thanks to YouTube videos. Their lack of effort is definitely disappointing though.

Learning asl has a road block, that there's hardly anyone available for practicing and that is a big burden for new language pickup

I think a lot of hearing people don't really have the cultural understanding that ASL is, you know... a language, in the same way English or Spanish is. Learning it is like saying you're going to start jogging, it *sounds* good and simple and then you actually start and are like ""wow, this is actually work!"" It's especially hard to learn if you don't have someone to converse with regularly - I took an eight week online course with Oklahoma School for the Deaf and really only retained the alphabet and a few basic verbs.

I’m not sure why. Most of my family didn’t bother to learn until a cousin got a deaf dog that knew: sit, stop, speak and eat on ASL. They all put in the effort to learn. 

(My therapist realllllyyyyy earned her check the week they told me they learned random verbs for a dog, but couldn’t sign my name. )

I have a Deaf tutor and take weekly classes. I watch a lot of YouTube and have a few other Deaf folks I sign with. After three years…I have a long way to go. 

My hearing is getting progressively worse and I’ll likely be fully reliant on ASL one day. No one bothers to learn and it’s not my job (or place) to teach. I will believe it when they put there money where their mouth (hands?) is. Get into it.

I recommend ASLDeafined when my students want to spend time learning outside of school. It’s made by Deaf Individuals and lists what hand shape every sign uses, so it returns all lessons back to hand shapes. It may not help you immediately but maybe you can suggest a learning tool from within the community as a last ditch effort (not that it should be your job, the situation sucks and I’m sorry about the experience you’re having)

Thank you. For making me think about this again.

For years I've been wondering why I felt icked out by an acquaintance who was over-excited about learning ASL and now, while reading and typing this it reminds me of the time that kids (peers) I knew were learning Japanese for fun because of anime. They had that same over-excitement that was over the top and bordered on kink or fanatical? Can't find a proper word for it &gt;_&lt; (help?)

I think it was because they treated it like a gimmick or entertainment? Doing that about culture that isn't yours (yet) feels really icky sticky. 

My point:
Stuff like that isn't a joke, yet people kind of treat it like one, like it's just for fun. 
I don't know ASL but I've had to ""hands and feet speak"" (as I call it) enough to understand/feel that it's no joke. 


As to your question: I think your analogy to running is accurate. It's (like) a hobby for them, while it's a vital tool for you. They don't get it because they've never NOT been able to communicate. 
Perhaps you can get your point across by having a meeting without talking. By having *them* be ""unable"" to speak, it certainly hammered down the point for me (when I was unable to speak).

Hopefully I'm making sense?

Unfortunately I think this is indicative of our current culture structured around app/game based learning - one of my best friends has been ""learning german"" for 3 years and he took one evening class and then has been on apps. We travelled to germany two years ago and he was able to do basically no communicating at all because the way apps teach language is relatively useless.

Finger spelling for me is the hardest. I can do it but receiving it is another thing entirely. I’m HoH, deaf in my left ear, mild loss in my right. I know how to finger spell but when someone finger spells at me I don’t take it in. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It’s easier for me to recognize a single sign than to take in the spelling of a world and translate it in my head. Also, people who are fluent, first language ASL signers finger spell soooo damn fast! I mean as they should, but I could see for a beginner feeling like an idiot for not being able to quickly pick up on that. I dunno. When I worked for my last company they paid for me to take two asl classes and I was always asking my deaf asl teacher to repeat stuff she finger spelled to me. To me that’s the hardest part. ❤️🥺

I agree that learning ASL is super difficult, especially if you’re not very involved with your local deaf community due to access, lack of frequency of events, etc. I’m in my late 30s and am still a beginner.
However, OP’s supervisor does have a duty to provide an accessible environment for them. It may not be learning ASL, because obviously a lot of hearing people don’t care to learn it. But it needs to be something.

I completely get how frustrating that can be. It gets tiresome to get the same comments from people about wanting to learn but they never do. I have an interpreter friend who I work with often. We had a discussion about this recently because she has the same issue. Hearing people see her interpreting and ask questions and say they want to learn and expect her to teach them. She doesn't mind mentoring those that are serious but it's hard to filter out the time wasters from the ones who really do and asked for suggestions.

Generally, in most cases, I just ignore the comment. Most people that say that to me are people I may rarely if ever see again and they are just making the comment to make themselves feel good. For anyone that appears more serious, I direct them to Lifeprint. It's free so all it take is time and the motivation to learn. If when you see them again they actually show they learned something then that would be someone to recognize as really wanting to learn to sign.

In your case, it seems even more annoying since this is someone you work with and see regularly. It is particularly tough because of the dynamics of someone at a higher level doing this. Someone already suggested to stop laughing which I agree with so it doesn't seem like you are finding it funny too. I don't really have any solutions for how to do this since it doesn't seem to rise to the point of a complaint to HR. It's just a irritating work scenario and I can commiserate with that experience.

I’m learning asl because I’m deaf and new to everything. I signed up for a class run by deaf people and already know how to finger spell, people who just say they’re going to learn but put in 0 effort are just performative and don’t actually want to put in the effort to be accommodating. It’s annoying and bullshit

I really connect with this. Ive been hard of hearing since birth. First of all I’m really sorry you’re dealing with a supervisor of all people. Someone who is in a position of authority. They have the ability to be accessible and to create an accessible environment. But it seems he’s choosing not to. This is a really disappointing fact for the deaf. A good amount of hearing people around us don’t care to make any effort besides the empty promises. A lot of people have good intentions of course, but when they see how difficult it can be to learn, the effort goes down.
Blah. I loathe this for you.

You state: I genuinely appreciate all efforts to communicate with me in a way that doesn't rely on me using my residual hearing. I've learned better than expecting someone to learn ASL on my behalf, so I'll take whatever I can get and genuinely appreciate someone doing what they can to make a conversation NOT exhausting or confusing for me.

If you really want a simpler way to communicate with your coworkers then you should consider learning Cued Speech with them.  I know it is nearly universally detested by the deaf but you are not trying to communicate with deaf people.  With cued speech everyone is speaking a language that they are fluent in, most likely their native tongue, and it only takes a month or two to become proficient.  You can actually start communicating almost immediately albeit really slowly.  Still it's better to communicate slowly than not communicate at all, or even worse miscommunicate.",2025-03-15 08:39:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jbqr6d/why_do_hearing_people_keep_claiming_theyre_trying/

1jbf69a,hardofhearing,"There are no ""BEST"" hearing aids","Ok...

I'm going to make a simple, clear, strong statement. 

There's NO SUCH THING AS A ""BEST"" HEARING AID. Stop asking.

There are SO many variables that go into a recommendation.  Some are good and some are just business (tbh).

1. Brand affiliations- brands want market share. They learn a long time ago that one easy way to get it is to give a licensed person money to open an office in return for a commitments that theyll get xx% of their business.

2. Hearing Healthcare provider's knowledge, familiarity with, and preference for certain brand(s).
  A. They understand/prefer the software
  B. They like the rep
  C. They get marketing money from them
  D. They got free stuff from them and are now obligated (see #1)
NOTE: Honestly....it's usually best to go with the brand that your HHP is most familiar with.

3. The HHP is, simply, too lazy to keep up to date on all options.  This is akin to your Dr not keeping up on meds available for your condition.

4. The brands release their new products at different times, so they're all the ""it product"" at some point in the year.

5. Utter, complete lack of following best practices in their office and, instead, relying on their salesmanship.
  A. An HHP should do a thorough lifestyle assessment in addition to the testing so they know what you want to hear better.  EG. Selling someone expensive hearing aids/features that enable better conversation in crowds....when they're homebound and just want to hear TV....but NOT selling them a TV adapter. 🤔😔
  B.  PEOPLE!! Educate yourself on this.



There is no ""best"" hearing aid.  There is only the one that is best suited to your needs and preferences....

[댓글]
100000% with you on this one. Brand doesn't matter, what matters is what you need according to your degree of hearing loss. I stay away from hearing aid places *cough* miracle ear *cough* that have become more about the sale than the benefit of the patient.

Thank you!!  This is the way.

Hearing aid dispensers and AuD's alike have become complacent, greedy, lazy, and negligent.

1jbalcc,hardofhearing,Workplace Harassment? Am I protected?,"
Hi, I have had hearing loss all my life in just my right ear due to trauma. I was deaf in that ear for two years (ages 2-4) but then I received a prosthetic implant to improve and regain most of my hearing. Unfortunately the prosthetic over the last 26 years has degraded/failed and now I have moderately severe hearing loss in one ear. 

The last few years my life has been *somewhat* severely impacted as I ask people to repeat themselves often, or I turn my head so my good ear can hear. I hardly ever used to tell people I was hard of hearing and now it’s clear that being hearing impaired is a big part of my life and identity. 

I recently was in a workplace training where people nearby me were talking over the presenter and I couldn’t hear them due to the jumble of noise. I told them I am hearing impaired and asked them to talk less while the presenter was talking. 

I don’t usually have to ask this of people at work events like this because I’m a teacher and most teachers I’m around are at least somewhat considerate of people presenting. 

These teachers took me asking them to quiet down very negatively and the next day one of them tracked me down and told me off. She told me to sit at another table or by myself if I can’t hear and that I should disclose my hearing impairment every time I meet a new group of people (I don’t like to do that always, nor should I have to). She also said they are adults and they can talk if they want. The general vibe was being very dismissive and offensive to my reasonable request of them, and that they shouldn’t be inconvenienced by my difference. 

It felt like borderline harassment and it was extremely upsetting to me, I wasn’t able to teach my last class of the day as a result (I was crying). 

My concern in going to my supervisor about this is that I haven’t disclosed to them that I have an impairment. I am able to do my job well but I do ask students to repeat themselves and my students know about my hearing and try to accommodate me when I tell them to quiet down. 

I have proven myself to be capable in this position certainly, and perform the job duties for the last two years, but unfortunately I only work half time at my school and I have been *verbally* offered a full time job at the same (public) school, teaching a different subject next year. I feel relatively certain this is going to happen but I haven’t signed anything yet. 

I worry they will reconsider if I can perform the role well upon learning this about me. I don’t think that to be the case because my principal and VP are good people but it’s in the back of my mind. I also worry that if I raise this issue I will be seen as causing drama in the workplace and even though that is evidently not the case here, I fear it could be considered that way and it will impact my ability to attain full time employment.

I did some reading and it seems that the ADA may not classify unilateral hearing loss as a disability unless it is deafness or extremely severe? (Again mine is moderately severe). 

Am I still protected even if I am not under the official “disabled” umbrella as described by the govt? 

I’m sorry this is so long I’m very troubled by this recent experience and thought I would join this community, thank you 

[댓글]
Let's set aside the hearing loss for a second: you politely asked someone to quiet down because they were chatting in the middle of a presentation, and they responded by angrily telling you off. That is immature and confrontaltional behavior that should be corrected regardless of any disability. 

&gt; She told me to sit at another table or by myself if I can’t hear and that I should disclose my hearing impairment every time I meet a new group of people

What an absolute child. 

Regarding the disability classification, the other commenter's suggestion of talking to your union is a good one. My gut says you're protected but they would know better. 

Also, have you looked into getting your implant fixed? They might be able to get it working again.

You are totally covered under the ADA. Where does it say you are not?

Do you have a teachers union?

I am not sure of the protection. I would answer keeping in mind feigning concern for others and say “I know I am struggling to hear with all the side chatter, and I imagine others might be to. Would it be possible to ask for quiet when you’re presenting so everyone can follow along.” The instructor is ridiculous with what she said.",2025-03-14 18:26:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1jbalcc/workplace_harassment_am_i_protected/
1jb36tx,hardofhearing,Upcoming canalplasty question,"Long story short, my ENT doctor has recommended surgery for my left ear due to a large osteoma that is in there. I actually can hear fine, but do get infections and wax build up. I've never had surgery before and I'm honestly very nervous. Any tips to calm me down? I'm scared of the anesthesia too as well as not being able to hear out of that ear well after the procedure. 

My surgery has not been scheduled yet. It's been a week and the surgery scheduler still hasn't called me but maybe they've just been busy. 

[댓글]
For the other stuff, going under is always scary. So I recommend focusing on deep breathing and keeping a steady best. And for the not hearing part it has to heal first.

Take deep breath, shake arms and legs, jump. Do fast body movements. All of those things help revive your body of the high anxiety/stress. You will feel calmer, more level headed.  

Sounds like this surgery is just one where you can leave and not stay at a hospital?

They should call you in advance of the surgery to do a pre-appointment conversation. They’ll ask questions about your overall health, who’s accompanying you, things like that. Be honest with them. Tell them you are nervous, that you haven’t had surgery before. Not only should that person be able to answer questions, they should mark it on your record, so the staff knows when you arrive. Don’t hesitate to mention it to the nurse who does your pre-op stuff. You won’t be the first person they’ve encountered who is scared. I told a nurse I was nervous before my first colonoscopy, and every single person who entered the room treated me with kindness and compassion, carefully explaining what they were going to do and checking with me repeatedly to make sure I was comfortable. Honestly, it makes *their* work easier if *we* feel comfortable. 

Anesthesia, in my experience, means a really good nap. One I usually wish would last longer. 😁 Depending on your body, the type of anesthesia, and the length of the procedure, it can take a day or two up to a couple weeks to stop feeling the effects of it. For me, that’s mostly sluggishness and needing more sleep. Some people have nausea afterwards, so they’ll probably be careful about reintroducing food and water. The nurse who calls you to do the pre-op conversation should be able to help with this, and the anesthesiologist should visit you prior to surgery, as well. They should be willing to answer any questions you have. 

Please remember: IT IS NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT SOMETHING NEW. Nor is it a weakness to have anxiety about medical procedures.

Right away I felt like it was obstructed when it wasn't. 
I thought maybe it got very sensible and ask the doctor to take a second look.
She cleaned it with a gauze, said it had only a little skin there but otherwise no wax.
I came home and hours later can still feel like there is an obstruction there, I did the hearing test, it came back very good and indeed I'm hearing fine but the sensation is so annoying!
Does anyone knows if after cleaning this sensation is normal to feel? Should I use something? She didn't prescribed anything

Yes, my left ear was stuffed up and also had backed up fluid. It sort of felt relieved after the procedure, but for 2 or 3 days that ear drained all the fluid I had trapped in my ear. It took a good couple weeks for the sensation to go away and rn my left ear seems as good as my right ear. It's very annoying feeling, I hope you recover soon.

I had the “full,” feeling for MANY years. I also suffered with frequent ear infection and hearing loss. 9 months ago, at age 44, my ENT put tubes in my ears. I went from having 9ish infections to 1 ear infection during my window. **The reason I have one right now is because they fell out*** Getting them back in once my ruptured eardrum heals.

You may have an abrasion in the ear canal, so you could ask your doctor for antibiotic eardrops

[댓글]
Yes, I’ve had mine for 3 weeks and I’m in love. I have Jabar pro from Costco bought in August 2024 and it’s been one thing after another. They can’t get them right. They’ve even replaced them and still not right. This was my second pair of jabar hearing aids. I only got new ones because of the improvements in technology. Well it hasn’t worked out. I’ve watched many YouTube videos and decided to give ELEHEAR beyond a try. I am so happy now. It’s amazing. To me there is nothing like being able to hear, without having to ask someone to repeat or having something extra loud. These ELEHEAR HA are so great. I paid $411, not $1500 like at Costco.

They have been really good with streaming and my iPhone through Bluetooth. Not hard to set up either. There’s also a 45 day try-out time.

I've got 1000 hours of use on mine and love them. Did you pull the trigger?

I have a couple pairs of these. I did really like them and they were great at the phone and streaming. However, the left one started having issues after a few weeks. It was cutting out and turning off and just started to fail. They did replace it for free. The warranty is a limited one year and only 45 days for free replacement. After that it's $40 each time to cover postage or something. The replacement hearing aid also started failing after a few weeks and doing pretty similar things to the first one. Then they wouldn't pair properly, and yes, I did it several times. My phone and computer wouldn't stream to them as a pair, so even if you hooked both of them up, there is a lag, so really you can only use one for streaming anything. I read a bunch of reviews and it seems they do have a quality control issue as there are many complaints now. At first they were so great and now the other one will hold a charge only part of the day. I did buy another version of the beyond and they are still working, but I can't recommend them much. The older pair I am just going to toss as I don't trust that the replacements will last very long.",2025-03-12 22:59:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j9xfee/has_anyone_tried_elehearing_beyond_aid/
1j7obje,hardofhearing,Lack of enunciation,"Mostly just here to rant, but why does it seem like so many people struggle to speak clearly? I don’t have the expectation for the world to abide to my HoH struggles, but at the same time this feels like a basic skill. The amount of people who either mumble, slur their words or speak too quickly is frustrating and limits my desire to be in any social setting. Similarly, if you ask someone to repeat themselves, you’re often met with the exact same tone as the first time they spoke.

I’m not sure if I’m just more aware of this, but I always make an active effort towards enunciating sentences properly, adjusting my tone to match background noise etc.

Its become exhausting, I feel dumb when I don’t understand people and a sense of disconnect from truly engaging in social settings.

I feel exactly the same.

I have told several people that I didn’t need them to speak louder but more clearly. Not exaggerating, just enunciating clearly.

I've managed get some people to be more clear by asking them to say it again like an Englishman villain.

For some damnedest reason, people think the English accent is simply enunciating better.

one of my best friends ive literally had to stop hanging around as much, she knows I have hearing loss and she’s literally the worst mumbler and speaks so quietly it’s crazy and she gets so pissed if I ask her repeat so I stopped even asking after a while. it’s like you know my hearing loss is progressive it’s only gonna get worse

even just last week I was stood with 2 friends and she had mumbled something and I asked for a repeat twice before saying i don’t get what your saying can you say it more clearly and she just *mumbled* doesn’t matter so I had to ask my other friend to tell me which she did and I got it straight away😭

I'm not shy about sharing my hearing situation info. I cup my ear and lean forward. I ask for a repeat. But if someone is a mumbler, i give up right away.

i’ve had to remind even my bf that just bc i have my hearing aids in and on, does not mean i can hear a whisper or him mumbling. they do not unmumble words for me. he still does have to speak clearly and towards me 😭 its 100000% easier to hear him now and i can hear sounds when he whispers something as opposed to not hearing any noise at all when he’d whisper before my ha’s but like u still have to speak clear for me 😭😭😭
i’m in charge of a small group for my jazz band class and i ask that like if someone has a q to pls not play so i can hear it. they do it for maybe 5 minutes then its back to ppl playing over it. just bc i have them in and on does not mean i can hear over the instruments! reading lips only goes so far in both of these situations

I’ve resorted to asking people to speak as if I am not an English language speaker. For some reason they speak slower and more clearly then. 

Ironically, if I didn’t speak English their efforts at enunciation would be useless. 🤦‍♂️

Honey...they sound like that to you because of your hearing loss.

1j6zcgj,hardofhearing,Lip-reading accents,"Are you able to tell someone's accent from lip-reading alone? I've been noticing that I can do this with Instagram videos that play with sound off and if it's an account I'm not familiar with. Accents from the American South, and British accents.

[댓글]
Yeah, it's also why I immediately know if someone's not speaking with their natural accent in a way that they're not good at (like I can't see it on hugh laurie but I absolutely can on tom ellis, for example). 

It's also why I can't watch animation, bc the lipreading doesn't ever match the words as close as it would for actual people

Depends on the accent and whether I have subtitles. If it’s one I’m familiar with and I have subtitles, then I can pick it out fairly well. I will usually hear it in my head; this means that even though I can’t name all the British accents, I can still differentiate them on the lips. For accents I’m less familiar with I still get features but it’s not always as accurate. I can also hear people’s lisps and other distinctive speech features just by looking at them. This accuracy requires me to know what they’re supposed to be saying. 

If I don’t have subtitles I can sometimes pick up on the fact that it’s not a North American accent, but my lip-reading is pretty rubbish without sound so I don’t quite get phonemes. In this case it’s more just that I’ll recognize the overall mouth-movements as vaguely British but I can’t hear it in my head. I can see lisps without subtitles.

Never thought about this but yes! I’ve been lip reading since infancy. I’d like to tell people that watching some shows is like watching Godzilla movies. ( if you know, you know).

Before I lost my hearing, I spent 12 hours a day transcribing medical reports. I learned the earmarks of certain accents by the sounds they were unable to pronounce well. I can also ""see"" those accents when lip-reading.

ohhh yes definitely.

Enough to throw off my lip reading when I first encounter it until I figure out their 'pattern'.

Annoyingly, southern accent throws me off the most.

I've noticed that if a person has filler in their lips, then their lips don't move as they should, they just go up down down like a puppet.

Yep! Sure can!!

I have the opposite experience. I grew up in southeastern Kentucky and I find it easier to lip read people who speak with that kind of dialect. Now that I've lived more northern for quite a few years, I'm approximately as skilled at lip reading the people here but it won't ever feel as natural as Appalachian accents. When it comes to British and other foreign accents, I struggle pretty heavily. If I *have* to communicate with somebody who has a strong accent and they can't (or won't) basically yell at me, I usually ask them to write it down or use text to speech on their phone.

I can do this, and I figured it out the same way as you! It’s fascinating. Feels like a superpower, albeit one I have no use for lol",2025-03-09 04:10:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j6zcgj/lipreading_accents/

Hard of hearing at the doctors office, deaf socially because that makes more sense to the general public

deaf is a spectrum. Most of the time, I’m HH. In a bustling coffee shop or the Costco food court, I’m deaf. Please, visually notify me when my order is ready because I can’t hear the announcement.

Tl;Dr My point is—if you don't hear people, cars, doorbells, whatever, to the point that it's negatively affecting your life and you're finding yourself compensating and missing out on life I'd call you deaf, just like other people called me deaf (even if mockingly).


I would definitely call it deaf. It might not be literally 0% hearing, but it's functionally deaf.

If you wanted to call it Deaf (big D Deaf) however, I wouldn't know as I'm not part of the Deaf community.

If you can't hear someone talking behind your back, at your side (or without looking at them) I'd say you're deaf, and other people will call you deaf—even if it's just to be nasty. 

I've been deaf since I was ±7. Over the years many people have asked me if I was deaf—in a nasty way ""Didn't you hear me, are you deaf!?"". Enough times that I became a smarty-pants about it and answered the yelling in my ear with a ""Yes, so!?"". My hearing isn't even nowhere near as bad as yours and yet I couldn't finish high school because of it—I couldn't hear the teachers so I missed too much info. Trying to compensate was so exhausting I was dead tired halfway the schoolday and people refused me the help I needed (I hadn't mastered lip-reading enough yet I guess, I never got any kind of support or even acknowledgement and didn't find out untill my early 20s how deaf I actually was, not by test but by the fact how well I could lip-read).

Edit: I actually say ""I can't hear you"" when I can't *see* people so I'd say hearing through seeing is valid and doesn't need ""hear"", if you're noticing sound through other means than your ears I'd call that hearing too.

Ps, this is just my personal opinion and experience, you do you 😉

severe hearing loss makes someone deaf therefore if you have severe hearing loss then you’re classified as deaf.

Deafness is a spectrum. I have always identified myself as Hard of Hearing. However, as I have been learning more about deafness, I have started to consider identifying myself as deaf. I have severe hearing loss and I’m completely lost in loud situations. Plus, I do think that the general public would understand it more. People don’t seem to understand what being “Hard of Hearing” entails, so saying that “I’m deaf” might help more.

I'm HH, wear hearing aids, since my hearing loss is profound; I call myself deaf. In social situations, I rely heavily on lip reading and contect clues. I'm lucky to have a circle that understands my needs and privileged to be confident to advocate for myself when I am in new spaces, etc.

TLDR: Whilst I identify as deaf I use different terms in different situations. It makes a difference to how I’m treated.

I consider myself little d deaf. I’ve medically got a profound or severe/ profound loss in both ears and functionally in terms of communication/ speech I can’t understand much without using a speech to text app / sign etc. I also can’t use hearing aids etc.

The only places I’d use the term Hard of hearing is with Capital D Deaf people, because I still have a small amount of residual hearing despite it being pretty useless in the grand scheme of things. Oh and with an ENT doctor / audiologist who has a greater understanding between d/Deaf &amp; HoH.

I’ve found terminology can make a big difference in how I’m treated by others.
For example recently I had a medical appointment, things were fine with the Dr but when the nurse came in I could tell she was obviously speaking louder, slower etc. This made speech to text difficult and lip reading almost impossible. Eventually I said to her “Sorry I don’t mean to be rude but I’m deaf, it sounds silly but volume isn’t really the issue, talking louder slower can just make things more difficult”. Her response? “Oh my god I’m so sorry the dr said you were hard of hearing, you know like an elderly person? When people lose their hearing due to age often talking slower and louder matched with their hearing aids is the best thing. If you’re deaf it wouldn’t make a difference”. The nurse then either spoke into the mic making speech to text easier or wrote stuff down. Situations like that are really common in my experience.

Former interpreting student here.

I got into the asl courses because my child is HoH. When I would tell the Deaf community my child is HoH, my two (Deaf) teachers would tell me to stop qualifying it because HoH is on the deaf spectrum.

On the rare occasion that someone asks “what are you deaf?!” 

“Yes”

This sounds like it is more to do with how you feel inside 
 Your heart. 

I know many Deaf people but they feel more inclined with little d deaf than actual D deaf. Even though they are completely deaf themselves. 

What you have being that serve/profound deaf is different than how you feel in your heart. 

There is no right or wrong in this regards it's all about you finding that piece of peace of where you stand when it comes to this. 

I wish you the best.

I appreciate this conversation. When my hearing loss was diagnosed, I just wore my hearing aids and volumed them up to high if I couldn’t hear someone. Now I find myself telling people immediately that I am hard of hearing and they have to speak louder than usual. I am otherwise giving them permission not to support my disability. I’m not a great lip reader yet. But I’m trying.

Deaf with a capital D typically means Deaf to the point of belonging in the Deaf community - typically totally deaf, but not always so. Deaf with a lowercase d is indicative of the spectrum of deafness. Being deaf is not that same as being Deaf, but they do both fit with the deaf spectrum

Same situation for me, I have profound hear loss, I call myself HoH but socially I say deaf because if I say HoH most except me to be able to hear without lip reading, to hear doorbells, to be able to communicate by phone…I can’t, and I’m tired of explaining it so I just say deaf. 

It’s like being legally blind, sure it’s not all black, they can see lights and some things but it’s severe enought to have a big impact on everyday life.

Because I qualify for bilateral cochlear implants, I am beyond HoH. This is deaf territory to me. I now feel more comfortable calling myself deaf. It took until the high frequency audiogram for me to accept it.",2025-03-08 19:34:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j6ozdi/deaf_or_not/
1j6o4fr,hardofhearing,Switching to ear molds,"I got castings done for new ear molds last week, I’m moving from vented domes to skeleton molds. Any tips I should know about or suggestions on caring for them?

[댓글]
Welcome to not feeling anything in your ears and zero feedback. Molds are amazing. They will fit great, sound better, not have any feedback, and never get itchy. Just keep them clean and thats pretty much all you have to do.

Do not pull them out by the wire. Grasp the actual mold to remove them

I know you posted this a few days ago. I have them now after having domes for a bit. I literally picked them up yesterday.

I have no cons yet, but they do feel better. Less itchy. I have a very small canal and the audiologist said I couldn’t have a skeleton. I’ve had them in the past, so I’m unsure what’s that about. 

All in all, the molds are better.",2025-03-08 18:56:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j6o4fr/switching_to_ear_molds/
1j59y7c,hardofhearing,Help: Best responses to people being rude about your hearing loss,"New to the sub, sorry if this has been asked before. I'm having a hard time standing up for myself at work and need help with what to say when people are being inconsiderate or rude about my hearing loss. I think a lot of people don't even realize what they are doing. I have moderate to severe hearing loss and I wear hearing aids. People will sneak up on my or scare me. They'll do the classic ""What? What? What?"" when I try to talk to them. I'll get laughed at when I mishear something. I'm sick of being told to be more 'situationally aware'. People seem to think it's funny or in the last example, they think they are giving me genuine advice. What are some things you've said or done that stop the nonsense or is this something I just need to deal with? I got diagnosed at 8 but it still gets me even as an adult.

  
UPDATE: I spoke with HR and they gave the coworker who was the worst a written warning and they are bringing in a company do to an inclusivity training. I'm not holding my breath, but hopefully, these things will lead to positive change!

I have found the direct approach to be very effective. Stand up straight, look them right in the eye, and ask them why they think it is OK to make jokes about your disability. 

I've only had to do it once. It never happened again.

HR. You are being harassed. Have a meeting. Follow up with an email. Start a paper trail.

I think as difficult as it might be for you to do. It would be best if you just bluntly tell them how rude or upsetting this behaviour is. Lots of people are simply just unaware of how hard living with hearing loss is. I’ve a profound loss in both ears and people often creep up behind me or tell me to pay attention, alternatively they go completely the other way and say it doesn’t matter when I ask them to repeat themselves. I find when confronting people they tend to either say they forget I’m deaf / play everything down (blaming my good speech).
In some cases I find simply not talking and making people write stuff down easier.

I was picked on and constantly harassed in highschool because of my hearing loss. I'm severely HOH but don't wear hearing aids. I always got the, ""turn up your Beltone."" This continued probably into my mid to late 20s. I'm 36 now and very seldom do I have anyone poking fun anymore. I think most people mature. However, there's always ones who don't. I've had co-workers who make remarks and I just rattle off some insults right back and then threaten to go to HR and have their job. Hang in there.

The thing to keep in mind is they ain't your friends. They are just people you work with. I would talk them follow up with an email summarizing what y'all talked about. And keep doing that each time they do something like you have stated. And email. That is your paper trail. 

They ain't your friends they don't respect you, to bluntly put. 

Sucks that you have to deal with it but it will get worse as time goes on.

Agree with previous poster, ask the person why they feel comfortable mocking a person's disability.  Dead stare, just ask and wait.  I've had family members do this, thinking it's funny ( I truly believe there was no malice).   I have done this twice, and it's never happened again.  I honestly think people can't see the disability so it's easy to down play it.  No one would mock a person with one leg or one eye.

Stand up for yourself, let them be known not to take your hearing loss as a weakness. If it continues,HR is your next step, the world doesn’t know how to deal with hearing loss but they automatically assume it’s a mental illness.

You need to tell them ‘I don’t appreciate you making fun of me for a disability and if it doesn’t stop I will be speaking to HR and taking this further’ 

Then inform HR just so that they are aware it’s been happening and you’ve asked the person to stop

I get people who do the 'what, what, what' thing with a hand cupped to their ear. I tell them, ""Hearing loss is no laughing matter..."" then extend that with whatever I feel like at the time. Sometimes it's, ""Do you know how many times I've heard that in my life? It ceased to be funny a long time ago."" (I have a severe hearing loss.)  Other times it's, ""Why do you think that's funny? It's not. I didn't ask for a hearing loss.""

Being 'situationally aware' is kind of like the reply, ""Pay attention!"" There are 3 Golden Rules to hearing loss: get my attention, face me and be within 6 feet. If you don't do that, it's a guaranteed full repeat. When communication breaks down, I can usually trace it to one, or all 3, of the guidelines not being followed. I can't do my part, unless you do your part. I wrote more about it here because I got tired of saying it over and over.

 [https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/)

If this is happening at work its time to tell your boss and if they don’t straighten it out go to HR. Don’t let your boss try to downplay it either.

You don’t deserve this nonsense. My favorite approach is “I don’t get why that’s funny. Can you explain it to me?” And then watch them crumble.

I had a situation this year at work. I’m a teacher and dismissal can be tough with all the noise. Another teacher got upset with me one day for not hearing a students name over the walkie. In front of the entire gymnasium she made a comment like “oh, right, you can’t hear or help because you’re a deaf person” which shocked me.

I let my boss know, and then I asked to speak with the other teacher about this directly. In that meeting, I let her know why her comments were not only inappropriate but seriously harmful. It didn’t make me feel better, though, because I know that’s the narrative for so many hearing individuals. 

So in response, I started a sign language program at the school, and we focus as much on deaf culture as we do language and syntax. The kids are spreading the awareness more quickly than I ever could. 

Idk what the point of this is other than to say, people are shitty about what they haven’t experienced, and you have every right to be angry and upset and take further action.

ohhhh boy ... 

so personal experiences and im going to flat out say if my home office ever sees this .. enjoy the laugh ... 

So i work retail for a large company (W) and one day was on cash and the following occurred ...   
was serving the customer and finished ringing every thing up she had leaned over to look in her purse 

me- Will that be everything today ... \*no response\*  
me- Will that be everything ?   
Customer \*suddenly pops up\* - I said yes what are you deaf ?  
me- \*yanks hearing aid out, holds it up and says as loudly as possible while pointing at the HUGE tag i wore\* why yes i am deaf will that be everything today ???   
at this point the whole front end is now staring because of how loudly i said it and the fact i LITERALLY wear a vest that says \*Hard of hearing Happy to help\* she turned beet red and stormed out  leaving her cart in front of me ... .

  
Other ones i have had 

manager got short with me because i was having a HORRIBLE hearing day (sinuses SUCK) i finally got pissed off when she said why don't you turn those up i replied because my sinuses are absolutely clogged and it wont change a thing however your poor attitude can be changed. 

  
Another associate was yapping away about company changes, was annoying a whole group of coworkers and suddenly got mad with me because i was ignoring her she said why aren't you paying attention i thought those were to help you hear to which i replied ""you know i paid $4000 to be able to hear you i also paid $4000 to be able to not hear you so say something worth my batteries or be quiet "" 

  
my all time fave wasn't actually me standing up and im sharing this cause well i can .... 

went to subways and couldn't hear the server worth a damn because high school kids behind me were being loud and i had just gotten new hearing aids and was out for lunch with my then 5 year old daughter  
server \*mumble mumble\*   
me - pardon  
server \*mumble mumble\*  
teenage kid behind me sarcastically - hey idiot she asked you what kind of cheese  
my daughter - my daddys deaf and your rude ! 

  
3 1/2 foot tall daughter put a huge rugby player in his place in front of his friends and his girlfriend ! I learned that day ... speak up doesn't matter how bit you are stand tall don't let anyone walk all over ya  !   
  
now when people pull the rude deaf jokes i report it to HR i don't deal with BS and a manager rep once asked me why are you wasting your time reporting this ? i replied back bluntly if i do something racist im terminated, if i do something sexist im terminated but if i do something ableist or audist you think im wasting your time ? shall i go make fun of my managers walker ? how about the customers that use the power scooters ? you say respect for the individual .. well guess what i'm me and im proud of who i am and i have the right to be respected in my workplace ! Now if you still think im wasting your time let me know who your boss is and i'll talk to them about company policy !  Dont  let people make you feel less than them EVER !

I tell them to stop being so selfish.

Remember that HR is there to protect the company. But you can casually mention to HR that with attitudes like that, your colleagues are asking for the company to get sued. Don’t mention yourself, although that’s implicit. What if they did that in front of a client or visitor?

i have someo who works with me at school and i have a hearing aid and i was j telling someone to talk a little quieter and they said i was just saying that to be mean and i tried telling her that i wasn’t trying to be mean and she grabbed me by the arm and told me again to stop being mean",2025-03-06 23:53:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j59y7c/help_best_responses_to_people_being_rude_about/
1j4x6gg,hardofhearing,i need help (legally deaf/HoH),"i really dont know where to begin with this,
so im sorry if this is the wrong thread or if this post breaks mods rules/guidelines.

my name is seth. im 25 years old, i have bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and chronic tinnitus. 
im completely deaf in my left ear— i lost it overnight when i was 8 years old; (i wear a cochlear implant on my left side)
a year later when i was 9 i had swimmers ear in my right ear, and like clockwork, lost 75% of my hearing overnight. again. 

so fast forward to now, i’ve pretty much learned how to rehear, and how to use both devices to my advantage. im in the midwest area so cincinnati childrens was my savior, my dads insurance (at that time) paid for everything and escalated my situation. 

ive been trying to live life normally?
not that i can ever live life normally, 
but i truly ignored my disability and just brushed it off. i wish i went to some sort of support group, or therapy maybe? i dont want to sound negative or anything… i am confident in myself (in certain ways). i have passions and desires for myself like creating music, art, my own business, etc. 
i do love myself, however i feel like im doing something wrong? or im missing something? 

since my dad passed away on 10/26/2023, its been difficult to hold down a job. or to even find one.
i have great work ethic, and im a fast learner, 
but i dont think thats enough. 
i really wish i was in a trade or college. 


i guess i have a question, maybe a few:

1. am i disabled? i know i dont technically qualify for SSDI or anything because i was denied when i was 14 or so. my reason for asking isnt for financial help,
but to relieve that burdened thought ive never been able vocalize for myself. 

2. am i supposed to act like i have nothing wrong with me? 

3. do i need to accept it and face the fact that i am disabled and that i need help? 


i feel guilty. i feel ashamed. 
i always tell myself that i have things to be grateful for and things to be happy about, and that my life isn’t so bad. i could be in a worse situation. 
but i dont know if i can continue to treat myself like this anymore. i hate feeling lost, i hate feeling afraid. 


my main goal is to find a career or a job that i feel comfortable/appreciated in. my main ideas are trades, college, community college, career opportunities in full-time, so on. 
any advice is appreciated. 


EDIT: reading these replies do make me feel better and i appreciate everyone who has commented, makes me somewhat emotional. 
thank you everyone for being supportive

Find the vocational rehab department in your city. They are amazing at helping people like us. They'll buy any adaptive devices that'll help you keep a job. They'll help you find the right type of job and send you out on interviews! Trust me, start there!

Hey, don’t be so hard on yourself. At 25 people are still figuring life out.

1. Yes, hearing loss is technically a disability. 
2. You are not obligated to disclose your disability. Sometimes you will need to, like if you want to go scuba diving or something.
3. Acceptance of yourself will come with time. Ask for help as needed.

Also, you might like working in a factory as an assembler. I feel like this is something HoH people can excel at because a lot of things are written down in drawings or diagrams. 
If you want to do college, I suggest going online. It was so much easier as a HoH person for me vs in person.

Don’t worry too much… things will be okay.

You’re 25, the world is still open to you. You want to go to college or start a trade? Do it. 

In my normal day to day I forget about my hearing loss, granted mine is *only moderate loss and I wear HAs.

I'm applying for SSDI as well right now and it's soook hard. Start applying either way because if you are approved they'll have to pay you back from when you first applied. But also please join a trade My husband's an electrician and makes more than double what I make as a cook who has been in the field for 10 years. Independent electrical contractors of Wichita help pay for his schooling he got a job and his boss paid for 3/4 of his schooling until he became a journeyman. I would start with the non-union trade schools in your area and see if they have special relationships with trades in the area like mine did.

Hi, Seth! Thank you for putting yourself out here and letting me read your story. I'm sorry for your loss. My dad (M52) passed recently too back in December 2022. I was late diagnosed at 19 years old with hearing loss. I've been wearing hearing aids for a couple years on/off. 

You do not need to feel ashamed about your hearing loss. That's how I felt at first, too. It felt like I had been living a lie, sort of. But you don't need to worry. There is an entire Deaf community who stands behind you. 

To answer your questions: 

1. Defining a disability is very broad. However, it is my belief that being Deaf/HoH is a disability. This is because I struggle in day to day activities due to my hearing. When I worked in the retail industry, my coworkers would try to yell at me through the hall to get my attention. Their efforts were fruitless because I could not hear them and they were not talking directly at me. I suppose you could say that part of hearing is also seeing. I see people's lips move but I dont know if they're talking to me unless they're directly looking at me. Defining how you feel about being HoH is completely up to you. 

2. No. There is nothing wrong with you. Nobody is born perfect and you shouldn't have to feel like you need to hide your hearing loss to the world. Being Deaf is actually great. When I started wearing hearing aids, my head would hurt so much because of the loud noises. Granted, I live in a city and commute to college which is situated near train tracks and an airport. So I hear lots of planes, trains, and automobiles going around. That annoys the hell out of me. I can take my hearing aids out whenever I want and not have the strain of the noise pollution around me. It will take time for you to accept yourself and its very hard. But I know you can do it. 

3. Depending on how you feel about question #1, yes and no. Only you can decide for yourself what you truly want to do. It does not matter what others people think. There is a community here for you to help and support you. 

I know things are really confusing and tough right now. But I think you're doing great. You're doing as best thay you can and know how, and that's amazing for you. 

As for career options, I think you would benefit greatly from attending community college and then transferring to a university if you're interested. Community college is ultimately cheaper than university, and you just spend the first couple years doing pre-reqs anyways. It's to help you figure out who you are and what your passions truly are

I am a college student right now with a special interest in Deaf culture and ASL. I think you would benefit greatly from taking a Deaf culture class. It was really eye opening. I cried once during it because I had never felt so seen and understood. My professor for that class is Deaf, she communicates through signing and we had interpreters. I have also been taking ASL classes. Through attending, I have met many more Deaf people. 

I wish you luck on your journey and the best for you.

Do what you want to do. I became an RN and later a nurse practitioner. But, let me address the undertones. You miss your father, and it sounds like he was a fabulous support to you. I would nt have gone to college, and done all I did without the encouragement and support of my husband. You need some people in your corner who believe in you. It is my opinion that settling for disability will worsen your mental health. It is normal human development for someone your age to be productive, leave their mark in the world, use their talents to help others and better life for yourself.

“Am I disabled?” I think that answer, in relation to collecting disability, varies depending on where you live and degree of deafness. You’re 25 so you’re still able to get into a trade if you want. I suggest you google how to get into your desired trade where you live

Definitely search VOC Rehab in you area.

""State VR programs provide VR services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice, so that they may prepare for and engage in competitive integrated employment or supported employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency.

I was about your age when my father died suddenly. It rocked me. It took me quite a while to process it.  I kept telling myself it shouldn't have been a big deal because I was an adult. I've since seen research saying people really need their parents for love and advice until they are 40. So it's a significant loss to lose a parent at your age. Nobody who is 25 should feel like a failure. Being in your 20s is all about figuring out what direction to go. It's about being unsettled and unsure. It's like a developmental stage. As far as the disability, well yes, not having a hugely important sense is a disability. It's an incredibly isolating disability. If you were blind, you wouldn't be asking the question. If your question is whether you can get disability payments, I have no idea.",2025-03-06 14:52:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j4x6gg/i_need_help_legally_deafhoh/

I have access to captions, emails, etc and I am grateful for it. However, as time goes on I find that I feel I have to prove myself even more and working in this current political climate has also been a challenge. It has also become mentally draining reading caption after caption on video calls constantly keeping up with everything that needs to be said or sometimes even after asking what I think is all the questions there may be one or two things I have misunderstood on what to do. I’ve been looking into other roles outside of being online. I don’t know how much longer I can last in corporate. Is anyone else experiencing anything like this? How are you managing? 

[댓글]
I understand, I had to be better than everyone else to get opportunities. But, dang, I WAS better than everyone else! I had a career as a nurse and nurse practitioner until Long COVID wiped me out. I’m retired now. It is exhausting trying to keep up with everything and people don’t understand.

Having had just one retail position as an ice cream scooper/cashier as a teen, it was enough to cause me to sleepwalk lol. COVID also wiped me out in many ways, converting to online school sucked because it was hard to understand when your professor has a strong accent... Since then, I only focused on jobs where hearing and constantly communicating isn't a factor, it'll have to be physical jobs though... Like a housekeeper, until that burned me out bc every employer WILL try to min-max everything including your labor and equipment. Now I am just working towards outdoor jobs. Gardening, horticulture assistant, etc. There might be jobs that include office work after I am done with school, which is fine, because those spaces are quiet and it's easier to hear people, but this is only because I have a curiosity about nature and choose to pursue an education in it. I don't know how comfortable you are in your hearing levels, but communicating in person might be easier than straining yourself mentally everyday over the computer. Getting a diploma or certificate to start would be a good start to a new career,

Personally I love being a WFH corporate type.

I would recommend seeing if you can get access to a transcription app in addition to the built in captions on your video call app.

I use an app called Grain.com, Otter.ai is another one that's widely used. They both work seamlessly with Zoom, Google Meet, and Teams (probably others but I haven't had to try.)

Having a transcript after the call is life changing. The captions are good for what they are but it's still possible to miss something.

I really like the transcription option as that gives you more than a line or two so you don’t need to read as speedily. It is exhausting though.  

For projects you may want to ask for written instructions or write down what you understood and confirm it is correct.  At minimum ask for a recap of action items at the end of the meeting.

I worked as an Insurance Adjuster and Claims Examiner prior to current role as a Disability Case Manager. Both are very corporate and both are very communication intense. Even though, I have phone calls and virtual meetings, I ask for everything in writing post-meeting/call as well if there are action items or I will send out my version of the summary to the client. For those virtual meeting - closed caption is a must and occasional post-meeting transcription read through as well if available. I admit it is very mentally draining on days where I have more calls and meetings with both external clients and internal staff. Luckily the employer that I work for is very inclusive and have been willing to spend quite a bit of money to make sure the computer/headsets work w/ my hearing aids and also if needed to bring a junior staff with me to be my ears or note taker in meetings/calls. But yea, that drive and need to be better is quite demanding.

Can you hear conversations at all or are your devices only for notifying you of sounds?  

If you can have verbal conversations, you might want to look into SonicCloud. It like a hearing aid or cochlear implant is added to your computer.  It’s one of the only ways I can still do my job as a project manager.",2025-03-06 10:26:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j4sj2u/wfh_as_a_hard_of_hearing_employee/
1j4hr75,hardofhearing,Advice for Elderly hearing Impaired caregiver,"Hi -

Hoping someone can help me. I'm desperate. My mother-in-law is hard of hearing. She's caring for her elderly husband. He is on a couple different machines that make an alarm sound(s) when there is a problem. She cannot hear any of those sounds.

  
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to configure something or advise on a product that would either significantly increase the sound of those alarms or relay that alert to something else so she will be alerted when something gets triggered. Also open to any other ideas to help with this situation.

  
I'm terrified of her not hearing a critical alarm. THANK YOU!!!

Im severely hard of hearing in one year and moderately hard of hearing in the other. My daughter came home from the NICU on oxygen and a pulse ox. I had hard time hearing it when it went off at night. I talked to the home health team and they were able to set us up with this new equipment that also came with a watch. When the pulse ox alarm went off the watch would light up and vibrate. It would also give me her oxygen levels and heart rate to which made it easier for me.

I wonder if there is a flash receiver that can be programed to flash and/or vibrate (the bed if she's asleep) when the alarms go off. Did you contact the social worker at his hospital for resources? Or your states commission for elderly or the Deaf and HOH?

Contact your local CHA(Canadian Hearing Association) for ideas, such as sound activated light alarms, etc.

Take a look at [diglo.com](http://diglo.com) for a variety of alerting devices.

Your MIL can use a ClearCast PAL - an amplifying wearable hearing device so she will hear those critical sounds.",2025-03-05 23:41:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j4hr75/advice_for_elderly_hearing_impaired_caregiver/

The first thing I would do in your position is talk to your audiologist. They should be able to adjust the fit of your hearing aids so they stay in place, or fit more snugly.

Yes, wherever you purchased the hearing aids should be able to help. There are multiple pieces they can swap out for a better fit.

My previous pair seemed to pop out and flop around no matter what. My newer ones have been fit better and I’m MUCH happier. It’s a combo of the right dome and a “tail” that curls around just outside my ear canal - that has been cut and fit properly. I have glasses as well, so the fact that they sit well is a miracle.

I have moderate cookie bite hearing loss, which is likely to degenerate over time.  I'm young - 31 - and I've been eligible for hearing aids since I was 27 and first got tested.  I've likely had substantial hearing loss much longer.  I'm getting hearing aids this spring, hopefully.

I get very paranoid about making sure that I'm hearing pitch correctly and it definitely gives me performance anxiety.  I also get sad about the prospect of eventually not being able to do what I love.

Any advice?  Any other musicians out there with hearing loss? ",2025-03-04 06:48:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j34wge/semiprofessional_singer_with_moderate_genetic/

1j20hy4,hardofhearing,Tympanoplasty / Uvala Necrosis,"Just wanted to share my experience as it was very unexpected after researching I had found maybe 10 online posts from people, not doctors. Apparently my experience was somewhat unique? 

I’m a high school senior, and about five years ago, I got tested for hearing loss. That’s when the doctors found scar tissue on my eardrum and diagnosed me with mild to moderate conductive hearing loss. Since I have plans to join the military within the coming months I decided to go through with surgery, since my hearing was the only thing that could disqualify me.

The first week after surgery was absolute hell. At first, I felt fine—my doctor gave me a patch to help with nausea—but after the hour-long car ride home, which I add the nausea set in during, I was too weak to even walk. For the next two or three days, every time I tried to stand, I’d get so nauseous I had to stop and wait a minute. Then, I found out I couldn’t talk either. My doctor told me I probably have sleep apnea, and because of the breathing tube they used during surgery, I ended up with uvula necrosis.

On top of all that, I couldn’t focus my eyes on anything close to my face for the entire first week. I missed school, I missed work, and I felt awful. Honestly, I had regretted getting the surgery.

Now, a week and a half later, I feel way better. I started back to my normal routine, except for lifting heavy stuff. My uvula still isn’t fully healed, but it’s shrunk enough that I can talk again. I’ve been keeping up with my eardrops and using cotton in my ear to catch drainage and stop wax from building up.

The first week was hell, but at this point, I think it’ll be worth it—especially if it means I’ll be able to enlist without any issues.

Notes:

Multiple times I would google ""Tympanoplasty (insert symptoms)"" and would stress as the google ai would tell me my surgery got messed up call my doctor.

After the uvula necrosis became apparent honestly my best recommendation is just get used to it being there as no matter what you do it will constantly be rubbing against your throat and tongue. However with a narrow air way I have experienced trouble breathing as I tend to take large breaths every few minutes to compensate. 



-- Mar 7th, 2025

As I near the third week of recovery, I had my packing replaced, and for the first time, I could hear better than ever. It was an incredible feeling at first, almost like experiencing sound in a whole new way. However, on the way home, things started to take a turn. At first, it was just a mild irritation, but it quickly escalated into a pounding headache. Eventually, the discomfort became so intense that I had to hold my ear, trying to ease the pain. I’m not sure if the irritation was caused by the repacking itself, which may have aggravated my eardrum as it adjusted to movement and sound, or if my ear has simply become way more sensitive to noise than before. Either way, it went from exciting to unbearable pretty fast.

I can't understand people, but a kid squealing next to me in the supermarket makes me feel like I need to leave my body. Truck breaks squeaking make me hate my life. Hard-shutting doors make me jump out my skin. 

I used to think I had auditory processing disorder. It was really hard to ask the doctor if I should get my hearing tested, and she was super skeptical of it at first. Glad I did. There's so much that I just blamed on other people or bad audio, or chalked up to auditory processing issues and inattention (I still have inattention, but apparently being hearing impaired makes it worse).

They don't tell you in like, health class or whatever, when you're growing up, that hearing impairment isn't an all or nothing thing. I didn't think I could have hearing loss if certain things were still not just loud, but feeling louder and more annoying.

1j0i5gb,hardofhearing,Considering getting a tympanoplasty,"Hey so I have a perforated eardrum due to multiple tubes as a child, so I’m considering getting the tympanoplasty done. I wanted to hear from your experiences if you’ve had it before I make an appointment with the otologist.

I know the recovery before you go to work is about 1-2 weeks to go back to work, but how long before your hearing is back to normal? I go to concerts fairly often and would want to schedule this so it won’t interfere with any events I have planned. 

The perforation doesn’t cause a lot of hearing loss but I do get a fair amount of pulsatile tinnitus. Sometimes certain frequencies cause my ear to get irritated. Would a tympanoplasty solve this?

Finally, how common is it that my previous problems that I needed tubes for would come back? I had 5 tube surgeries done and I wish I could remember why but I was a kid. I’ve asked my parents why but they can’t remember. If I patch this hole, how likely is it that they would later need to reopen it to drain any fluid?

1j09nza,hardofhearing,Mental Health being HOH,"Hey guys, I've been struggling with my mental health recently. I have hearing loss and recently got sick with an ear infection. I have been to my doctors who says the fluid build up is gone and everything. I can't see an ENT for months and my doctor needs to refer me. I think going to my Audiologist might be a good idea.

Anyway, I've been scared I lost more of my hearing. I've read that Antibiotics and Antidepression/Anxiety meds are ototoxic. I finished the Antibiotics (took two weeks and stronger ones the second week) and I do take Sertraline. Is this something I should be concerned about? I'm so scared and struggling right now. 

I have been going for a walk in the mornings which helps a bit and counting backwards to get my mind away from the thinking. Is there anyone else who struggles like this? 

[댓글]
I’m not sure of any correlation with mental health meds and hearing loss. I attribute my hearing loss to loud concerts and no hearing protection as well as terrible ear infections in my youth. The bones in my ears don’t conduct sound like they should. Do get to an audiologist because they can help understand the root cause of the hearing loss and severity.

You are doing a great job! 🫂🫶

I don't know how helpful my answer will be (I hope it is) but this question feels like it was made for me. I have an EVA in my right ear that caused profound hearing loss in that ear - this was diagnosed as a young child and I've adapted, but sometimes I still get upset/sad about having to navigate a world that wasn't built for me (and I know I don't have it that bad compared to people with full hearing loss). 

Then, fall 2023, which was the start of my senior year of college, the hearing in my left ear became muffled and by October, I could barely hear my professors when I was a few feet away from them and I had to listen to videos out loud on full volume. And because it's impossible to see a specialist in the US without jumping through hoops, I had an appointment with a GP in September, and then a visit to an audiologist in mid-November. In the meantime, I tried as many solutions as I could find online, mostly for fluid build up because I suspected that was the issue. They were all temporary, though, so any relief I felt was short lived and disheartened me further. The day after the audiologist appointment, where they did the same hearing exam I did annually as a child, I was told it was most likely fluid build up (I could've told them that) and had an appointment the next day thankfully with an ENT, where he poked my eardrum and drained the fluid (there's a medical name for this but idk) and placed a tube, which I had removed a few months later. Even though this was a medical procedure, not my at home solutions, I definitely lived in fear for a while that my hearing would become muffled again (it has not). 

  
To address the other part of your question, I was diagnosed with depression at 17 (I'm 23) and have been taking antidepressants ever since. Currently on prozac and wellbutrin but I've been on many over the years. I can't speak about the antibiotics as much (though I've taken them a couple times for various illnesses). I can pretty definitely say that ssris and many other types of antidepressants do not affect your hearing loss or any issues arising from an ear infection/other ear-related issues. I know I talked a lot about my muffled hearing experience, but that almost definitely arose from mold or bacteria in the air conditioner in the room of the house I lived in summer 2023. 

  
Aside from my depression issues, I completely get the fear about losing more of your hearing when you already have hearing loss. Consult as many resources as possible before making any conclusions, and it may be helpful to find someone to talk to about the ways you're struggling. Hope this is helpful in any way!

My AD is supposed to be ototoxic, and a lot of people report ear ringing on it. However, it's probably other things, unless you just went on it and didn't have an ear infection recently and then lot some hearing or heard more ringing.

I was worried, because I had moderate tinnitus to begin with, which had recently gotten worse about a couple months before. Right around the time I think I lost some hearing, way before I got my first adult hearing test. It never got worse. Doesn't seem like it made my hearing worse, either. I've just had my hearing issues since I was around 20 years old.

[deleted]

I take several drugs that are ototoxic. One is for epilepsy, one is for multiple sclerosis and two are for my sanity (mood,) including sertraline. If I didn't take them I'd likely be dead.  It's a life or death choice. But SNHL runs in the family and I j got the worst of it. I also had the most serious earaches as a child, including a hole in my eardrum. Out of five siblings, three of us wear hearing aids. I however unlike the others have a hearing dog because I hear nothing without hearing aids.

First off, only a fraction of people will experience Ototoxcitiy through Antibiotics. As was recently found out, an ototoxic reaction to Antibiotics requires a genetic predisposition, which is why Antiobioticy cause hearing loss only in a single digit percentage of all patients.

Further, only a single group of Antiobiotics can cause hearing loss: Aminoglycosides, recognizable by havign their names and on ""-cin""

That said, hearing loss only appears when these antiobiotics are given intravenously in massive doses, which usually only happens in the ICU with patients who have their life directly threatened by severe bacterial diseases. Further, these antiobiotics are not available as pills at all, as they cannot be absorbed by the intestines and human mucosal membranes in general. In short, unless you get injected with huge doses of specific antibiotics, you have nothing to fear from that angle.

I totally understand you. If it was me I would do what's in my hands to control my anxiety about this. Like, buying ear infection drops, or making an effective diy to control the bacteria like a few drops of hydrogen peroxide. I know is not the most smart advice, but in my hearing loss journey the only thing that has helped me is to try to have a more stoic, resilient mindset. Yes, there are days were I can be very sad about my loss because is severe but others I just try to focus on the things that can make me smile, like short goals, practicing my favorite hobbies, doing self care. And also having a delulu positivity in which I think, there will be a day in the future that all hearing loss can be recovered by science advancements, and I will be there to be healed, also sometimes I think personally that God does miracles, and no one knows if in the future, by faith and praying we can be chosen to see his mercy and power on us. Don't lose hope please and redirect your attention to the positive.

A hobby really helped me getting through being deaf while waiting to get a cochlear implant. I would talk to doctors and look at hearing aids. I got through eight amazing years with hearing aids before getting a CI.",2025-02-28 15:02:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1j09nza/mental_health_being_hoh/

1iyb497,hardofhearing,Please some advice... Dr. Doesnt recommend surgery.,"So, I have been having on and off ear infection for the last 2 years. Typically once a year. This year was the worst where my eardrum got perforated.  The perforated eardrum healed completely fully like 2-3  In the span of 3 months. But perforated because of a cold and repeated infection 

According to the doctor the hole is roughly 10% or less.

Fast forward to now I had some bad advice from my ENT doctor who recommended that I use 70% Rubbing alcohol three times a day in my ear. It gave me bad tinnitus and I felt like my hole got bigger. I have since stopped.

Now it doesn't appear like the hole is healing anymore. Everyday I have tinnitus, ear fullness/pressure, and it can feel pretty tender. I feel like surgery would help improve my symptoms. 

Originally my doctor kept recommending tympanoplasty but I wanted to see if it would heal first. Which it didn't but now he's suddenly stating that he does not recommend the surgery anymore...

Is there any reason why the doctor would suddenly push towards that decision?

Go to a more skilled and knowledgeable ENT. Never should you put anything into an ear with a hole. I have a tube and have to visit the ENT for cleanings.  The only thing that goes into that ear are drops for infection.

A doctor who doesn't want to do surgery should be listened to.  Either he doesn't want to do surgery because the benefit isn't greater than the risk.  There are always risks with surgery.  Or the doctor lacks the surgical skill.  You need a second opinion.  Someone who can explain what to do.  Also, a good explanation of why or why you should not have surgery.

This is not really the best sub for this kind of question, this is more along the lines of medical advice

Get a second opinion. Look for an ENt that has other specialities. 

Some examples are ENT’s who on their website list credentials like:

Neurology, Otology with a known fellowship program, skull based surgery (with fellowship), Neurosurgery, etc. 

For example; my ENT is a Neurosurgeon too!

A regular ENT may honestly and sadly be a glorified primary care guy. Take your time. Look for a good one and stop asking for advice from internet randoms!",2025-02-26 00:57:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1iyb497/please_some_advice_dr_doesnt_recommend_surgery/

From my understanding as a non professional it depends on the type of hearing loss a person has. My audiologist said there was no surgery that could fix my hearing and I will always have it but hearing aids could help

If you are born with a hearing loss. Then no. 

But if it's something over time due to age or exposure or sickness.. then maybe. Depending on what and if it's even possible.

Depends on what you define as ""near future"". Theres a whole range of promising projects for treatments and even cures for hearing loss, but until something is actually available to patients in the clinic? Best case is something like 5-10 years, but I wouldn't bet on that. These things take time.

You could also ask if they do their own genetic testing ENT doctors to see if there is anything since you also got family members who lost at least one side

There is lots of research being done in trying to regenerate the hearing cells like Rinri Therapeutics.(Trials start this year) While this does give hope it's still to early to tell. At the moment there are hearing aids or cochlear implants depending on how much loss you have. I'd definitely talk to you Audiologist, ENT or doctor about options. Tech is a wonderful thing!

I'm in a room with a door closed, talking with my resident, doing her care. I finish my care with resident A. Go get resident B off the toilet and she informs me that LPN was just in here and said that someone will be with you in a minute. Wait what so LPN came into your bathroom turned off the callbell but couldn't help you? Resident B shrugged. I said i see.
I did 8 cares by myself,  plus the books, plus went on my break which I am entitled.
Well LPN came and said I feel like alot of people missed breakfast today, like 5. I said yes they did. Then ask me what I could have done differently? ...what could you as my ""superior"" do to ensure adequate staffing is on each floor. I wish I was quick enough to say that.
However I said the other girl was late then she has the nerve to say it was only 1.5 hrs late.  
Cause I was going to say it takes 25 min per care, well that 1.5 hours of 3 care so only 2 would have missed breakfast then it wouldn't be an issue.

Do you want to elevate it to your management? ADA issues

I'm so sorry that happened to you.  Healthcare can be tough even for those who can hear, but beyond difficult for those who can't. Continue to stand up for yourself.  It sounds like you did a great job taking care of the patients while being short staffed.  You are 1 person and can only do what you can do.  The LPN should have gotten the patient off the toilet herself and helped feed, etc.

If you feel things fall in the discrimination category, don't be afraid to report it to the proper people.

I am sorry this is happening to you. The safety issue is the staffing level. Is there a policy which states the number of staff that have to be present for patient load?

My guess is there is no union.. Does the company have an HR person, anyone that you can speak with? Who supports stuff and does not always take management side 

 I would suggest you write everything down that happened what was said when andnby whom, what you did that day in detail,  just write it all down whether or not it gets used and whether or not it ends up being relevant. But I would just write it down in detail. While your memory is fresh. 

 I admire anyone who works in personal health care. It's brutal and you don't get the appreciation you deserve. As someone who has had to rely on health care personnel many times in my life through many hospitalizations, there are many of us who do appreciate you very much. 

 Is there a handbook or manual that employees get? Regular reviews?

Those are the kinds of things I would just arm yourself with so that if it escalates in any way you know your position and what your rights are and how they're covered. Or not.

it's a reasonable fear, it does happen.

And people wonder why we get paranoid about comments we don't hear.....

My wife has suggested that I wear a t-shirt with the words ""HARD OF HEARING"" displayed prominently.

I am not interested.  It seems like I would be wearing a sign that announces that I am ""Defective""

Yep. For me, it’s because people start yelling at me or talking to me like I’m stupid (dumbing down what they said to absurd levels when I ask them to repeat themselves). It happens regardless of how smoothly the conversation had been to that point. I avoid telling people until they notice my hearing aids. Of course then they start yelling at the top of their lungs about how they didn’t notice. 

I do have a coworker who will talk crap about me sometimes in front of me because she thinks I can’t hear her. Especially if it’s crap about how I said I didn’t hear what she said. I think she doesn’t believe me for some reason. Or she’s one of those people who think hearing aids make your hearing 100% perfect

I’ve never felt this way, and I’m sorry to hear people have been so rotten to you. I’ve found that when I tell someone who’s been getting impatient with me, they look a little embarrassed for being so. Admittedly, my hearing loss is conductive and fluctuates- so sometimes, I can hear perfectly fine. Maybe that keeps them on their toes…

yes! I just tell them I have sensory disorder if they're asking me questions that lead to that topic.

It's weird how confused people act about it on the phone. Just speak near the damn mic.

But it would also act as a great filter in finding mature, intelligent people... and healthy workplaces as well. It's unfortunate the way people suddenly act differently towards you, its really bizarre. I've had excellent experiences before where my disability is a non-factor, however, in places with cliques, it'll suck because people are insecure as hell and don't want to feel like 'some deaf person' is better than them... **Your ability to stand up for yourself is the number one BEST tool**. People are aware of social manners, in most cases, the bullying is passive and not full-on criminal behavior like assault. Use it to your advantage and politely ask them to stop talking to you like that. Make it difficult for people to feel comfortable in socially abusing you ie., ""Do not sneak up on me like again, please"", make daily logs of incidences and use HR resources strategically, only address offensive behavior made directly to you, don't add them on social media (As a matter of fact, BLOCK THEM) etc, and most certainly, ignore passing comments you did not completely hear they just want your reaction and you cannot be certain what was said. I don't know what environment (Highschool? :/ ) you're in, so you are the only one who can make the right judgement. If you don't have a reliable friend there, you probably should just leave when you can tbh...

I typically disclose my hearing loss (severe to profound). The reality is, staff would have to make some accommodations for me to work. I’m certain it has cost me jobs, but I think of it this way… I don’t want to work for someone who chooses not to see my value over my disability. I’m currently in a small nonprofit, so we don’t have HR to report to with complaints. The current staff is super to make sure they face me, speak clearly without yelling, etc. They do however whisper in front of me at times. It’s definitely frustrating, but I try to remember that they don’t understand our culture if we don’t educate them. We also have some technology that combined with my own resources helps with success. We use an app for calls that allows me to use captioning. I am in the market for a new job, due to some other stressors and lack of upward mobility and benefits. I know the already small job pool is even smaller for me. 

Some people are always going to be jerks. I try to avoid them, and I certainly don’t want to work with them. I do realize that sometimes it’s not a choice and you have to take what’s available to you.

1iw1edj,hardofhearing,Ear muffled for hours after working out?,"Hey all! I am dealing with a sudden partial hearing loss.

Today I was working out in my living room with some light dumbbells (10 pounds, nothing crazy). But during a particularly strenuous set of lunges I felt my right ear just muffle. Felt like someone stuffed cotton into it and lost part of my hearing. 

I tried ALL the things to clear it again. Holding my nose and breathing out gently. Holding my nose and breathing out harder. Holding my nose and swallowing. 

All those things just stuffed up my other ear or made that one worse. I even used Afrin to try and clear my sinuses, which has just given me an all day runny nose. 

Is there anybody here who ever experienced this? I saw some other accounts of it online, but most people said they felt theirs pop and clear up within 30 minutes to 3 hours. 

This has been going on for me for 8 hours and it hasn’t really cleared. I’m becoming used to it, but still have a “cottony” feeling deep in there. I don’t know if this could be permanent. 

I received a blood patch a week after my baby was born 8 months ago because I was wet tapped with my epidural which resulted in a spinal fluid leak. (Low intracranial pressure). The blood patch fixed my leak and the awful headache I had. 

I mention this in case it could possibly play a role, somehow.

Just thought I’d ask for any similar experiences/advice in this sub!

Any sudden and unexpected hearing loss warrants a trip to a doctor. There’s nothing Reddit will be able to do for you.

Urgent care should check to see if there's a wax clog or fluid behind your ear. If neither, you need to see an ENT as soon as possible - sudden hearing loss responds much better to treatment the sooner you get treated.

1ivqz6u,hardofhearing,best over the ear headphones to wear with hearing aids?,"hellooo \~ i currently use Phillips 9050 hearing aids and i have custom earmolds with them. i’m looking into getting over-the-ear headphones for things like the gym or just while i’m at school studying. i have airpods and i love them a lot and i use the frequently at home or when i just want to tune everything and everyone out, but it’s difficult having to take my hearing aids out and put the earbuds in and then take those out and put my hearing aids in when i’m done.  
i’ve just started going to the gym again and it was just difficult having to have my airpods in and not being aware. even in transparency mode, and with my music paused, i can’t hear anyone and i did let the girl at the front desk know to just wave me down if she needs me, i’d rather just have an easy fix.  
my hearing aids do have bluetooth streaming but for some reason, when i listen to spotify the quality is not good. watching videos is fine and so are phone calls or even listening to songs on like instagram! but spotify is just not it   
i’ve looked at the jlab headphones ([JLab JBuds Lux ANC Over Ear Headphones Graphite](https://www.jlab.com/products/jbuds-lux-anc-headphones-graphite)) and i had seen some tiktoks of hearing aids users saying they were good but i don’t know. i can’t afford anything too expensive. i like bass and i had looked into these skullcandy ones ([https://www.skullcandy.com/products/crusher-evo-sensory-bass-headphones-with-personal-sound?variant=44215710416953](https://www.skullcandy.com/products/crusher-evo-sensory-bass-headphones-with-personal-sound?variant=44215710416953)) but $200 is a lot! the jlab ones are looking awfully good for my budget right now! but wanted to see with other, more experienced people.  
any suggestions??  
thank uuuu &lt;3

Specifically for the gym, I don't think there are any over-ear options that are going to be comfortable/won't fall off in under five minutes. I had the Philips 9040s for a couple of months at one point, and my Sony WH1000XM3 worked really well with them due to the elongated oval shape of the muffs. The XM3 is outdated now and the XM5 is still a bit pricey, however, you can find the WH1000XM4 on eBay for roughly 100 bucks or less depending on its condition. The build quality and noise cancelation are great too, I've had my XM3 for 5+ years and they still hold up well. The bass on them is incredibly strong, and their app has a great EQ manager if it happens to be overkill.

I have the samsung live buds 2020. They are not over the ear, but they do work with my HA because of how they are made.

I do not use HA while using my SONY WH10003.

I personally prefer to just use AirPods in the gym, but I’ve previously had good luck with something like this:

Depending on your hearing loss they may or may not work for you. You also have to take care given the way the work they can still damage your hearing if they are cranked up.

I'm a relatively new (daily) HA wearer and wondered this same thing just a few months ago. I'm using the Airpods Max now, which have worked great and never gave me any feedback or screeching sounds. Before this though, I was using the Bose QuietComfort and they were also great with my HAs. The Bose ones go on sale quite often. I bought mine for about $130 if I recall correctly. These aren't really unique recommendations, but I hope that helps!!",2025-02-22 19:33:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ivqz6u/best_over_the_ear_headphones_to_wear_with_hearing/

1iu4m1e,hardofhearing,Husband refuses to learn ASL,"He actually refuses to truly acknowledge that being HoH is a lifelong thing and that hearing aids and a cochlear don’t make you hearing. He always comparing hearing loss to poor eyesight and needing glasses (maybe it is??)

My daughter is 2. She was born HoH (bilat sensorineural hearing loss).  She has had a HA since 4 mo old and cochlear since Oct 2023. So she has always known hearing devices.  She responds well to sound, and knows a few words in ASL, no spoken words as of now. 

For those born HoH whose families didn’t learn ASL, how has your experience been? I have every intention of introducing my daughter to the Deaf community but not having my husband on board is infuriating and gives me a lot of anxiety.  Maybe it shouldn’t? I don’t know..

Thanks for your insight ♥️ I appreciate this community 

[댓글]
My parents never learned ASL but my hearing loss level didn’t really require ASL — bad enough for HAs, but not so bad that I can’t socially interact (though I am limited in that regard). 

The glasses comparison is understandable, but kinda falls apart in your specific situation given that your daughter has cochlear implants, which are for pretty profound hearing loss. This would be like saying someone declared legally blind is set as long as they have their rx glasses on.

Benefit of the doubt: he is in denial and just doesn’t know how to express it. When a previous partner needed medical help I kept saying “nah, you just need to learn to relax and take your mind off things”. I needed time to accept she needed mental health support and I was too in denial - thankfully I acknowledged my issues and accepted things and she got better. And while that was a long time ago and we are no longer together (for other reasons), we are still friends and she is doing well. 

Worst case: your partner is an assh*le and your kid deserves better.

My dad was like your husband. As an adult I barely speak to any of my family. 

I lip read, speak, use ASL but the othering that my own family did to me did enormous trauma and I have no interest in bending over backwards for people who couldn’t meet me halfway on communication. 

Tell him to get over himself. 

You also may want to look up TJ and Kylee on social media. that’s the adventures of a dad and his deaf daughter who gets a cochlear. Also keep in mind that when she got a cochlear she became 100% deaf in that ear, as did your daughter.  Kylee explains really well about the importance of being included by her family.

I like comparing being HoH to LOSING your eyesight, not just needing glasses. I’m also moderately nearsighted as well as severely hearing impaired, and glasses or contacts fixes my seeing problem almost perfectly. Hearing aids are imperfect and if I can’t hear someone, I can’t squint my ears or lean in closer to have things come into sound focus. 
Sounds are there and then they aren’t. Sounds can be quiet enough to miss entirely and never know they happened when you’re hard of hearing, but with light and vision, I can get a sense what is occurring and accomodate. I can adapt to my lack of sight, it is infinitely harder to adapt to a lack of hearing. 
Having blurry vision won’t lead to drastically increased chances of developing dementia, but untreated hearing loss will- and that is simply because our brains have to work so much harder to perceive the world we live in to make up for the loss that our brains burn out earlier- like an overworked heart.
Glasses are covered by insurance, they are (comparatively) cheap and available in drugstores or at retailers on street corners. Hearing aids or implants are usually several thousand dollars, not covered by the vast majority of insurance plans, and are very specialized: you cannot bring one brand of hearing aids to a specialist who sells another, they won’t be able to help you with them. They’re almost like cars, you can’t take a Jeep to a Ford dealership, many times the software can be locked, etc.
I could go on forever. The point is, hearing loss is an entirely different beast, it is not comparable to needing vision correction. I tell folks with glasses that it’s as if your vision starts going dark rather than JUST blurry at certain distances as a better comparison. It’s sometimes scary, overwhelming, rare in some communities (I don’t know anyone else my age with hearing aids- I’m 28- and there aren’t any organizations or local groups to meet them), and entirely not acceptable for families or loved ones to be able to make judgements or comparisons on our behalf, especially to dismiss what is considered a disability.
My fiancé works with kids with autism and didn’t know any ASL, even after years of being around the kids who communicate with it. When I started learning ASL, I was heartbroken to see my partner act indifferent about learning it himself. Without my hearing aids, it’s simply not feasible to communicate with anyone reliably. 
We had discussions, I expressed my feelings and talked about the things I mentioned above, and he came around to wanted to learn more. It’s still a struggle to get friends and family to understand, and they may never fully, but those of us who have hearing loss need to put our own wellbeing first, learn the things we need to cope, adapt, and thrive, and put what others think and say second. Just existing with the struggle isn’t fun and I feel myself breaking down with the added weight of worrying about how others perceive or dismiss it. Take care of yourself and your daughter, make sure you have the resources and support she needs (from you, from her teachers, organizations, doctors, etc.) and then take care of others. 
Sorry for the rant. Hearing loss has been my reality for 7 years now, I’ve researched, seen so many specialists and surgeons, had days I’ve broken down and days I’ve thrived, contacted support groups and distant friends-of-friends experiencing similar things, and I’m well aware of the way hearing loss is- ironically- a silent struggle with most.
Feel free to DM me to talk more!

Personally, I'd be divorcing him. It clearly will never get better. So if that's what you're holding on to, you might need to give it up. If he hasn't changed by now, what do you think will?  Your answer should reveal your decision. 

Best of luck.

Despite being HoH from the get-go, I was raised as a hearing child with no HA or anything, no Deaf culture, no ASL, nothing, and I really feel like it held me back socially and developmentally. I am stuck between two worlds and don’t fit into either, and I really regret that my parents didn’t accommodate me more or introduce me to Deaf culture.

I grew up knowing baby signs until I was 10 yrs old when I started to attend the deaf school. And stayed until age 17

I am hard of hearing with the same hearing loss as your kiddo but I am not CI. Just 2 regular hearing aids. 

My parents have said that just getting exposed to baby signs and having some deaf friends prior to the deaf was nice because they sawy quirks as normal within the hoh/deaf world and it gave them breather so when hearing people make snarky comments my parents can say. Well within her community it's actually normal/considered polite. 

Both of my parents are hearing and started to learn ASL when I did at 10. I told them to stop and stick with what they know which is baby signs. I needed a safe place to come home to. To breath after 8 hrs every day at school learning not only a new culture, world, and langague. 

Urvhsiband remindse of the movie Mr. Holland opus. (It's on Disney plus) And hearing mom and dad have a deaf boy and it's their journey to understand his world.  I highly recommend it. It's one where most deaf/hoh people really like it alot.

It's not like getting glasses and his ignorance pisses me off. I've forgiven my parents for being in denial and not really helping me because times were different. They didn't have the resources and were nervous when I was called the r word. I  shouldn't have had to decide if I needed to forgive my parents for the harm they caused by ignoring my hearing loss. 

With the resources you husband had there is no excuse. He is showing your child that they aren't worthy of basic communication. A lesson she is learning at age 2. Which he will continue to reinforce every year. I wonder what other things he is doing to show her she doesn't matter?

I don't see how he is a good dad if he refuses to do any work to communicate to his child.

My dad did the bare minimum and our relationship suffered for it (read: there isn’t one)

Languages have culture. It’s not just about communicating it’s a way of life a way of living. HoH people and Deaf people experience the world differently. I know you realize this and I’m glad you’re still going to pursue ASL for her sake. I’m HoH and no one on my family even acknowledged I couldn’t hear out of one ear. They just thought I was stupid or something I heard A LOT was “oh she’s has selective hearing”. 😒 I also wear glasses and have pretty bad eyes and I wouldn’t compare the two. With my hearing aides I can hear out of an ear I haven’t heard out of my entire life, my eyes still work without glasses it’s just not clear. I do feel like I missed out on a whole culture of people that are so wonderful. Yes I take part now but it’s different for those who grow up in it. I dunno how to explain it. Like I was raised as a “struggling hearie” because I was raised hearing when I couldn’t freaking hear. I cry for past me who didn’t have hearing aides and had people tell me rude things because I couldn’t hear them.

You 100% should seek out asl and the Deaf community. Your daughter deserves access to her native languages and ASL should be a native language she can access.

My child was 9 when we learned of the loss. 10 when we bought hearing aids for the first time. I started learning asl the month or so after we confirmed there was “mild” loss (all loss is a barrier and I hate the term “mild”).

Your husband isn’t your focus right now, she is. Do not stop advocating for her. That is your #1 job.

I am born totally deaf in one ear, 80% loss in the other but hears pretty good in certain ranges (think middle of the piano to the high pitch end on the right).

I was raised completely on the hearing culture - I was told that I initially did do about two years arond 6 years old but my parent was discouraged to find out the schools education focus to the deaf students was teaching them simply surviving life instead of core materials that would be typical for the same age. 

Throughout the years, I did mainstream, home schooling, online school, hybrid tutor/online and then mainstream using a mike/receiver communication kit.

I did college with ASL, transcriber and paying another student to help me with class notes (with permission from the professor and accomodations office).

I've found that hearing world focuses on social cues that are easily missed because of subtle word choices or implied understand that's difficult to elucidate without being blunt.

The deaf community is small enough to not be concerned about the bluntness and would actually prefer to be direct about opinions, expectations and emotional expression (since misunderstandings is a very preferred thing to avoid).

I've noticed that when I learned ASL, I've become more expressive with my face, body language and hands even with the hearing (you'd be sure how many signs are self explanatory). This would be very helpful in social situations.

Meanwhile, my hearing got worse over the years from gradual loss and recently introduction of tinnitus.

Frankly, every single possible methods should be explored - this keeps things safe from misunderstanding (which is a huge thing when it comes to the professional world. you don't just 'wing it.' and with what your husband is suggesting, that's basically what it is.), clarifies things well in order to avoid either parties being stressed or blanking out from panicking and frankly, language helps life be more vibrant. It develops the brain in creativity and seeing things in different ways.


There's so many ways to communicate and the more used, the preferred choice would be unique to her experience - use notes, use sign language, use transcribers, use the phone to help on voice to text, virtual transcription glasses, medical devices, hand gestures, even art. yes, even a sketch can do things.

Have him put on sound cancelling headphones and take him to a ballgame or church or a barbecue. Be by his side, be kind. But let him know that is what his child will experience if her batteries die or she looses a hearing aid. And she will need him to be by her side, be kind and to be her ears &amp; BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE with her. 
Sure, I get the vision comparison, sorta. But the emergency exit signs are red and lit for a reason - so vision impaired people can still recognize them without glasses! There’s fire, tornado, atomic bomb alarms, all audible. If she’s without aids, she needs her papa to be able to tell her what’s going on. The same way he’d hold her hand and guide her if she lost her glasses. Ultimately, he’s a good father and he’ll recognize that to teach &amp; protect that little girl ASL is needed. Then just wait til they have their own special little language that works across a room

I wasn't born HoH, but lost most of my hearing at an early age (17 months) so I don't know what it is like to have normal hearing. However, I've always been able to communicate well without HAs in childhood, and gradually lost more hearing in adulthood so now I have a HA and a CI. I don't know much ASL, so I am 100% oral/lip reading. I do wish I was at least conversational in ASL though.

That being said, it's a good idea to get in to see a counselor for the deaf/HoH for family counseling to reconcile this. It's a good thing for your daughter to have more language rather than less and I wonder what your husband's holdup is.

Glasses are not an adequate comparison at all. I wear glasses/contacts too so I can make the comparison. Lenses can correct vision to 20/20 or even better. But even the best HAs or CIs will not give perfect hearing. They tend to amplify ALL noises and make discrimination very difficult.

Im afraid maybe your husband doesnt like you or your daughter.

This might not be directly related to what you’re asking for.

I lost my hearing at 4. I have severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. 
I never needed ASL or have been interested in it. Also not interested in “being part of the deaf community”. Your daughter is a person and being hard of hearing does not define her completely. 

I think it’s fine to teach your daughter sign language, but the reality is she’ll have to live in a world full of non deaf or hard of hearing people, so I’d recommend you encourage her to participate in the world normally. Of course it’s going to be much more difficult for her than for other people, but I went to normal high schools, learned 3 languages (native Spanish, fluent in English and German by 18) and now at 30 I speak French as well. I went to university and did a masters as well. Your husband will just need extra patience when talking to her. 

Just my two cents. Technology and science are incredible these days, by the time she grows up I think there will be a lot of things that help her deal with her situation. For example there are some AR glasses that can write captions in real time for what people say. Look them up, they’re called even realities.

So this might be a weird comment, but have you heard of the movie The Sound of Metal? 

It’s an incredible award-winning movie about a drummer who loses his hearing. He refuses to acknowledge it until his girlfriend gets him to go to an ASL retreat. He refuses at first but then realizes his life is never going to be how it used to be so he joins. It’s very emotional how he deals with his new life but also uplifting and motivating when you see how he progresses with communicating with other Deaf people.

His goal is to eventually get a cochlear implant but it’s not what he thinks it will be.

I’d highly recommend watching this movie with your husband.

My son* is 2 and his father refuses to learn as well. 
My son is already showing signs of being bilingual (he has a lot of exposure to ASL through ASL instructor, Deaf community and deaf friends, as well as I sign with him). I begin ASL classes as soon as he was diagnoses. He deserves to have the choice of what he wants for himself when he’s older; to use ASL, HA or both. Introduce your daughter to the Deaf community, and start classes yourself. But, honestly it brought a lot of resentment into our relationship since my son has other medical needs as well. He doesn’t partake in any appointments for my son, doesn’t do the ASL classes. 

I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. Feel free to pm if you’d like.

* editing to add my son is HoH; severe bilateral SNHL and has mild cerebral palsy

ASL will give get a natural language and can actually help doormen language acquisition.  

Get your husband to do some reading from the more recent studies. The attitude of only spoken langue for deaf jigs is outdated and harmful.

I didn't lose my hearing until I was 23, but I now require HA. my mom was the only person in my family to learn ASL with me, and now that she has passed away, I find that communicating with the rest of my family is really difficult. Because I don't understand/hear what they are talking about, I get frustrated or just feel left out and unimportant and spend my time alone and alienated. By accident, I know, but that doesn't change the feeling.

Even if he doesn't learn, you can always start learning with her. I promise it will make a difference to your child. I know it did for me.

1ithcc6,hardofhearing,Has anyone been through this? Clogged ear,"Guys, I'm going crazy and need help, whether from a professional or someone who has been through this...

I'm 24 years old and usually sleep with earplugs. However, about two months ago, I woke up and, when removing the earplug from my left ear, I felt a strong pressure, as if a vacuum had formed. In the following days, the outer part of my ear became sore, and soon after, I caught a bad cold. Since I have rhinitis and sinusitis, the cold not only blocked my nose but also affected my ears.

The problem is that even after recovering from the cold, my left ear still felt clogged or muffled. Worried, I went to urgent care, where the doctor examined me and found that my ear canal was completely blocked with wax, recommending an ear irrigation. During the procedure, he used a syringe with warm water and assured me that I would feel immediate relief, though it might take some time for the sounds to balance out between both ears.

However, weeks passed, and the clogged-ear sensation persisted. I decided to see another ENT specialist, who used a camera to examine my ear and found it was completely inflamed, with a sort of bubble blocking the airflow in the ear canal. The doctor prescribed Cerumin and Otociriax ear drops, along with Busonid, Predsim, Loratadine, and nasal washes, all for seven days. I followed all the instructions, but the clogged-ear feeling still didn’t go away.

So, I decided to schedule an audiometry test. During the exam, I noticed a delay between the sounds, and since the test started with my right ear (the good one), I paid extra attention when they switched to the left. However, at times, I hesitated to raise my hand, even though I had the impression I heard something.

The audiometry results indicated ""normal tonal thresholds in the right ear and hearing loss at 6000Hz in the left ear."" The doctor said this hearing loss was mild and suggested waiting two months before getting an MRI to confirm whether there was actual hearing loss.

Still unsatisfied, I consulted a third ENT specialist, explained everything, and showed my test results. He recommended doing the MRI immediately to check for any issues in the auditory canals, along with allergy tests and a complete blood count. During the consultation, he also examined my nose and noticed that the left side looked ""odd,"" asking if I had recently had rhinitis flare-ups.

I got the MRI of my ears, but the exam showed no abnormalities on either side. Now, I'm waiting for the allergy and blood test results. What puzzles me is that even though I feel like I can hear perfectly from both ears, my left ear still has this clogged sensation, as if something is stuck inside.

Has anyone been through this or have any idea what it could be?

[댓글]
Alas, I think you have some hearing loss in that ear. The audiologist test showed it, and the ear still feels ‘full’ despite being cleared of wax. Hearing loss can sometimes feel like you have cotton/muffling in your ear.

I had this same clogged sensation since February after blasting music from my bluetooth earbuds. My exams didn't find hearing loss but I think I did, mostly in my left ear. Maybe I had hidden hearing loss.",2025-02-19 21:36:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ithcc6/has_anyone_been_through_this_clogged_ear/

[댓글]
Any of the glasses are only as good as the app that runs them. In my experience, that’s not very well. There are more situations it won’t work than it will.

I have no recommendations (they are all too expensive for me to have tried them out) but a quick google search says that there are at least 3 different brands. Xander, Hearview, and Xrai.

What makes your hearing aids to not be enough?  TBH, a smartphone with Google Live Transcribe or its Apple equivalent could do the job.

  
Also, I've always been HoH and changing aids requires me months of adaptation so...maybe it's your case?  The one I actually have, it took me 6 months to be to 75% capability, I feel like I'm at 90% after 2 years.  Another factor to take account of is brain rewiring and mental energy levels associated to these changes.

I've just started using Even Realities G1 glasses with AugmentOS. It is very early days for both - so please keep that in mind if you decide to try them out. That said, both companies have been super receptive to feedback and putting effort into their products. The glasses are well made and look nice, though the Even app wasn't very good at transcription. AugmentOS is better and allows you to switch to an external mic (phone or something connected to your phone, I think), but it eats your battery. AugmentOS says battery optimizations are coming soon.

It's not perfect captioning but for me it's promising and an investment in the technology. Even and AugmentOS have made their softwares open source so I'm hoping to see more apps start to pop up in the next year.",2025-02-19 12:52:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1it4rlo/captioning_glasses/

Hahaha so funny!! And it's not even jsut my coworkers it's my friends and their families that I'm incredibly close with, I've known them my whole life.

Or my favorite part, have you guys ever seen according to Greta, the scene where shes mouthing words to get the woman to turn up her hearing aid and then she starts yelling, its actually a common occurrence! Even if ur watching that scene thinking oh my god who would ever do that, thats literally horrible, multiple people have done that to me, multiple coworkers, friends, random people that just learned you are hoh! It's amazing. I kind of got of track there but just complaining! The only time they remember ur deaf is when they are actively using it againt you

For that one coworker who keeps saying she forgets your deaf, you can just say, oh I forgot your hearing.(But no laughing or emotions. Keep it flat)  Everytime she calls you out on it. Eventfully she will get tired of it and stop it. If not then it will be this quirky banter.

Not deaf, but severe hearing loss.  I have a button that tells people, and asks them to speak clearly.  It's a pretty large button, because when I wore a small one, people didn't notice it.

For the yelling one. I would ask why is she speaking louder .. it just makes her look not smart. You can't make a person who has a hearing loss hear if you keep louder and louder .. 

If she can't accept that then what you can do is not respond and just say hold on I need to turn off my hearing aids so you can talk otherwise I will get a headache of how loud you yell .

I just want to say me too. I’m moderate to severe HoH but wear hearing aids at work. 

So many times people tell me oh I forgot, or my favorite, you don’t act deaf. 

Like what does acting deaf look like to you. I have a device that helps me and I’m good at placing myself in situations that help me understand better. 

It’s not that I’m less deaf, it’s that I know how to advocate for myself and do the lifting of my disability to ensure I can operate in your world. Can’t you at least be considerate enough to see how hard that is",2025-02-18 23:20:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1isqfu8/people_forgetting_im_deaf/
1ispvc4,hardofhearing,Work,"I'm deaf in my left ear, but for work I have to wear a headset so I opt for it to be on my good ear but it's incredibly hard to hear anything that happens in the building. I really like my job but my coworkers are not accommodating at all and will never repeat themselves or get my attention when talking to me even though i have told them multiple times, ""they forget I'm hoh""

Sometimes I keep the headset off but it's so hard to do my job up to par without wearing one, hearing the orders come in. The best option for me is to keep it around my neck with the volume all the way up but sometimes i still cant hear the customers. Does anyone have any recommendations or have had this same problem, what did you do. I've asked the owner if they could connect the order speaker to the radio in the store because I know they can do that and we don't use the radio but they said no and didn't really give me a reason. AND I KNOW that last part is a lot to ask but we have like 15 workers total and I don't think it's a big ask when it will help a worker do their job better and feel more comfortable.

Usually if the people inside the store are not accommodating me I take off my headset and they can see how I work then. (Not good it's way slower not hearing the orders as they are being said)

Ugh and i know the right thing to do is get a job that doesn't require a headset

I'm so sorry your experiencing this. I'd love to point out all the joys of being deaf to flip the script AND as adult, born significantly hard of hearing/deaf, I get it. But please know you are normal and these are normal feelings. Some days are better than others, and as others have said you are not alone.

As someone with a similar “my kid isn’t disabled they’re just stupid” family (thanks [Christian Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science) /s) I hope you find your tribe

Do you have any Deaf people in your life? You sound just like many people I know who are isolated and marginalized in some way. Having a community of people who are more like you really can help for a lot of folks.

I don't hate being deaf. I don't miss those sounds. I like the peace of not being bothered by all that noise.

I do hate that it is a never-ending battle to get accommodations. The worst is when I am going to an appointment with my hearing wife and the doctor office refusing to provide an interpreter because the deaf person is not the patient. 

I do hate being left out of conversations. I wish more people signed so access was just always there and not anything special.

I do like what you wrote and how you wrote it. It reads like a poem filled with crushing emotion.

As others noted, having a deaf/hh friends that understand the experience can help make some bright moments.

Me too!

I haven't had a hearing aid in years.
Its difficult, everything you mentioned and also the tinnitus.

I feel you. Sometime I wish I was just born deaf and didn’t loose it gradually because I still remember what it was. The hardest part is social interactions for me, even with friends it started being a chore because I had to concentrate to understand. I think we must both seek therapy and find Deaf groups to partake in activities.

It’s hard sometimes for sure. I promise you are not alone. There’s still so much beauty and joy to experience.

I feel your pain...I have had many days of feeling ""stupid""! We are not stupid...we are just a little unfortunate.  WE ARE BEAUTIFUL AND WE ARE LOVED! Everyone has bad days...thats when we have to be strong! Keep your head up high :)
For so many years I felt so isolated, I recently just discovered that there is Live Transcibe on my cell phone.
Go to settings, accessibility, hearing enhancements and click on Live Transcribe.
I use it all the time now (shortcut on the front page of my phone) and it has helped me tremendously! I can now hear conversations at the dinner table, out with friends/family, I use it at my Drs appts and in the car! I have missed out on so much but this has given me a feeling of being included now! I hope this helps take some of that pain away. 
Remember...Not everyone will understand the battle we face but don't let those bring you down.  Big hugs to you! :)

You keep your chin up! You are very articulate and what you are coping with is totally normal and understandable. You are definitely not stupid. You have a good way with words. I’ve been where you are at and I understand how frustrating it is. I want you to try to be positive and hang in there!

I feel you, what you are experiencing is something I can relate to.

Don’t take these experiences too personally, they aren’t you and just a reaction you experience. I was bitter about what I didn’t have for the longest time, but later I realized how it didn’t really bother me.

I think having hearing loss and facing the world shows people who they are sooner. In a way it’s helped me realize there are people who are genuinely kind and considerate and others who put their selves over others. In a way hearing loss has also given me a third eye, and I cherish that as my empathy and understanding of others has deepened.

🫂

I am hearing impaired. 
If sometimes I have problems with my ears like infection or something when I hear even worse my mood is down.
People like us should have access to mental health therapy if you ask me because world can be cruel to us...

I am sure we all have similar experinces

I'm sorry you feel this way.

I almost went crazy after my sshl episode that lasted 4 months. You must be crazy strong because you dealt with this for such a long time.

Focus on what you can and do enjoy instead of what you can't enjoy.  I can't hear the birds but I can see the sunset.

The simplest thing was the most significant for me. Being able to sleep in silence (or near enough)
Being able to turn off hearing your partner snore. Not hearing the loud ass plow truck go by. ✨AMAZING ✨

I understand how you feel.
I felt the same when I became deaf overnight at 33.

It's good to acknowledge these feelings of anger.

Leave no stone unturned to improve your life.

With time comes acceptance.

I lost my hearing later in life and I was so pissed off. I hated not hearing the world. Then someone told me to experience the world using my other senses. 
When you wake up pay attention to the things you see and feel. I’m so grateful I can see my how my bunnies hops up to me every morning without fail. I pay more attention to how he looks at me. I feel how soft he is. I see the smiles on peoples faces as they walk by or the emotions they feel. I can feel how busy the world is by the way the air feels around me. The colors on peoples clothes as they move around, the colors of hair people have and the way their face moves when they speak to me. A persons face is so detailed and I hadn’t noticed that before. I don’t hear their voice but I see how beautiful everyone is and unique each person is. I can tell who is coming up the stairs based on how people walk. The way someone carries themselves day to day tells me so much about them that words could never. 

Do I miss the laughter of children playing? The birds in the trees? Of music playing. Auditorily sure. But I can see these things happening. I can see joy. I can feel nature and witness a talented musician in their craft while feeling their music go through my entire body. 

Its all about perspective

I feel you :( I wish I was normal too 😭 it’s hard for me being hard of hearing and I do wish there was a way to fix it. I hope you find peace and a way to accept yourself and enjoy life 🤍

I bet you are really good at reading lips.

So sorry you feel this way. Don’t forget there is a community that loves you. Feel free to reach out to them ❤️

I can relate, the minute people find out I'm deaf, their first reaction is that I'm stupid. This comes from the phrase ""Deaf and Dumb"" they are ignorant of the fact that ""Dumb"" means unable to speak. It has nothing to do with intelligence. As a matter of fact, Hearing people do a lot of stupid things.

this post encapsulates what i feel everyday, glad im not alone in this.

I command your ears to hear..


Such transferred powers part of my wish for you

1isfyad,hardofhearing,HOH Character?,"Hello reader, I am here to ask help. I'm attempting to write a character that is deaf in one ear. He was born that way and he is training to become an [assassin.So](http://assassin.So) what I want to know is what are the specific struggles you face as someone who is heard of hearing? I am a hearing person.

[댓글]
I had a total loss of hearing in one ear. It was very difficult to deal with because your brain does not understand that one ear is not working. 

If you drop your keys, your head automatically turns toward the sound. If one ear does not work, you are uncertain where the sound is coming from, and you don't know which direction to turn.

Another example. I'm standing outside the hospital, and there is a dog across the street barking. My working ear is facing the hospital, and my deaf ear is facing the dog. Although my eyes tell me the dog is across the street, my ears are telling me that the dog is inside the hospital. It's an absolute horror feeling. I had to question my senses and my sanity.

Thankfully, I have recovered enough to tell left and right again. But it also resulted in a very bad case of tinnitus that has been ringing non-stop for the last 10 years. It's made sound recognition very difficult.

I call it my gift from Uncle Sam, thanking me for my military service.🤨

Why do you feel the need to write a character with a disability you have no experience with?

Also, it's considered gauche to ask for this sort of work for free. You should hire a sensitivity consultant who has no hearing in one ear and have them help you for pay.

A couple things that may make interesting aspects to your character.

1) my sister always tells me I remind her of Jason Bourne because every new room or environment I'm walking into she thinks I'm casing the place, but I'm just trying to orient myself to where I want to sit/stand for optimal ear placement. It's been pointed out that it would be an assassin's weakness to not know where sound is coming from. However, that innate ability to instantly case a place due to having to familiarize oneself with a place since being a kid would work to their benefit when preparing for a hit.


2) I recently switched careers and became a therapist. During my practicum, my colleagues and supervisors continually pointed out my advanced ability to read non verbal cues, body language, facial expression. Since I can't hear very well, I learned how to fill the gaps with all our other communication going on. That would be another innate skill an assassin would want.

Difficulty with directional hearing, so there's gonna be hyper focus on environment especially since it's difficult to tell where gunshots, cars and conversations are happening.



pros
more sensitive to body language since that gives out the cues to the topic of conversation - is it anger, concern, curiosity, happiness? 

Easier to adapt to lip reading to compensate 

excuse to wear electronics where it could be forbidden as a radio receiver or to hide a bug before planting it.

using sign language to convey more flexible silent conversations than just assigned military jargon

question: is it acquired later in life or by birth?

acquired makes one frustrated because the brain misplaces the sound to a different spot until it adapts 

birth makes it so brain doesn't have directional hearing, only volume and preferences to face people a certain way to catch the sounds.

Other comments have covered the main points, as someone with the same issue I forget people can hear out of both ears! I'll be watching a movie and I'll be like ""that person's on their left side how can they hear them"" and then I realise ;) think my brain just rewired itself. Also how stressful large groups and social situations are, having to orient myself so my good ear can pick up most of the group and praying I don't have to sit in between people. Having to turn your head a lot of someone is on your deaf side, sometimes just guessing what they said to avoid being awkward.

If your character is an assassin, I imagine not being able to know what direction sound is coming from would be the most important issue. Assuming they don't have hearing aids, maybe they learn to compensate for their disability? Don't need to hear to shoot straight after all

I think one of the biggest things would be locating sounds. It’s incredibly difficult to locate sounds with 2 different hearing levels. For me I have mild-severe hearing in my right hear but normal in my left and I often struggle to locate sounds. Most of my family has a similar impairment and my sister doesn’t, and one time she walked in a room we were all in and turned off a noise and we were all grateful because it was bothering us but we couldn’t find it. Another thing, for me at least, would be the fear of my hearing being damaged. My hearing has already gone down slightly since birth and I’m always scared it’s going down more. Another thing, not sure if this would be relevant to the book, is that whenever I’m sick my hearing often gets worse.",2025-02-18 15:58:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1isfyad/hoh_character/

1irycy9,hardofhearing,Hearing loss used to gaslight,"Wondering if anyone can relate to this. Sometimes it feels like my hearing loss is used to gaslight me. A couple examples might be someone mentions something and I say I didn’t know about it. They will insist they told me. I ask, did I respond when you told me? No response. They are well aware I have hearing loss. Or, this person will sometimes respond to something I said and I clearly don’t hear it. Then when I ask for them to repeat they become frustrated. Other times when I ask if they responded and I didn’t hear them they literally chose to ignore me. How am I supposed to know? Again, well aware of my hearing loss. Also I swear sometimes they intentionally speak quietly so I don’t hear, although I can’t prove it. One final example will be telling me I misheard something when what I heard upset me. I had asked for the person to repeat themselves because I was pretty sure I heard the first time, and the second time confirmed. Then they were upset because I expressed frustration because what they said was argumentative and came back later to tell me I misheard/misunderstood. Idk because it’s harder to misunderstand tone and body language, but again hard to prove. Anybody have similar experiences or advice?

Yep. Sounds like my entire childhood. 

Born with a hearing loss. Uses hearing aids.. 

I have learned both  healthy coping skills and unhealthy coping skills. 

Healthy is just to remind my self that if a person doesn't explain or state again they ain't worth my effort as a friend. Just merely acciqntices. 

And unhealthy skills is to gaslight them back until they realize that they are being gaslight and then I say sucks to be gaslight.. if you don't like it then stop doing it me. Then walk away. Not even giving them the chance to say or do anything.

Unfortunately, people are unpleasant towards hearing disabled people, they don't understand or care and would rather make you feel like the problem. If they aren't super close to you or vital to your survival, I would suggest considering if they are really someone you want in your life. Boundaries are essential for disabled people, do not let people believe that you're an easy target to psychologically/emotionally abuse, it makes for an even more miserable life. If this person refuses to acknowledge their role in the frustration and work with you to find permanent solutions then you have a choice to make, leave or put up with it. I tolerated a lot of crap behaviors growing up and I'd rather be alone at 25 than be surrounded by insidious people. Good luck.

I try to just tell myself that if someone isn't doing the smallest thing to help me understand them when I can't hear them, they do not care about me and I shouldn't put any effort in with them. It's so hard for me to remove myself from some people so I'm not one to talk, but hopefully, soon I will.

It also just makes me question why it's so hard for non disabled people to accommodate to other people that need simple accommodations (obviously, that's a long unanswered question) but all in all it's bc they don't have any respect for you

And the only reason I'm saying that is because even if it's on purpose or not, I hope you get out of that situation as fast as possible. (I'm sure they are doing it on purpose)

It's gotten to the point that if someone does something like whisper to me or talk from a different room, I get annoyed with them or dont even say anything. Why is it so hard for them to remember to accommodate us. Usually I tell people that if I don't respond to you and you don't ask again, that's your problem, not mine

Very similar experiences! Strangers and even family will take my mishearing them as me ignoring them. Also several times, me asking people to repeat themselves has been taken as some kind of micro aggression or worse, an invitation to argue. The most common for me is asking waiters to repeat themselves. I get a weird look *almost* every time

Yup, and I don’t have advice on how to deal with it other than drop those bastards. Ultimately, get people who would mistreat you for any reason out of your life. They don’t deserve your time and energy.

All I can say is: Same!

Same here. It’s such a struggle!!

Yes, they are. I'm not going to speculate on if it's on purpose or not, even though I want to—as it shouldn't matter. All YOU can do is your best, and you're already doing that. (I can tell).

What helped me is seeing it as THEIR job, their responsibility to make sure you heard. If you didn't hear it might as well not exist and you can blame them for it—and you should. No more ""but I told you""s! If you didn't hear, they haven't said it. Don't doubt yourself: doubt them. 

I know that all is MUCH easier said than done... But they're excluding you, isolating you, brainwashing you and making you doubt yourself. You're doing that more than enough already being HoH: you definitely cannot use somebody else making it worse!

*You have a right to get angry.*
*You have a right to treat them like they're crazy if they claim you heard something you didn't.*
*You have a right to trust in what you *can* hear.*

I have the same issue and used a wired mono earbud. I got Galaxy Buds for Christmas and they have mono mode if you only take one out of the case.

I love the 2 boom series at dollar tree. I lose them before I use them typically. But every form I've had so far they can be turned upside down and got in my ear comfortably so I can swap out the left and the right earbud and keep it in my preferred ear no matter what. But those are a couple hours of constant use at once but I just swap left and right and go back to my job and it charges before the other bud dies. I've used the brand for about 5 years now. 

If you want a larger quality one JLAB at Walmart is my favorite mid tier brand and some models do the upside down thing too. Then the high end one my husband got for his electrician job was shokz brand bone conductors.

And all of these earbuds do monomode as the default.",2025-02-17 01:27:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ir88lc/wireless_mono_earbud/
1iqxmeh,hardofhearing,Hearing loss increasing,"Hi everyone. I'm (26F) here hoping for some advice. I am hard of hearing because I had bacterial menginitis when I was 6 months old. This caused me losing my hearing completely on the left and I'm hard of hearing in my right. I am wearing a hearing aid in my 'good' ear. Over the years my hearing slowly kept declining. Where at first I only needed my hearing aid at school/work, I now need it at home aswell to hear my fiancé or our tv properly. I mostly hear because of lipreading. In 2022 I got the corona virus which unfortunately added tinnitus. This makes hearing more precisely even more difficult. 

I attached my hearing loss docs in the post. Only of my right ear because I have 0% hearing in my left ear.

The loss of my hearing also is causing a massive drain in my daily energy. Right now I have a job which includes daily multiple phone calls and communication with different departments, coworkers and customers. I am starting to notice I'm getting in survival mode. I come home from work only to recharge for the next day for work. I am looking for a job where verbal communication isn't a recruirement so I can have a balance between work and private time. And I have the feeling I'm doing completely deaf in a few years since my hearing is going down very rapitely.

Does anybody have any recommendations of a job without verbal communication? I can't start my own bussiness. I am looking for an already excisting job. Preferably in NL but any random recommendations and tips are very welcome!

Note: I'm under supervision starting Wednesday to monitor the declining of my hearing more closely.


EDIT: Unfortunatly it didnt add my document. I have hearing range as following: 
Old: 0-40dBSP = 0%. 50dBSP = 15%. 60dBSP: 95% 

Current: 0-50dBSP = 0%. 60dBSP: 45%. 70dBSP: 85%

1iqvzqg,hardofhearing,New to hard of hearing world: advice please! (UK),"I (36F), was diagnosed with mild sensorineural  hearing loss in both ears in Dec 23, with the problem limited to high frequencies. At the time of the initial diagnosis I was 8 months pregnant with my second child and was told that I was in the early stages of hearing loss. The NHS consultant said I would definitely need hearing aids at some point but that it could be 5-10 years before my hearing deteriorated to the point where I needed them. I was advised to get hearing tests annually to track progression of the hearing loss.

I’ve just had another hearing test and it looks as though I’ve progressed to the very top of moderate (as opposed to mild) hearing loss for high frequencies. The audiologist said I was now eligible for NHS hearing aids if I wanted them. From my perspective I feel like the hearing loss isn’t yet affecting my day to life significantly but the audiologist said that if I was going to get hearing aids then it was better sooner rather than later so that it’s not as big an adjustment (as opposed to later when I presume the difference would be greater). 

My questions are:

- what is the quality of hearing aids available on the NHS?
-is it worth paying more to get a better quality?
- what sort of things should I be considering when getting a hearing aid for the first time?
- how did you find wearing hearing aids for the first time?

Thanks to all!

[댓글]
If you have a moderate loss, you’re missing way more than you realize. 

Some things to bear in mind. A lot of people quit using their hearing aids in the first month. They can be overwhelming at first. Commit to giving them a good 3 months before deciding if they are not for you. 

Build up to them. When I have a decrease in hearing and have to have them adjusted higher, I will wear them 4 hours a day, then 6, then 8, then 12.  I don’t wear them past 12 hours because by then I desperately need a break. 🤣

If you are eligible for NHS hearing aids, just do it. 

They will make a huge difference to your life. 

I have NHS hearing aids are they are fantastic. The after care is great where I am, obviously that may vary depending on location. As another said, you tend to just use them in certain situations initially then build up over time. The pandemic made me realise how much I subconsciously relied on lip reading. Once people were were wearing masks, I had to go full time on them and haven't looked back. 

I have open hearing aids, and they just add in the higher frequencies to the other sound I can hear naturally. I would expect you would have the same. They sound a little weird at first, and you may go back to the audiologist to retune a couple of times. The NHS will replace your hearing aids every 3 years.

Being able to hear the TV properly and being able to pick out voices in noisy situations were the 2 biggest wins for me. 

I just got a new set a few weeks ago and they can stream audio from your phone, such as phone calls, Spotify, the radio etc. It does sound a bit tinny as they are not headphones, but I love listening to the football commentary on the sly when no one knows.

Book an appointment. You won't regret it.

I don’t live in the UK so I can’t answer the first question, but I can answer the other two. I think it’s worth thinking about how loud you really want the world to be. I don’t wear my hearing aid because of how loud and robotic it is. It will not be like normal hearing. I don’t remember my first time with my hearing aid because I was six, but I can tell you I find it way too loud and robotic. The way it sounds is kind of mentally and I struggle to keep it in my ear. The mold (the part in the ear) never fits right and is often uncomfortable. It is nice to be able to amplify ppl whenever I want, but I personally don’t find it worth it.",2025-02-16 16:30:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1iqvzqg/new_to_hard_of_hearing_world_advice_please_uk/
1iqf5dn,hardofhearing,I wore my headphones to sleep and now i cannot hear out of my right ear,"As the title reads, i wore them to sleep a few days ago (on Friday), i was listening to brown noise (i usually do this and ive never had any problems) and now its been two days and i cannot hear out of my right ear. It feels like its under water or when your ears need to pop when on a plane but you cant.
A couple hours ago ive started hearing a small heartbeat in my ear too.

Im calling my doctors in the morning about this cause im getting extremely worried about it.

The headphones may have caused wax to warm up and form a plug. When this happens to me, I use a syringe(sans needle!) with warm water, check water temperature is warm, NOT hot, test on inner wrist. Lean my head down on the blocked side, then gently inject into my ear canal. Any wax comes out immediately, clearing any wax blockage. Ensure to drain fully by keeping your head leant over for a minute or so. Over 50 years experience doing this &amp; never had a problem.

I wouldn't worry too much it's most likely just compacted ear wax they'll probably prescribe some ear drops to loosen the wax.

Alternatively you could just go to your local pharmacy and buy some.

Get some Sudafed in the meantime to try to dry out any fluid that could be in it. I just had an ear infection last week and it did the same thing

The sudden loss of hearing is considered a medical emergency as there is often only a short time window for any required treatment to be effective, after that you may, even with treatment, end up with a permanent hearing loss. Hence it is very important for you to have a consultation with an ENT specialist as soon as possible, **do not delay!**

Haha, I have this same exact problem, though it's nearly returned, ear drops and soft massaging will sort it out, but yeah it's nearly returned, hope you're doing well.",2025-02-15 23:57:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1iqf5dn/i_wore_my_headphones_to_sleep_and_now_i_cannot/

Mild hearing loss across most frequencies in the right ear, middle frequencies in the left ear. Good news is your speech recognition is perfect so you should be an excellent candidate for hearing aids if you want to go that route.

This is what my hearing was like 35 years ago and I would caution you on starting hearing aids at this point given the amazing word recognition. I suspect they further damaged my hearing because they just amplify sounds essentially. 

I would wait to see if yours gets worse or stabilizes. When you get to my level of hearing loss, even with the best most expensive hearing aids, you, un-aided, have perfect hearing in comparison. If you're frustrated now, just wait. 

Hearing aids are not a cure, by any means. There are a few audiologists on here who would say otherwise. Of course I'm completely dependent for survival on my hearing aids at this point, I'm not saying they are useless. I would just wait and see what your hearing does.",2025-02-14 18:45:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1iphq54/first_hearing_test/
1ip3hhk,hardofhearing,There's nothing wrong with my ears but I still have trouble hearing and it's affecting my life.,"Hi so I (20F) first realised that I have trouble hearing back when I was 14 years old. I was in class, and I realised I couldn't make out what my classmates were saying. 

Then covid happened so I didn't have to go out and this issue was just buried until I started college and I realised it had gotten worse than before. I couldn't make out the words and it sounded all gibberish. After that I visited one ENT, who referred an audiologist and that test showed that I have mild SNHL. But after consulting another ENT, he said that the previous report was wrong and I redid the tests including a BERA test that showed I have 0 problems with my hearing. Infact the report showed that I have really good hearing.  

But of course my issue wasn't resolved. My college years have been downright depressing and bad. I barely go to college because I have difficulty understanding others. 

I consulted another ENT who has done his fellowship from Oxford and after listening to my symptoms he concluded that it had to be APD. I wanted hearing aids and I went to Amplifon, who retested me and yesterday she concluded that my reports are normal and since my BERA test is normal, I cannot have APD. 

I'm absolutely devastated rn. I thought there was a conclusive end but I'm back to square one. The audiologist at Amplifon said that it might be due to stress and anxiety which is immense in my life. 

I do not know what to do. I feel like there's no end to this. I do not even know if anxiety meds will help with this. 
Has any one here ever dealt with something like this? 

[댓글]
You probably done a lot of google to find rare. Could it be one of those things where when you are in a controlled place you like the docrs or audiologist. You can hear but if the background noise are there that can override whatever is that you can't make out?

BERA was what i was put through to diagnose me with CAPD, thank you for letting me know the name. i was young so i was never told what the electrode things were for.

i would just keep pushing. it may not be CAPD but it could be something else or some other form of brain damage or hearing damage. i really hope a doc can solve this for you.

I totally understand how you feel; I'm 20 too and had a lot of trouble initially finding out what was wrong with me. Right now, you've done all the right steps in regards to finding an ENT and moving on to an audiologist for more conclusive answers. Do you happen to have any of your audiograms/test results? We might be able to break them down and see if there's anything significant standing out. Hearing tests are never going to be 100% accurate, so it's completely possible one test had you dipping down into the mild territory whereas another may have been just bordering it.

I would also post on askdoc reddit, as well, fyi.

A BERA test shouldn’t be used as a complete diagnosis for APD. I would get further testing done by other individuals and go from there. You are your biggest advocate unfortunately and not all doctors/audiologists etc are created equal. I would try not to take this as a setback and just book some more appointments. 

You got this!

[removed]

Maybe a morbid question but: Have they/ you thought of brain damage yet?

As a woman who has experienced chronic illness, i'm well used to doctors calling everything anxiety, but your experience really takes the cake. Just because they can't find the reason doesn't mean you're not experiencing partial deafness!  Anxiety does not cause deafness! 


I started having the exact same symptoms you're describing when Covid started. Couldn't hear someone speaking if there was background noise, and sometimes just couldn't hear it even if there wasn't. People sounded like the Charlie Brown teacher... I actually came upon your post trying to Google 'did a lot of people find out they were partially deaf when people started wearing masks?' And I found out that they did, and that many people, myself included, didn't know they were relying on lip-reading, and that mysterious partial deafness shot up after Covid. This is not a coincidence. 


Anti-anxiety drugs might make you feel better about not being able to hear right, but they aren't going to do anything for your hearing. I suspect that this issue is caused by damage to the nerves plus long-standing crud in our ears and sinuses. 


Don't give up, and don't let these 'doctors' make you feel like you're crazy. You aren't. I've had some improvement taking antibiotics and herbs like boneset and wormwood, aka treating it like an infection, because it is, at least in my case. Praying for you to find answers!!

1indmmw,hardofhearing,am i going crazy? need help with hearing,"I going crazy? long term hearing loss, Can anyone point me in the right direction


i’m currently 22 years old, and honestly regret every step of this “hearing loss” journey. i’m trying to look for answers, but can’t seem to find any at any turn. the hearing issues started at a young age (maybe 11-12?) after i had continuously done the valsalva method (for no reason) I thought the feeling of air filling my ears (or that’s what it feels like at least) was cool, and after i did it this one time, i felt my hearing literally get worse from that instant, albeit marginally (i didn’t really understand what it was, as i was so young)

but i brushed it off. for so long. and i kept “popping” my ears (which is what it feels like), however now, i don’t even need to clog my nose, open my mouth, or anything. I can just do it whenever i want to, and because of that, it’s become a habit that i can’t seem to break anymore. every single day, i was “popping” my ears like this, and still do (albeit i am finally trying to make a conscious effort to do it less)

But every single year, especially around the winter, it gets worse. **PERMANENTLY.** I really started to notice it in freshman year of high school. i got sick once, felt my sinuses and everything clog up for while. my ears do this ringing thing with slight pain for like 2-3 minutes max, then when it all ends, my hearing just seems worse. the thing is, when i’m sick like this, i can’t even blow my nose - it feels like there’s tons of pressure or something, and i can’t “regulate the pressure” well.

but it also happens randomly during the year even when i don’t get sick, which drives me nuts. 

the weird thing is, it really hits the sound of my own voice - that being, i can’t hear the MYSELF well. like when I speak, it sounds like my own voice is far away. it used to feel like it was coming “from myself”, now it almost feels like i’m hearing someone else talk when i speak, almost as if it’s not coming from my mouth. now, at 22 years old, it’s gotten to the stage where other hearing (excluding my own voice) has deteriorated tremendously as well.

just last week, it seemed to get worse again, this time to the point where when I drop something even next to my ear, it doesn’t directly sound “next” to it, more so a little further away where the sound doesn’t seem to “directly” hit my ears, if it makes sense..

the craziest thing about this is that no ENT is agreeing with what i’m saying. they’re saying my hearing is fine, and all it looks like is that my nose is inflamed or whatever / allergic symptoms. i’ve been prescribed allergy medicine, even visited TMJ doctors / took hearing test, to 0 avail. the tests say i’m okay. i swear it is getting worse. 

i just want to know what’s wrong with me. it has become a horrible habit to continuously “pop” my ears throughout the entirety of the day, which i can’t really stop and it is driving me crazy.

i’ve tried chatgpt and they give me such a wide variety of responses from:
chronic eustachian tube disorder, patulous eustachian tube, middle ear dysfunction (otosclerosis, tympanic membrane abnormalities) - given the fact that both external sounds and my own voice sounds are dropping, it says it could be conductive / sensorineural hearing loss.

i might be too late so im really scared but im trying my best not to lose my hearing and im freaking out. if anyone has any ideas of next steps, please let me know. i took hearing tests and they always said it seemed within range / a little above, but trying to get amother referral so I can go get it looked at again. it makes no sense. 

I can definitely add test results once i get them - prior ones all showed hearing in normal / ok ranges so i don’t have any older ones on hand. i think i can definitely ask for past results back though, but am trying to book an ENT fast, but dont really know what else to ask / look for other than a hearing test, which i’ve done a bunch of times.

I am begging for any help or any information from anybody dealing with something similar. I did an apple hearing test and it says little to no loss in both 

tl;dr: 
hearing loss, both external noises and own voice, a lotttt of volume drop on my own voice (people tell me i’m loud a lot, need to be more quiet, etc
-some “deep” pain in ear time to time, usually random
-can pop my own ears on will, literally whenever i want and I do it hundreds of times a day (actively trying to stop)
-been happening for 10 years now. been looking for answers, pre-gpt didn’t see any related forums talking about people losing the ability to hear themselves well
-audio tests seem okay on paper, registers as no / little loss even though i am sure it’s immense",2025-02-12 00:06:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1indmmw/am_i_going_crazy_need_help_with_hearing/
1inbo6x,hardofhearing,Now that things have calmed down!,"Hi everyone!

It's been almost 4 months since I lost a moderate amount of hearing in my right ear. I wanted to explain what happened now that it's over just in case it's helpful for anyone. 

My hearing loss with profound sudden loss was coupled with a migraine. I thought it was fine because I've had migraines before so I just went to bed (stupid of me). My hearing came back somewhat so I didn't go to the dr for 3 days. My biggest tip is GO TO THE ER IF YOU GET SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. I could've saved some of my hearing had I got on high dose prednisone sooner. 

Anyway, eventually got extreme ear pain (I mean 10/10 pain and vertigo that caused me to faint and vomit). I got diagnosed with shingles of the face and ear by my emergency ENT but only after 3 ER trips for pain. They made me get a spinal tap. It really sucked. 

Put on Gabapentin and Dilaudid for a bit. Healed in a month. I've had 2 hearing tests since and hearing was mild loss in right ear and then moderate after I fully healed. I don't use a hearing aid though. I had a lot of panic attacks because I couldn't really function in crowds but now I'm used to it and I'm fine. 

I feel great. It's kind of funny that I get to go on airplanes first now? But my life hasn't changed all that much except I can't hear people unless I'm looking at them and I can get overwhelmed in certain situations (airports and movie theatres especially). Otherwise life is good. I felt a lot of despair and fear but I almost forget what it was like to hear everything I guess? I don't miss it. Would of course like it back but that's just the way it goes sometimes. 

It feels nice to find some community in people who are also HoH. I try to focus on what I've gained which is people who understand!",2025-02-11 22:39:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1inbo6x/now_that_things_have_calmed_down/

1in4emo,hardofhearing,Help with Ear Pressure/Ringing,"Hello,

Recently I went to see an ENT related to sharp ear pain when flying. The ENT extracted built up ear wax from both my ears. Both ears were extremely painful when the ENT was scraping the wax out. The left ear was much easier to work with, and all the wax was removed. However, the right ear was a lot worse. The ENT made multiple attempts at scraping and suctioning it out, getting 3/4 of the wax out. 

He recommended me to use Debrox for 4 days to get the remaining wax out, as the wax is very dry inside my ear canal. 

Using Debrox now for a couple days, my ear has progressively gotten more clogged and now I hear a slight ringing. It feels like I have water in my ear and it’s build up, causing an uncomfortable constant pressure. 

To note, before going to the ENT, I had no pain, discomfort or ringing in either ear. I ultimately came in to see how I can solve my ear pain when flying. 

How can I eliminate my right ear pressure and remaining wax? Are there any other alternative measures than Debrox? Should I just go to my local Urgent Care and have them flush it out? ",2025-02-11 17:43:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1in4emo/help_with_ear_pressureringing/
1imnreq,hardofhearing,Can Tympanoplasty really restore hearing?,"Hi everyone,

**Background:**

My right ear lost hearing when I was a toddler, around age 5, after falling off a bed. The doctor in my home country diagnosed it as damage to my eardrum. Since then, I've lived without much issue, using only my left ear to hear.

However, things have started to change in the past year, especially now that I'm working. I find myself having to pay extra attention in the workplace, particularly when someone speaks from my right. Sometimes, I need to ask people to repeat themselves because I can't hear them well. This has become very frustrating. Some of my colleagues think my English isn't good enough, but the truth is, it's hard to hear clearly from the right side, even in my native language.

**Question:**

I'm now considering seeing a doctor. I understand that it's different for everyone and depends on many factors, but my main question is: **Does Tympanoplasty truly restore hearing?** Are there any success stories in this subreddit? Or is it just not worth the time and effort?

My biggest fear is that the surgery may not improve my hearing, and I'll only experience the negative side effects. Can anyone please share their experiences or advice on this?

1ily2bo,hardofhearing,Android 15 &amp; Bluetooth Hearing Aids.,"I have an old Android phone. My hearing aids (Phonak) used to ring even if my phone was set to silent. This is something that I prefer.

My issue is that after upgrading to a Pixel 9 Pro phone, which currently has Android 15 installed, I can only hear my phone ring through my hearing aids when my phone is set to 'silent off'. So, the phone rings as well as my hearing aids.

As far as I know, when I set 'silent on', both phone and hearing aids are silent.

I don't know whether this is a phone issue or an Android change. Or whether there is an app that can give me some flexibility?

I'm a university lecturer and I've never been able to tell where sound is coming from. In class a student will respond to a question and I turn my head the opposite direction to look for them. I had this issue as long as I can remember, and while it never used to bother me, it's getting more frustrating at work and it seems to be worse than it used to be (though that may not be true). Recently a student with a mask 5 feet from me in the front row was talking to me and I was looking all over the back of the room to find them. Of course when I asked ""Who said that?"" they said ""Me"" which made it easy to make light of things and move on.

I have had my hearing checked before - my partner is a pretty soft talker and I was concerned about hearing loss with her regularly heaving to repeat herself. It turns out my hearing is just fine, at least according to the tests, and she's just on the quiet side. I considered that maybe I was hard of hearing in one ear, leading to lack of stereo, but both ears seem to be doing the job just fine when I raise my hand for the beeps at the doctor's office.

What could be causing this, and is there something I can do to either mitigate the effects or prevent it from growing worse (if it is indeed worsening)?

I have Central auditory processing disorder from head trauma and this is one of my symptoms. I cannot orientate sound in real life in directions. There's a lot of other symptoms that come with it, and it's kind of a learning disability and a hearing disorder, but you should try speaking to an audiologist about it. They will refer you to a neurological Clinic that will test you for it

Not a professional, worth looking into auditory processing disorder.

Just recently, it has been suggested that COVID-19 could lead to APD, but links are still being investigated.

I am hard of hearing g, wear bilateral hearing aids and can’t figure out where the ambulance siren is coming from too!

Being able to hear better in one ear than the other can cause this. Only way to confirm is to see an audiologist. If that's the cause, the way to mitigate it is by wearing hearing aids programmed to even this out.

Your dr is better equipped to advise you on what could be causing that issue. To an extent your experience is the lecture hall isn’t actually abnormal even for people who aren’t hard of hearing. If you’re concerned about your hearing you can always get tested again.

Why not ask them to stand up when they ask their questions or at least raise their hand. Before I lost my hearing, I had trouble telling where sound came from.",2025-02-09 23:36:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ilsl9o/difficulty_telling_the_direction_of_sounds/

""It impares communication on the line"". NO MOTHERFUCKERS IT IS MY HEARING AID!!! Being able to have soft English sentences in the back geound means I can pick up on the words being said and contextso much easier. I have a normal millenial's amount of hearing loss from concerts n headphones and things but aphasia from a head injury. This is a hearing aid. I'm so angry. This is the first fast food job (including these same business a decade ago) that has ever denied me. If I needed a leg brace, or a normal hearing aid no one would question it but since it's a brain injury I'm undeserving of being a functional human. Days I can use it I go home with enough energy to make dinner and do laundry. Days I don't have it I go home and crash nap or have a meltdown because I've used so much more energy fighting my brain all day. 

My manager got a call from the franchiser today to address this. She told me in no uncertain terms (as exact as I can remember): 
• I won't fire you. 
• I won't fire you so you can get disability. 
• You won't get anything out of us (I don't need unemployment I need accomidation). 
• I will question you about it every time I see you with a drive thru headset on (I hide the earbud under it as often as I can) and it does not interfere). 
• I'm trying to be on your side but you're making it hard.
• I did tell the franchiser about the difference I noticed when you have it and when you don't.

I'm in my car having an absolute meltdown after leaving early for that panic attack that came after the conversation. I just want to revert to unhealthy copes so bad right now (cutting, alcohol, etc). I am so very angry and frustrated. 

Why am I less of a person? Why are they denying federal law and a Neuro psychologist (brain functionality expert) ? I'm so exhausted. I can't do most jobs because of the hearing and a few other issues that come with the tbi. I found fast food is the most functional work sphere though I've had at least 15 jobs in 10 years trying to make it work. I started applying for ssdi in 2021. I'm still fighting for it. I'm certain it's only for my age they are denying me. I attached an image of my MRI from my TBI (image 2019 I believe). 

Kinda wanna die. But mostly know that's not a solution, I've battled suicidal ideation for basically my whole life
 I'm happily married and won't do that to my husband. And if a horse to head didn't kill me, and a status epilepticus episode for 10+ minutes didn't kill me, I certainly won't let this fucking job do it. I just needed to vent to people who get it.

If you need headphones to hear, time to get an actual audiogram from an audiologist and get some actual hearing aids if audiogram suggests for one. 

Headphones are in no way hearing aids. That's where you're getting the push back.

Was the audiologist you saw trained in audiological processing disorders? It might not be exactly your diagnosis, but finding a team of audiologist, slp, neurologist might be a better fit for your treatment.

What exactly are you asking for? Aidpods with the OTC hearing aid function? Or just regular headphones?

Have you opened a case with your state’s vocational rehab office? They can make recommendations for accommodations and advocate for you. They were also able to pay for my hearing aids and free job training.

This sounds exhausting. I’m sorry!

When my daughter was struggling to get reasonable accommodation and they denied her request but agreed that she's hard of hearing. She request an OT evaluate of the work environment.  Her company hired someone they thought would back them up. It back fired and they had the OT bill and needed to buy the adaptive equipment. The OT made them get medical grade, at 10x the cost.

Really don't like the sound of your Audiologist.  Epilepsy is intermixed with the cause of my daughters hearing loss.  It should be in 101 Audiology that TBI can cause audio issues and sometimes hearing loss.

My daughters neurology office is filled with people that use bone conduction headset.  It sound like they reduce some of the hearing stress or maybe its a different part of your brain that processes bone conduction?? Sorry if my randomness isn't helpful.  Your situation is challenging and many of us can relate.  It's normal to deal with ignorant, think they know everything people.       

You should have the rights to ask for ASL interrupter for medical appointments.  My daughter prefers closed captioning and that now my preference because most of it's done remotely. But you need to use what works for you. This might help with the aphasia. And hopefully help you feel more confident about your treatment.  Plus it make any audiology think about what they're doing.  I'm guessing you present as normal to your last one and they were horrible and didn't dig deeper.

man fuck those guys. there is zero good faith in their arguments, and they're transparent about that fact that they themselves suck.

1ik176k,hardofhearing,Hoh girl,"I recently had an interview for an administrative position at a hotel in Qatar. Everything went well, and I shared that I am half deaf and use a cochlear implant. The HR representative mentioned they would discuss it with the manager and asked me to send them my hearing test report. However, just a few hours later, I received a rejection. I’m left wondering if this had anything to do with my hearing condition.

Because they asked to send them a hearing report, I would say yes it had to do with your disability.
You don't need to let them know of your disability in the interview. If you can do the interview successfully, expect you can do the job successfully. Once you get in to the job, ask for any necessary accommodations. 
Many workplaces don't want to go through the hassle of accommodating disabilities, so will simply decline you early on if you tell them.

I wonder if it had to do with certain things that required hearing. And if your hearing loss is under then it could jeopardize that kind of work.... (🤷) 

I also don't know what the laws in Qatar are. If Google search could help.

It’s possible they rejected you because of your disability. I usually mention it at the end of my interviews after having a long conversation so that they realise that my hearing loss hardly affects my communication with people",2025-02-07 17:58:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ik176k/hoh_girl/

If you actually have fluid in your ears, ear tubes will solve the problem. Also ask your ENT about Eustachian Tube dilation.

Have you seen an ear-nose-throat physician yet?

You could try seeing an otologist or neuro-otologist.  They are specialized in ears, even moreso than an ENT.

Has anyone put a scope down there to see if there's an obstruction, or imaging?  Have tubes ever been suggested?  Those might be worth at least asking about at your appointment.  A hearing test with tympanogram as well.

Placing a comment so I too, can find out. Sorry OP I don't have any helpful suggestions or advice 😅

1iincnd,hardofhearing,Hearing educator looking for resources for HoH student,"Hi there! I'm hearing, I have a bit of knowledge about the Deaf/deaf and HoH community and always want to learn more. I work with an after school program that helps boost literacy and math skills for youth grade 4 - 8, and one of our new students is HoH + uses hearing aids and I know he has some difficulty processing blended letter sounds (sh, th, etc) due to the way his hearing aids process sound. I'm wondering if anyone within the HoH community knows of resources, teaching styles, or has any general advice that might help me facilitate activities for this youth.

Thanks so much in advance and I'm sorry if this isn't the right fit for this sub!

[댓글]
General advice - Make sure when you're speaking to him, he can see your face. If at all possible, minimize ambient noise when you're working with him. We're already straining to hear, and the sounds of music, other people's conversations, etc.. make it very difficult. Basically, check in with him as to where he's sitting, if he needs something repeated, etc... Thank you for asking and being willing to make an extra effort.

Allow him to leave the room during small group work in class. I’m in graduate school right now and whenever we have to do small group work or discuss things with a person sitting next to us, it can get to about 85 decibels and very difficult to hear. I second facing him and speak clearly, not necessarily slower. Closed captioning on videos. Depending on learning style, more visual aids and writing stuff on whiteboard, handouts, etc. 

Less hard surfaces and lower ceilings help too, if you are able to select the room you’re teaching in. This website might also have some additional ideas: https://askjan.org/disabilities/Hearing-Impairment.cfm

You could ask his parents if he has any accommodations that they use at school and what they are.

First, thank you for caring so much. You're a wonderful teacher.  Please let him sit toward the front of the room. Please let him see your mouth move when you speak unless you absolutely have to wear a mask. If he has a cell phone, please allow him to use the caption feature if it has one. Provide written instructions when possible. If you have machinery in the room, please turn it off during instruction.

As a hard of hearing person who wears behind the ear hearing aids and I find that I can hear better when my back is facing a wall.  Only when I'm wearing my aids though.  

I'm not sure if this is just a ""me"" thing but it's something to consider.  It may not work if the hearing aids your student uses sit in the ear itself.

Thanks for reaching out to help your student. :)

I’ve tried pressing against my ear to make a vacuum and holding my nose and blowing, but nothing seems to be working.

You should see an audiologist or ENT specialist to rule out anything more serious

This type of post frustrates me because it is pretty simple : See a doctor.

I would recommend using an oil based ear drop (oil and water don't mix) your eustachian tube sits behind the middle of your ear (behind the ear drum), so unless you have a perforated ear drum or have had a tympanoplasty surgery water wouldn't be an issue there. At my clinic we use proear and my wife had her ears waterclogged and we filled her ear with proear and that pushed the water up and out of her ear and all was fine.",2025-02-03 21:25:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ih0hvn/left_ear_gets_blocked_when_i_immerse_my_head_in/
1igl3ln,hardofhearing,At work I wear a sign on a lanyard saying in big writing “HARD OF HEARING PLEASE SPEAK CLEARLY”,"And yet people look at the sign and still whisper like little church mice to me. 

It’s. 
So. 
Annoying. 

How do you politely make it clear to people you cannot hear? I don’t wear a hearing aid so it’s not immediately obvious I’m deaf. That’s why I thought of wearing the lanyard but yeah people either don’t see it or ignore it! 

[댓글]
Even if you wore a hearing aid, most are virtually invisible. I only struggle with conversations in crowded areas or lots of people, . Youall unfortunately have to keep verbally reminding people :(

Last week I had a coworker who kept whispering to me at work and interrupting me. After asking her to repeat herself and making me lean in about 4 times to try and figure out what she was saying, she laughed out loud and literally said she was gaslighting me and hadn’t been making any sounds. I was so incredibly upset and reported it. 
We’re both lawyers. I’ve worked with the colleague directly for 2 years and she very clearly knows I’m HOH and have hearing aids.

My hearing loss isn’t major. But I work as a sound designer in theatre. A job where people focus on their speaking and volume. 

People are surprisingly unaware of how they speak. Even professional actors who have trained for years have a hard time consciously making themselves louder when on stage. 

For some reason people are remarkably unaware of how they speak and how loud they are.

As a nurse I constantly struggle with this. I have realized after many years that some cultures and families are just much more soft spoken. In addition there are innumerous reasons that someone may be physically unable to speak louder (Parkinson's, stroke, vocal cord issues, throat cancer, etc). Keeping these in mind usually gives me enough patience to be polite and stay calm enough to problem solve. 

At work my most frequently used line is ""I'm sorry I can't understand what you're saying over the noisy TV, sink, alarm, etc."" and then I mute or turn off whatever is loud and ask them to repeat while I'm looking at them and ready to listen. Otherwise I say ""I'm sorry I'm having a hard time hearing and understanding can you please repeat more slowly, loudly"" and then I usually cup my good ear and lean in and hope for the best. If I still can't get it I have them write it type it or get a coworker to help.

People are embarrassed to raise their voice in public. To onlookers, it could appear quite aggressive if you are unaware of the context. 

May I ask why you don't wear hearing aids?

I thought about making a sweatshirt with giant writing on it lol

The sign is polite. Them ignoring it is rude so honestly? I’m at the point where I’m pissed that people expect me to accommodate them not wanting to make any changes to help us communicate. 

I’d ignore them. My lanyard sign says speak clearly and that I’m deaf, if you’re speaking quietly I’m going to act like I don’t hear you, because for all intents and purposes I don’t. That’s what I’d do in head where I’m allowed to be angry and rude. 

Actually, I’d just keep telling them. A lot of people don’t realise they speak quietly. Some people are just rude, but there’s not a lot you can do to change that. Expect daydream about being petty to them

If someone has a problem speaking strongly, you can offer other means of communication, like writing gesturing or anything that would work depending on what you need to communicate about. Voice to text apps, and have them verify the app caught their speech well. They can’t speak too unclearly for that to work.

I know people don’t like the “hearing impaired” phrase over “hard of hearing”, but in my experience using the former has a bit more of a severity modifier in how people perceive it. HOH people just continue as normal. When I’ve used “hearing impaired”, people seem to get it more without further prompting. Not sure why, but that’s been my experience.

I was a front office medical office receptionist. Clients would come in and stand away from the hole in the window. They'd talk through their fingers and I couldn't see their mouths. I wear 2 hearing aids but they're invisible. I put a sign on the glass saying, ""I can't hear you if you cover your mouth."" I retired just before COVID. I wouldn't be able to understand anyone with masks on.

I have noticed that when I say ""hard of hearing"" some people will laugh and say""no worries me too!"" But  definitely not like my level! But saying ""hearing impaired or half deaf"" seems to bring a better response.

I also try to ignore people more so they get used to being louder, like if they say something, and I barely catch it, or like I could tell they said something, instead of reacting/asking to repeat, I just wait until they go louder.

I am a cyclist and wear a neon visibility vest that says ""caution, deaf cyclist"" in huge block letters. And yet, cars and other cyclist routinely run me off narrow roads or pull up angrily next to me screaming obscenities when I don't hear their horns, voices, or bells. 

It amazes me that the first thing people think when you don't respond to their noises is that you are and asshole who is intentionally ignoring them.

I dont have any advice, but i do share your frustration.

My roommate mumbles all the time and gets mad when I say I cant hear them. Ive had people that whisper to each other while I'm right there, even after I say ""I cant hear you"". It makes me paranoid, like theyre trying to test me or like im being mocked. 

Its not a good or healthy thing to do, but honestly, some days I just get so tired of asking folks to speak up or guessing what they're saying that I'll ignore ppl if they dont speak up enough for me to hear them. If they won't put in the effort to allow me to hear them, I won't put in the effort to play their guessing games.

I've worked with a particular colleague for 11 years. She is very well aware that I have hearing loss, yet she still talks quietly when she speaks to me. 
I gave up trying to get her to speak up, I just stopped trying.
So now if she says 'oh but I told you the other day' I just reply 'yeah well I couldn't hear you' 😁",2025-02-03 09:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1igl3ln/at_work_i_wear_a_sign_on_a_lanyard_saying_in_big/

Since the last few days, I have noticed that I am experiencing a crackling sound whenever I swallow. It's weird because let's say if I am eating food and I am engrossed in a discussion or engrossed watching TV, I won't feel it.

However, when I am alone and let's say I swallow my saliva, that's when I hear it. Is this some big issue? Someone I know told me to try something called the Valsalva maneuver, but I didn't find any relief as doing this maneuver blocks the ear for me.

I must also note that when I yawn and swallow immediately after that, I don't hear any crackling. Does anyone know what this is? I would appreciate any help or advice. Thanks.

Maybe some fluid in your ear and you are only noticing when you’re not focusing on something else?

No one here can tell you, we are not doctors, we do not know what is happening with your ears. It could be as simple as wax lodged against your eardrum and movement could be causing the sound, it could be ETD, it could be fluid, etc etc.

You should definitely go see an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist (doctor, PA, or nurse practitioner). You might need a referral, but you really don’t want to mess with your ears. (NO Q-TIPS!)

I had the same. It was my Eustastian(sp?) Tube. It cleared after a few days but it felt horrible.

Any updates?

I know this is an old post, but I also have ear crackling in both ears. I also got diagnosed with vestibular migraines due to taking female hormones for menopause, which messed up my ears and eustachian tubes and triggered these vestibular migraines that make you dizzy that I’ve never had before, and I also got tinnitus in one ear, the same ear as the migraine side and constantly have the tinnitus and crackling ears.

An ENT might be able to help. My first thoughts are infection of some kind, inflammation, or illness. If the problem is persisting, bothersome, or you're concerned about it, it might be a good idea to get checked out by a doctor.

You said you have a wisdom tooth issue on that side. What is the issue? Cavity, broken, coming in, impacted, abscess/infection…?

That tube is very small and goes from middle ear to back of nasal cavity. It helps with drainage from ear, prevent ear infections, and control air pressure in middle ear. This is why your ears sometimes are plugged, “pop”, or uncomfortable when taking off/landing in an airplane (and what often makes babies and kids cry on planes ). I really recommend you do a search on it so you understand more about it. It is normal for it to open and close. It is common to feel effects in it if your sinuses are congested or inflamed.

Perhaps. But I have no way of knowing this is definitely the cause. I really can’t give you any medical advice. Talk to a healthcare professional and also do some research on the tube so you understand more what it might be. Best of luck, I hope all works out well and you feel better soon.",2025-02-02 02:23:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ifmy5k/right_ear_keeps_feeling_like_it_needs_to_pop/
1if0alv,hardofhearing,NHS v Boots hearing care,"I've been profoundly deaf in one ear and severely deaf in the other from birth. All my life I've been provided with hearing aids from the NHS. Last week I had an assessment from the Access to Work scheme (DWP), as I ve struggled to hear in our echoed office for a year now. During this assessment I was amazed how helpful they were, they will provide new hearing aids, software and set up the office with a loop system. Now I have a hearing test at boots hearing care to obtain a quote for new hearing aids for ATW. My question is, are Boots any good? Will I still be with the NHS concurrently with private. I'm worried because many a time NHS have provided aids that didn't sound right, and I was stuck with them whilst waiting months to the next appointment. Can I still keep NHS aids as back up in case the Boots ones are not right for me. Quite anxious about this!

Now I’ve never used hearing aids from boots but I have been tested by a boots audiologist and an nhs audiologist. 

The boots audiologist was very friendly and professional. She explained everything she was going to do and explained what the next steps were.

An audiologist needs to look at it. I’d guess that, like me and many others, you have narrow ear canals and will occasionally need a doctor to clean things out a bit. I had a similar popping sensation before having my ears cleaned professionally but they’ll also obviously rule out anything else

1iegmx6,hardofhearing,Advice on customer service as someone who’s HOH?,"Hi! I (17F) started developing hearing loss within the past few months. It’s become a problem, especially as a café worker. My job gets loud and chaotic, so communicating with customers is difficult for me. I often find myself asking customers to repeat themselves and they tend to get irritated by it. Deeper &amp; soft voices are harder for me, and I’ve had MANY occasions where they get verbally aggressive due to me not hearing them.

I’ve considered buying a “I am hard of hearing” pin for my apron, but I don’t feel super comfortable expressing it publicly.. 
So, is anyone else in the same boat? Any advice? Thanks! :)

[댓글]
I think buying a pin would be awesome! If i can’t hear someone in a work setting I just preface with I’m sorry, I am hard of hearing do you mind speaking a little louder for me? I’ll lean forward, turn my head etc. so they see that i’m trying. (even if its a one time encounter) TYPICALLY all attitude is dropped unless they think it’s a joke 🫠 

I am deaf in one ear so I ALWAYS turn my head regardless of the situation. And if i really can’t hear someone I make sure someone in the same space is aware that I may grab them for help.

Do you have hearing loss in both ears? Are your coworkers aware? Feel free to reach out if you want to talk more 😊

I would get a pin or a little sign to put where people order. In a store in my local mall, one of the employees is Deaf and she put a sign at the register that says she is Deaf on it so the customers can take proper actions to ensure communication is there.

Do they have any back of house/non customer facing roles? I’m not sure where you work but they might be able to help you with accommodations.

I just explain that I don’t hear well. People respond in different ways. Some use gestures along with their speech. That’s the most helpful. Some turn so I can see their face. The ones who yell and speak all exaggerated are unhelpful.

I recommend you get comfortable with expressing it publicly. There's no shame in being HOH!

Buy the pin 📌

I have a shirt that says ""I'm wearing a wire"" with a pic of a hearing aide.  (I have bilateral aides, but can speak, and hear some) It just lets people know in a funny way. I got it on Etsy

I worked in customer service for 8 years worked my way to general manager but when I first started I didn't have hearing aids and didn't know what 85% of them said I had to get a sign that said it was hard of hearing for my register and my manager worked with me even after I got my hearing aids so that we could figure out what worked best with me. I'd say, own it, get a pin, and talk to your manager to see what kind of ADA accommodations work for you so you can succeed",2025-01-31 14:59:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1iegmx6/advice_on_customer_service_as_someone_whos_hoh/
1idorpu,hardofhearing,New to Hearing Loss Resources,"Hi everyone,

My fiance recently lost one eardrum. They may end up needing surgery but either way their hearing will never fully return, and I'm trying to be proactive with finding resources for them to make this transition as smooth as possible. 

If anyone has any advice or resources for people dealing with sudden hearing loss, especially in cases like this (their eardrum ruptured from an infection, something thats happened before but never to this degree and they used to have to have tubes draining them as a kid) it would mean a lot. 

I'm already looking into learning ASL with/for them and have heard good things about Bill Vicars. 

They are in the metro Toronto area so if anyone has resources around there that might be useful too. 

Thank you in advance to anyone willing/able to offer support!

Has your friend been told that they will lose all their hearing in that ear? I had a lot of ear infections as a child, my father was a doctor, and I had a hole in my my left eardrum. I remember I woke up in the middle of the night with a lot of ear pain, got my father. He looked in my ear and said "" Holy Mary Mother of God"". In the end I have bilateral sensorineural hearing loss which runs in the family, for generations, and two of my four siblings also use hearing aids. And, my audiogram shows equal hearing loss in both years. So my eardrum healed.
So until the hearing loss is confirmed, I'm not sure why you're worrying about it at this point.

For what you are looking for you need to connect with tronorto deaf/ hard of hearing resources. (I am not Canadian so I don't know what excate wording you will need to Google upif all that fails, reach out to the nearest deaf school and ask them for responses for adults. They should be able to point you in the right direction.",2025-01-30 14:57:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1idorpu/new_to_hearing_loss_resources/

The solution you're looking for is a bed shaker, a device you put under your pillow or mattress that vibrates when your alarm goes off.

It's really REALLY *alarming* lol. And this is coming from someone who has regularly slept through earthquakes. 

The other thing that worked w/ me, is getting a cheapo smart-watch that has vibration alarms, and just use it for both sleeptracking + silent alarms.

I use a light up alarm clock, life changer!! I used to go to sleep all anxious fearing I'd sleep through my alarm, as I had in the past.

https://a.co/d/eGygUbt

I have a phillips hue light - it's kind of expensive but 1000% worth it because i set the time each night and the light slowly turns on like sunrise. It wakes me up. No noise needed.

I use a watch with a vibration alarm and a ""sunrise"" alarm clock with a very bright light that comes on gradually, over 10 minutes.

The combination has been very effective for me.

I use a vibration alarm clock. It has a little bed shaker you put it in your pillow and then it vibrates instead of making sound

I struggle with this too. There is this app called Shake it Alarm which is super loud but only compatible with android devices.

People have already recommended a bed shaker. But I'm going to also recommend you try a bed shaker. It's a game changer!

My mother (deaf) and father (hoh) used an alarm clock with a built-in light that would flash when it would go off. For accessibility purposes, I'd have to think this can still be bought. 

I started using my smart phone for my alarm. Usually I'll hear it and wake up, but sometimes if I place the phone on the floor to charge, my wife has to nudge me awake. I also run the fan at night, so that makes it even harder. But when I know I have to wake up, I'll place the phone under my pillow. The vibration actually wakes me up before the sound gets going. 

But also, smart phones tend to light up when the alarm goes off. I bet there's an app that lets it flash like mad. Possibly even accessing your phone's flashlight.

When I was working I had a vibrating alarm under my pillow. It worked great! Now that I’m retired my dog wakes me up every day at 4 😂

Not HOH, but my mom is a teacher for the Deaf and she gave me a Sonic Boom alarm clock that shakes my pillow and flashes a light. I’m a reallyyyy heavy sleeper so it’s been a life saver.

Turn on vibration on your phone and sleep with it under your pillow.

I have a wife that kicks me when my alarm sounds for longer than two seconds!  … it works 😂

Thanks everyone for the advice and suggestions! I have ordered some of the gadgets listed so fingers crossed it helps!

This is what I use. Have the same clock since high school. (That's about 15ish years ago). It works. I even had a complaint from my sister that the vibrator goes through the ceiling. I was in a bedroom upstairs and she has a room downstairs. I thought that was hilarious

I use the led light alarm on my iphone, but I have blackout shutters, so the light is really intense. You can also try on of these vibrating bracelets/watches etc

I use my tv as an alarm and it works fantastic

I have to have my phone next to me as it vibrates and flashes and set multiple alarms if my partner isn’t there to kick me awake!!

No one here is qualified to say much medically - but we know you’re not meant to have a hole in your ear drum. Go back and get it checked out.

I bought my otoscope from Amazon for like $30. Without it, my cholesteatoma would never have been discovered. My ENT didn't see it until I showed him my photos from my otoscope.

Your photo appears to show a small perforation of the ear drum. I had one prior to my surgery and it healed on its own. But since you recently had surgery, you need to contact your doctor.

Any loss of taste?

I've only ever worn Phonak hearing aids, Receiver in Canal kind (RIC).  
When I do a sport in which I profusely sweat, the hearing aid can bug out, beep and maybe and turn off (as if it had been damaged). Most of the time if I stick it in a dehumidifier this can be fixed. So yes, moisture is annoying. 

  
Also, the hearing aids can fall off with \*very\* sudden movements. The only time it almost happened to me I was in a roller coaster. I felt like the incoming movement would put my hearing aids in danger and I managed to remove them before they fell off.   
This could also happen for example if you fall while skiing/snowboarding, bungee jumping, etc.

  
So a completely guaranteed waterproof (waterproof even to seawater but I think that's just a dream...) hearing aid that stays put no matter what would be nice.

What’s your relationship to the D/hh community? What research have you already done on the topic?

Wind in the microphone drowning out all other sounds while playing sports. Moisture from sweating get into the hearing aid or on microphone causing intermittent cut off of sound- very aggravating. And like the other person said, a hearing that won’t fly off during high impact sports. I always take my  hearing aid  off before roller coaster rides.",2025-01-28 19:22:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ic9rgg/student_collecting_research_for_a_design_project/
1ic7rtc,hardofhearing,Transcribing glasses,"Hey everyone, I'm hoh and wanted to share my experience with the Even Realities G1b glasses. I just received them yesterday and am trying out the transcribing app. It's not bulletproof but it's pretty helpful. The accuracy and speed is maybe 80-90% accuracy with a 1-2 second delay.

Cons I've noticed so far: 
Wifi/mobile data speed plays a role in transcription times. The Even Realities app logged me out and desynced a few times yesterday. This might be my learning curve though. From what I've read online, the glasses might struggle in the same environments that my hearing aids do. My theory is the mics have the same kind of directionality as my bte hearing aids. I did take the glasses to a mid-noisy restaurant and they performed well 1-1. 

From a tech perspective, I'm hopeful. These are the early days for these glasses and I'm seeing a lot of promise. The company has been responsive to user feedback, and recently became open source so we might see apps from private developers soon.

[댓글]
Is the microphone actually on the glasses? I read that the Hearview glasses relied on the phone's microphone.

Can the transcriptions be set to not log for privacy concerns?

Is there a way to have transcriptions be done locally rather than the ""cloud""?

You won’t get any quality in normal situations. There is too much they can’t handle. Additionally, they need to solve having a microphone close to the speaker to have any chance of picking up sound well.

The problem is not that we don’t hear thing, we hear tons with technology, but that we always are at a disadvantage compared to people with normal hearing. We’re seen as stupid if not interpreting the speech fast enough and reply correctly, and we are seen a unsocial and grumpy if we can’t keep up at social dinners with multiple speakers or at pubs and restaurants. Such glasses solve nothing of that. We will still be seen as inferior, impaired and as someone that people need to adapt to.

I had a disappointing experience with evenrealities. Their glasses really struggle in normal situations. Their mics were designed to point towards your own mouth and not your surroundings. Captions are delayed to the point that it makes conversations awkward unlike Live Transcribe. Not worth the $500-700 I spent on them.

That’s good to hear!  Once these tech companies “get it right” it has the potential to help people have a better quality of life. I’m waiting patiently…..",2025-01-28 18:01:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ic7rtc/transcribing_glasses/

Your best bet is probably getting accommodations for CART

What kind of phone do you have? The latest Android update included transcription ""live transcribe""

Glean is very user friendly and gets like 97 or 98% of words. I work with a disability services office at a college and we use Glean for our Deaf and HoH students. It will record and then turn it into a transcript for you once you’re done.

Have you also tried the roger  devices and table mics which make a huge difference to me in group settings.

Are your classes virtual or in-person? I use the Live Captions feature available on Windows 11 and like it a lot, but I don’t think it would be very effective for in-person classes, unfortunately.

For in-person settings I have had good luck using Otter.ai, which has apps for iOS, Android, and a web app. I would recommend getting an external Bluetooth mic that you can place at a central location. Super nice to have the transcript afterwards too.

For video meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc) I greatly prefer Grain.com for the transcript. I use the live captions in the meeting software but the Grain transcript is synced to the video recording and is very useful for notes.

1iamb6i,hardofhearing,Questions about cost of hearing aids (long post),"Hello, HOH, 

I have a job offer on the table and only a few days to accept or decline, so I am feeling pressed for time. I have mild/moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and my current hearing aids are Phonak Audeo P50 hearing aids. My first and only pair!

My issue: The current hearing aids are now out of warranty, and if I accept this new job, there will be too short of a turnaround time for me to be able to use my current insurance to get a new pair.  The prospective employer's insurance poses a difficult decision. One of the contracts offers a $4k benefit with the option to replace every four years, while the other two contracts replace every three years and cover costs at either 10% or 15%. The first contract seems more generous for hearing aids, but the coverage for my overall medical needs is not as robust as the other two contracts. So I need to consider potentially paying out of pocket.

Vocational rehab in the state (Oregon) mentions that it can help with assistive devices, but I am not finding a lot of details on their website. I think I would need to call or email to get those details, and I may not be able to get that information before my decision is due.

I have only had this one pair of devices, and I had to work the vendor assigned by my insurance, so I am unsure of the general costs for hearing aids. The list price for the same model using that vendor would be $4700 for both devices. Is that about average for hearing aids with a similar quality to the Phonak Audeo P50s?

Has anyone in this community worked with vocational rehab in Oregon? How much of the cost of hearing aids are they able to assist with? 

Any insight would be appreciated. I am still new to using hearing aids and there is a lot to learn.

1iak3y2,hardofhearing,Unknown Cause for Sudden Hearing Loss in Left Ear,"(TL;DR: Has anyone here experienced sudden hearing loss which tests indicated may be due to a neurological issue rather than an inner ear disorder? Any insight into a specific cause?)

Hi everyone, I'm 24M and recently experienced sudden hearing loss in my left ear. I've been to several doctors over the past few months trying to figure out the cause, but none of the tests I've had done have shown proof of any definitive triggers. I was wondering if anyone here has had similar experiences with hearing loss and undergone a VNG and/or MRI during treatment. Did these tests indicate whether your hearing loss was related to an inner ear or neurological issue? To provide some brief context:

In August, I began experiencing pressure in both ears, along with hearing difficulties (particularly in my left ear) and severe vertigo attacks. I consulted an ENT, who suggested Eustachian tube dysfunction, as my CT scan showed no signs of infection. They performed a balloon sinuplasty to reopen the Eustachian tubes, which helped restore normal hearing in my right ear. However, my left ear developed tinnitus about a day after the procedure, and its hearing continued to deteriorate over the next few weeks. At this point, I have an 80dB loss in my left ear while my right ear has returned to normal. After consulting several specialists over the past few months (ENT, audiologist, neurotologist), the only conclusion we’ve been able to make thus far is that my central nervous system is likely involved. I recently underwent an MRI, which was normal and ruled out both acoustic neuroma and labyrinthitis. Additionally, a VNG conducted several months ago indicated that my balance and vertigo issues are not due to an inner ear disorder - such as Meniere's Disease - but instead suggested the presence of ""central vertigo."" My neurotologist referred me to a neurologist as a result, as neurological issues fall outside his expertise. However, he seemed skeptical that a neurologist would find a definitive cause either, leading me to wonder if this could be a poorly understood or unknown condition.

As a side note, I’ve been seeing an upper cervical chiropractor since September. This was recommended online as a potential treatment for Meniere’s, which I initially assumed I had. While the chiropractic treatment has significantly reduced my tinnitus and balance issues, and eventually stopped the vertigo attacks I experienced between August and October, I’m still unsure how that relates to the initial cause of my vertigo and hearing loss.

I would appreciate hearing the perspectives of anyone who has gone through similar experiences. Thank you for reading and for your responses in advance!",2025-01-26 17:14:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1iak3y2/unknown_cause_for_sudden_hearing_loss_in_left_ear/

i started having even more trouble hearing in the ear. i went to see an ENT who examined and cleaned my ears and told me he suspected the trouble hearing was due to me having COVID (i did have COVID at the time i lost my hearing). he said this was temporary hearing loss. he did not find any hearing loss at the time. he gave me steroids to take and advised i see an audiologist if i still can’t hear after the steroids. 

i went to three different audiologists who did hearing tests on me before finding one who could find minor hearing damage. i was told i have damaged ability to process hearing in one ear. she has no clue how that happened. she recommended an OTC hearing aid. i really didn’t like that answer. 

I KNOW i have hearing damage. i have not heard the same since 03/24. i’m constantly needing people to repeat themselves and i’m severely devastated that i’ll never hear music the same. 

i’m at a loss. i don’t know what is going on or what caused it. this almost feels like a medical anomaly. i could spend money i don’t have looking for a new audiologist who might offer a different solution like surgery so i don’t have to wear a hearing aid. 

i’m sorry but i really don’t want to wear a hearing aid. 

i just want to figure out what’s going on and be able to hear again. ",2025-01-23 15:34:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i860o8/nobody_can_tell_me_what_happened/

1i7bgod,hardofhearing,Hard of hearing with Autistic Spectrum Disorder?,"Hello there, I'm hard of hearing being on the autistic spectrum. I noticed some people with hearing aids also are in the autistic spectrum. Is it common? I feel like due to ""hypersensitivity"" their hearing is less good, hence hearing loss.

[댓글]
It's not very common. I know dozens on the spectrum and not one has hearing issues. It's kinda lonely...being autistic and hard of hearing. Sorry people are mean to you and don't treat you right and just want to always hate on you.

I'm also HoH/AuDHD! It's tough sometimes, my hearing aids can be pretty overstimulating but I need them. Hope you're doing well!

I am hard of hearing and am autistic. It's suspected that the cause of the hearing issues are ehlers danlos syndrome. I was diagnosed end of last year.

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD which professionals are saying will probably be recategorized as part of the autism spectrum in future Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). DSM-5-TR is the latest version which was published in 2022. https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm

ADHD can bring RSD, rejection sensitivity, and a myriad of other comorbid conditions that are related to ADHD from restless leg syndrome, to sleep apnea. 

https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24099-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-rsd

https://www.additudemag.com/when-its-not-just-adhd/

So yea, it’s annoying. It’s lonely. But you’re not alone. The group is small but it’s there. Deaf/HH, ADHD/Autism/Audhd, potential audio processing disorder. Lucky us!  Good luck!

I'm diagnosed with ASD and also have severe-profound hearing loss and hearing aids. It's an interesting combo lol

While I'm not autistic I do have ADHD and while I still have hearing loss I feel like part of my hearing loss is due to audio processing disorder. I know when I take my ADHD meds I have a much easier time understanding words and conversations.

I am AuDHD with congenital, moderate hearing loss (it is both conductive and sensorineural with vestibular migraines associated and my ENT can’t find out why unless I do exploratory surgery of my middle ear) but I do also experience hypersensitivity to sound and sensory processing delays for what it’s worth. 

I have hearing aids in both ears.
I couldn’t say whether it is common or not but maybe it is haha. I discovered my hearing loss before it was discovered I had AuDHD.

HoH and autistic here 👋
I also struggle with noise sensitivity and hyperacusis so i am opting for a BAHA instead of surgery to treat my conductive loss (max in right ear), as i would like to retain the ability to turn the world down.

I am Autistic and i have hearing impairments and have been told that hearing aids are going to be needed in the future.My hearing loss was caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction one tube has a deformity but both my ears have ETD and ear infections that were not treated including one caused by allmost drowning in 2007

I have one set of genetics dictating hearing loss (from mom) and my family also has individuals with autism or ADHD, those outside this branch didn't get the hearing loss. So i can't say it's directly related based on my family. More like who got what genetic disposition. I have both...

Disliking noisy environments is something that can be a thing for people who are hard of hearing and/or on the spectrum, but it doesn’t mean you’re autistic. I tried to explain to my psych who misdiagnosed me with autism. He was right jerk. I’m pretty sure I have ADHD though.

I’m AuDHD and hard of hearing. I’ve also likely got audio processing disorder - but because of my specific hearing loss and ADHD trying to figure that out is nearly impossible. I don’t wear hearing aids I just have a significant loss of tone range aka I have what I like to call old lady hearing.

I'm hard of hearing and fall into the spectrum with ADHD mixed in. I've learned how to read lips but is incredibly hard to maintain the attention span and awkwardness of staring at peoples mouth when they speak.

Yes... I have lots of trouble hearing what people are saying when there's background noise, and I need to watch TV with subtitles. I thought I needed a hearing aid. (On the flipside I have great hearing when I'm trying to fall asleep, go figure). Then I discovered that both those things are related to autism, and there's nothing wrong with my ears at all. I did a deep dive into the research and talk about it here: [https://strangeclarity.substack.com/p/why-autism-gave-me-supersonic-hearing](https://strangeclarity.substack.com/p/why-autism-gave-me-supersonic-hearing)

Hi! I know this is kind of old but my son is 2.5 yrs old and has both. I came here to actually look for any insights about the combo. He hasn't been able to develop speech because of these 2 things and I'm not sure what to do other than implement sign language, which I'm not sure catch on to but I'm hoping.

Were you diagnosed at a young age? If so what was that experience like? I want my son to have a childhood where he feels his needs are met but we are on waitlisting for treatments so it's hard moving forward without supports.

I was recently diagnosed as autistic and have also found out that I am hard-of-hearing in my right ear (high-pitched noises are fine, lows and mids are not), so I'm about to get some sort of hearing aid. I am a bit worried that they will make sensory overwhelm happen more quickly, but I also want to improve my understanding of conversations in larger work meetings. The high pitches being intact means that I can hear bird deterrent equipment when nobody else can.",2025-01-22 13:47:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i7bgod/hard_of_hearing_with_autistic_spectrum_disorder/
1i6jpph,hardofhearing,How do I hear my professor? ,"I’m in an ASL class and my professor makes us sit in a U-shape so that we can see each other signing. That means I have to be far away from her and I cannot hear her. I cannot afford HAs. What are some ways that I can hear the professor speak.

My hearing loss is Mild-Moderate reverse slope. I’m having so much fatigue after just an hour.

[댓글]
Sorry, it's an ASL class? What is she speaking that she can't be signing? As time goes on hopefully she'll sign more and speak less. 
Is there a seat in the ushape that's closer to her? If so, you should ask to move seats. While also letting her know of your disability and how you're feeling. She may be able to offer additional accommodations that you're not aware of. Off the top of my head, she could speak louder, speak looking at you, talk less and sign more.

Is this beginning sign language?

If not, that's definitely not full immersion language education if she's still speaking while teaching.

Try to find a seat near a corner where the sound rebounds back to you, some HoH finds that useful.

Do you have one working hearing or both?

Does your school do accommodations? 

I've have to use a FM unit where the teacher has a mike and it's broadcasted to the listener and the neckloop sends the signal to the hearing aid. 

Be sure to have an audiogram and a doctor's note to prove to accomodations office for the need of it.

I have one working ear and if I was desperate to hear the lecture, no joke, I've put the arm behind the ear and the hand to the back of the back like I'm scratching the back, the arm provides a backboard for the sound to rebound to the hearing aid. kinda like cupping the ear to hear better.

Ask to be moved closer. Those who can hear will sit in the back. This is what my ASL teacher did. She's a CODA(HoH herself) and was the one to give me my sign name as a native speaker of ASL.

Your teacher shouldn’t be speaking, to be honest with you

Depending on where you are, there are some places that are willing to pay hearing aids for you and can assist you with your disability. I highly recommend that you see if there are any Vocational Rehabilitation services near you and if they’re available. The ones I know about are in the U.S. so if you live there, it would be a good idea to check it out https://rsa.ed.gov/about/states

I bought some 50 dollar hearing aids off amazon. they're not like super amazing but they get the job done. try looking on Amazon for some cheap aids.

Is she micced up? That would probably be the easiest accommodation and should be readily available. Ask her to mic up.

I also have mild moderate reverse slope hearing loss   The best hearing aids for this type is Widex.  Can you call the company and explain your situation, perhaps they have an old demo pair that they can give to you? Tell them that you are a young student.   My heart goes out to you.

I've had two surgeries done on my ears before. One in 2010 when I was 12. That was my right ear. And one in 2018 that was my left.

go to the doctor

I'm not saying it couldn't be a tumor, because it could, but I will say that that kind of tumor is very rare. Some more common causes of losing hearing on one side are severe ear infection, wax buildup, sudden permanent hearing loss due to viral infection in auditory/hearing nerve, and head trauma. I'm sure there are more things that could cause it, but those are the ones that come to mind for me as someone who studies audiology. I think it would be smart to go to an ENT/audiology joint practice and get checked out to figure out what's going on and what could be done to help you hear better. Good luck 🤞🏼

Get a professional cleaning at an ENT or audiologists office. My hearing loss gets significantly worse when I need a good professional ear cleaning because my earwax tends to compact itself in my ears and it wouldn’t come out. I have a coworker with 0 hearing loss that would go in for a professional cleaning every year and a half or so when he began to struggle to hear his wife, getting a doc to clean his ears resolved everything until it was time to come again.

I’m hard of hearing as well and I am a vocalist. When I first started learning how to use instruments, I started with the trumpet, but one of the reasons why I stopped playing it was because I couldn’t hear the higher notes. Afterwards, I switched to drums and absolutely loved it! It’s amazing to not worry about tone and just go on rhythm. The only reason why I am not a drummer at the moment is because I have broken my wrist, but I still love the instrument. I have been a vocalist previously in bands and through the music group I work through, I was able to switch to vocals for my band (which I also love to do).

I’ve always had this weird ability where I can match pitch really well, even when its really high and deep (where my registry loss are). It’s a struggle for me because I can’t hear where I am doing it wrong, but the people around me correct me or reaffirm me when I am doing it right, which helps a lot. Another thing I’d suggest (though I’ve never played guitar) is learn the fingering on your songs and go off of physical movement instead of just listening to it. Watch your other band mates and see what they do and try and copy them to help yourself.

Well I feel weird while playing and not knowing how right I am doing it, if you have confidence and do something to the best of your ability, the crowd will never notice. I do have to say, it sucks that others do not understand what we go through, but never let your frustration stop you, strive to always improve on your music, and do not be afraid to ask others if you are doing something wrong. I hope this helps you! 😃

I was born hard of hearing. F57. I just bought a guitar for Christmas. I have a hard time with lower pitches. My low e string never sounds right to me. Thank God for clip on tuners. I am out of practice with singing. However, I wanted to learn guitar since I was a kid so here I am. 

After I tune up with the tuner I play each string, I am trying to train my ears.

Part of why I stopped singing chorally was my CAPD was making it way too difficult to understand the difference in tone and be able to pick out the right tone to try to follow from a crowd. I gave it a good couple of years but the difficulty was just not worth the amount of effort and amount of faking I was having to do. I miss it though. 

I have hearing aids now to help me with words and being able to differentiate sounds a bit more from each other, but I don't know if it could really do enough to help me with musicality.... might test it sometime.

What kind of hearing loss do you have?

I have Mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss in my [bad] right ear and sensorineural hearing loss in my left ear. 

Bone conduction headsets (like [Shokz](https://shokz.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAhreNBhAYEiwAFGGKPFZCwH4PnBqOSW22rzwVOzlsmgWSUy0g2osDUXgU5iwgdCgD2KjrxxoCXXoQAvD_BwE) -- I currently use [this style](https://shokz.com/pages/openrun)) may be of interest to you. I enjoy listening to music with mine and can clearly hear lyrics without having to crank up the volume like I do in a stereo setting in my car. 

My dad is a musician and has experienced hearing loss over recent years. He primarily plays acoustic guitar. He has commented on how it's neat that you can feel the sound wave vibrations. 

I have only toyed with a guitar (keyboard and drums) here and there. I was finally able to experience what he was talking about when my family and I went out to a live orchestral performance a few years ago. Because of the layout of the orchestral hall, I didn't miss a sound. It was awesome and I truly look forward to going again, as does my dad. 

If you play acoustic, maybe you could transition to an electric style so that you can increase the volume of your instrument with an amp? With how tech is these days, a small one may do the job or you could hook up an aux port adapter and attach a Bluetooth dongle to it to then use a bone conduction headset? 

I'm sorry that your fellow musicians don't understand what you're going through. That can make the hearing loss feel like a defect instead of a fact. I'd speak to a therapist about it if you start to feel more than bummed out by it. My therapist has helped me, at least.

Playing an instrument and struggling to hear it's what brought me here! I played guitar in a band and could never find ear plugs that didn't completely ruin the tone of my amp, cutting all high frequencies. So I opted not to wear plugs. Now I'm HOH with a good amount of tinnitus in my right ear. 

I don't have any suggestions, but would like to offer this advice: protect what you have so you don't suffer any additional loss due to carelessness

No, but Im new to the HoH world, and I'm a singer. I can read music, but prefer learning a song ""by ear"". It's super-frustrating to not be able to hear the piece correctly to learn it correctly.

1i4y0a8,hardofhearing,Term and/or ASL sign for communication difference?,"I know it's a contested subject on whether auditory processing disorder counts as HoH.  I'm wondering if there's a move to form a separate term for communication differences?

I have APD (fluctuates in severity) and situational mutism from being autistic.  I'm in the process of learning ASL and frequently use AAC to communicate, need subtitles, caption phone calls etc.  HoH loosely works but doesn't often explain what's actually happening, especially in situations when I'm using AAC/ASL for mutism and not just hearing.  I use HoH for simplicity in general but avoid claiming that when interacting with the d/Deaf community.  

It seems like a separate enough experience, and common enough, that it needs it's own term.  Does this already exist?  Not looking to pick a fight, I'm genuinely curious and looking for information and ideas

Don’t know asl but I have slight experience with bsl and I assume that the signer would fingerspell “APD”.

I am hoh andi see no problem. It's not anyone business to know what exactly is going on. You have the right to say hoh or Austim or apd or just say that your disability is not up for discussion.

[댓글]
If the loss impacts your inner ear, it will mess with your balance.

I couldn’t pass a DUI test sober. Stand in one leg lol

Not because of hearing loss but I have dysprxia which impacts coordination and spatial awareness etc

I have garbage balance. Friends have absolutely hilarious stories of me wiping out.

A common symptom of sensorineural hearing loss is balance/coordination issues. I have really bad balance, coordination, and spatial awareness. I can’t sense which way is up or down too, which has led to some scary situations while swimming underwater.

Bad balance, poor proprioception, no audio spatial awareness, audio processing disorder — I am not sure if they are all attributable to hearing loss or having my hearing loss untreated as a child.

I definitely get vertigo that I didn’t get before my hearing loss

Same here, not sure if it's my hearing loss or not, but can definitely relate.

Omg, I was so clumsy as a child. I’m walking down the hallway and next thing you know my head is swiping the wall. 
Also, my hearing loss is due to a brain hemorrhage at birth so I have no sense of space and I can’t imagine things in my head and translate it into something. Think drawing, sculpting, painting, etc. 
although I do crochet and am learning knitting.

Depending on your hearing loss, you may end up liking certain parts of a particular song because that's what you *can* hear and It'll seem like odd tastes to normal hearing.

""*this* song you like but not this one??""

bad spatial awareness (bumping into things), bad balance, difficulty juggling tasks when trying to understand. 

I literally have to put everything down and pay attention to understand, hence no conversation during driving - that includes sign language.

I gesture with my conversation to ensure I understand and they understand, including not using sign language.

I read body language more than understanding words, I tend to pay attention more when it seems urgent or angry.

I have sensorineural hearing loss but doesn’t affect my balance or spatial awareness. I am pretty good at swimming and can drive good.

I do inner ear rehab exercises every day.  If I don't I start banging onto walls frequently.

Anyone else get really sick flying on an airplane? The rest of my family is fine.

Car sickness too -- depending on the car design and how the driver maneuvers.

I had a severe brain injury about a year ago. It caused serious hearing loss and major balance issues. I still have both, over 1 year later…

These are pretty common, so not weird, but my HoH has come with very bad recruitment, hyperacusis, and misophonia.

In my family, everyone who has hearing loss also has an essential tremor.  My theory is that both have something to do with crappy nerves.

I had tried chemical sprays from pest control companies and they didn't work. After many failed attempts I tried a comapny called ThermoPest Bed Bug Heat Treatments and there heat treatment worked first time and they also offered a 60 day warranty.",2025-01-16 21:40:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i304wa/does_anyone_get_weird_side_effects_for_being_hard/

[댓글]
I’m hard of hearing and don’t know ASL. So maybe ask, but the effort will be greatly appreciated.

What’s important for me is making sure I’m able to see your face when you’re speaking - I’m reading lips and adding context. With that I will converse in a way that most people don’t even notice.

However, if someone starts speaking and I start to pay attention 1/2 way through a sentence, I might end up lost and ask you to repeat.

And if you watch TV or a film together, suggest closed captioning, so it’s not embarrassing to ask.

Bonne chance!

Be mindful of the audio environment you're in.  Prob not going to have a meaningful conversation in the subway.

First, ask him what he needs/wants. Even though most of us in this subreddit share a common denominator, there is a variation of what a person needs or wants as hearing loss is a spectrum.

He may likes to be in quiet places or if he reads lips, make sure you look at him (talking in another room or behind him is a big no no) while you’re talking. If he didn’t understand you or someone around him, repeat what you/they said (please don’t say “never mind” or “ I’ll tell you later”). Write it down or say it in different words in case he still doesn’t understand. Don’t talk with your mouth full of course and no hands covering up your mouth. He may or may not have other accessibility needs but these are the main ones if he speaks only

Try to meet somewhere without a lot of background noise.

Here’s what I can say: hearing aids are not like glasses. They don’t restore normal hearing, instead they just make (some) sounds louder, which often include some things like background noise. Be patient, speak a little more slowly, distinctly and loudly than you may be accustomed to normally. Be attentive to the body language of the guy as you speak to tell whether he is having trouble hearing you or not. He may not indicate that he’s having difficulty. Be aware that he may guess what you were saying rather than ask you to repeat something, so if there are odd non sequiturs, this may be why.

HOH is such a spectrum that it’s tough to answer.

I’ve got moderate lose in both ears (bordering on severe), but I use hearing aids.  As long as I can see your face I can hear you, but there’s no need for you to learn ASL since I don’t know it either.

I am HOH my recommendation is speak directly to the person so they can lip read. Don’t cover your mouth while talking or if they don’t hear don’t say things like never mind when they ask for you to repeat it. Always tap them on the shoulder nicely, if they are facing behind you and face them directly if you’re trying to get their attention. Everyone is different when it comes to their hearing, I don’t use sign language but it’s great your learning if he does use it. Good luck!

You need to ask him how he likes to communicate. Other more general obvious advice is don’t go somewhere too crowded/loud and make sure you face him when you talk.

Do your best to not get frustrated when he needs you to repeat things

Everyone is different. I think your best bet is asking him. We don’t know his exact impairment and what he struggles with. Beyond that I think just being willing to repeat yourself or speak louder if needed (try not to yell though, ik from personal experience that it sucks). Keep in mind he might not know ASL, I don’t even though I’m also HOH (although it’s never bad to know ASL anyways). Maybe you could make learning ASL a couples activity? I also think that you should ask for his specific impairment and try to learn about it. It’s always nice when someone near you understands what it is you struggle with.

I'm hard of hearing and fluent in ASL.
 1) give him an extra beat or two to respond to you that patience is so beautiful when 99% of the world won't give it to you. 
2) don't speak slowly between words unless they ask you to. Just space between paragraphs. 
3) Accept that some goofy conclusions will be drawn by words they swore they heard right but ended up wrong. My favorite example personally is I only hear the stressed syllables of words when it gets bad. Boss said ""Eh oh ish as"" so I played Madgab™ in my head heyo sayo mayo play though etc. What brain heard ""Hey yo bitch ass."" What he actually said to me ""Hey, do dishes."" It's gonna get close and right 80% of the time but that, 20% is a fucking trip. (percentage varries by person)
4) Don't highlight the disability. Ask what you can do to make it better if you notice a flinch or in the texting after the date (been there done that a lot). Don't lead with ""so I hear you're deaf"". 
5) Just love them, give them the understanding, grace, and patience that's clearly pouring from you if you're asking this sub this question. You are already 85% better than the rest of the world because you asked this. After a shitty week of work with ""of course we don't do it that way, you've been slipping a lot"" coming out of my boss' mouth when I asked if I heard _____ right? You've literally made me tear up between past trauma and reliving when my husband found me angry and messy in my disabilities and showed the compassion and grace you are expressing. By no means does this mean y'all are compatible but God you're making this old woman smile at fond memories (I'm only 30 but been with husband since a month before graduation).

I agree with the other comments so far. 

I'd like to add that open body language is welcoming.  Being direct with what you say is great too. I personally like to be asked before someone initiates physical contact unless I can read your body language. Since you're romantically interested, this may come naturally.

As the others have mentioned, reading lips is beneficial (but not everyone has the practice jsyk) as is ASL. I hope they want to learn with you, as that is what I would love with a future partner. C: I began my ASL journey last year.

Best of luck, OP!

A lot of great advice here already. But I will add: if he lipreads, you might feel self conscious because you're not used to having someone stare at your mouth. Please don't put your hand over your mouth or block it with a napkin. It's soooooo obnoxious when people do this. Think of it like listening to an audiobook and it suddenly shuts off mid-sentence and restarts three paragraphs later. It's so frustrating!!! 

Also, try not to turn away when talking if he's lipreading. People do it without realizing they're doing it and it's so frustrating. And they don't mean to, so I look like the jerk if I get frustrated by it.

A quiet place with no loud background noises.

When in eviorment with a lot of people around you and some loud music such as crowded cafes are just no for me to hang out. People tought i was ignoring them in cafe while i actually couldnt understand a thing they said.

If u gotta wispher something to him, it would be better if u wrote it in ur phone and showed it to him 

A lot of people hard of hearing can read lips (not everybody but the majority i talked with we communicated by reading lips hahahha)

Speak a bit loudly and clearly and u will be fine, u can always ask him and i belive he will say it.

Willingness to understand their experience goes a long way in a relationship. I appreciate you seeking out information about this. 

Ask them if they are willing to share more about their hearing impairment if they haven’t gone into it already, and then ask what is helpful for them when someone is communicating. As others have said, it varies by individual and type of impairment. And not everyone learns ASL, especially if they still have some hearing. 

Remember, despite doing everything he needs, and even if he’s wearing hearing aids, he will not hear everything. And that’s ok! That doesn’t mean he’s not trying. Please be patient. HoH individuals can be very sensitive to other’s frustrations and it can be internalized as shame.

I think most hard of hearing people (myself included) don’t know ASL. But the fact that you care, and want to do things that make communication easier, is a huge plus!  Thanks for being thoughtful and considerate. 

For me, I would say just speak slowly and clearly. Don’t mumble. Try to enunciate carefully. And ask him about the volume of your voice. Sometimes louder is NOT better.   


If he wears hearing aids then ask him how your voice levels are. In a bar or restaurant the background noise is so difficult for me, even with my hearing aids in.

There are lots of free videos on YouTube with asl sign, and I think there are apps that have asl sign language

as a parent of a hoh child, i hope he encounters someone as considerate and sweet as you. Its a wide spectrum that hard of hearing falls under. For example my son has profound hear loss in his left and severe in his right. Knowing where his hearing is at is going to help. Lesser background noise is generally an easier situation. You making and showing these efforts before even meeting says alot. Bless you.

I’d say try and talk normally, maybe comment on the place or area, ask how his day has been, did he work or study today, etc… the level of sound / clarity will be noted by him and he can advise (and yes, I know it is too late, it is mainly for others with the same question). I doubt he can sign, but it is a bloody difficult way to communicate anyway. Try and have an app on your phone where you can type stuff in and it is clear, *plus have a small notepad (sticky notes are fine, just put a used one in your pocket)* and try to save space.. often it is just one or two words we miss: if he asks what you like and you say chocolate, don’t write ‘I like chocolate’, just write ‘chocolate’ (that particular word may not be a problem, but you get it). Try and be quick, don’t drag it out. Don’t ask a whole heap of questions if it is noisy.

We struggle with specifics, such as names, be they people or places. Hence, he may not ask the questions you are used to being asked. We can’t decipher off clues at all, with specifics.

Be blunt and to the point, don’t waffle or go off on tangents. Please do not go into big long spiels. As rushbc said, don’t mumble. Also don’t make jokes early, or try and temper that - it can work once you’re familiar. He needs to get used to your voice. As for noise levels, rubbing out a bar or restaurant makes things difficult to set up a date! It can help if it is quieter, but if noisy, have your writing tools (it really matters) ready. The cinema is not for a first date - way too awkward (for anyone, not talking about hoh) but a good idea is to meet somewhere and then go to the venue. A shopping mall, if it is too noisy, maybe go outside, but there should be plenty of sections where it is quiet enough.",2025-01-16 14:48:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i2qj5j/going_on_a_date_with_someone_whos_hard_of_hearing/
1i2mus1,hardofhearing,HoH in the Workplace ,"What's your current occupation? 

Is i comfortable for someone who is HoH?

I work in Nutrition in and elementary school setting. The environment is loud and requires a lot of focus to listen 50% of the day. I'm looking for a different job that isn't so taxing and pays a bit better. Going back to college is part of the plan. 

Jobs I'm interested in:

Vet Med

Rad Tech

Auto Mechanic 

Anyone have exp in these fields as a HoH person?

TIA~

As a graduate from the YouTube Automotive Mechanic School, I don’t think there are any issues being HoH as a mechanic. I take my HAs out and wear earplugs if I’m using any power tool bigger than a cordless ratchet. In a place like a tire shop with air tools running nonstop, I’d wear earplugs all day.

I’m a server at a sports bar 🫠 AND I suck at reading lips hahaha so basically it’s me screaming “WHAT?” &amp; telling people I’m HOH 😂

I take care of monkeys at a sanctuary. I have moderate cookie bite hearing loss that is progressing. I don't have any major issues even though similar to the careers you are interested in being able to hear is extremely important. I wear hearing aids and that helps a lot but i can also do it without hearing aids, i just wouldnt do anything kind of dangerous without them like go inside an enclosure with a monkey. I would also ask a specific coworkers who is working in a nearby area to come and physically get me if there is an emergency. The only thing that is a pain is having to be really careful about water. 

I have some communication issues sometimes with coworkers, but they know I am hard of hearing and so do my managers, so we usually work it out quickly. I repeat things back if it's important to make sure I understood correctly. They also will use gestures if I'm not getting something or mime an activity. I think I actually do weirdly well in certain situations that are loud and chaotic because I am already used to not being able to hear lol, so I'm really good at lip reading and using gestures.

in Elementary - 

Think about teaching HoH students.

I always get let go do to my hearing :/ I’m not sure what my next move is but I’m tired of people not understanding what HOH is.",2025-01-16 11:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i2mus1/hoh_in_the_workplace/
1i2ablv,hardofhearing,Roger On,"I may be getting a new device. It’s called Roger On, by Phonak. I currently use Phonak hearing aids. 

I’ve never heard of Roger on before today. 
It’s supposed to be some sort of external microphone for hearing aids. I’ve never seen one or used one. 

Does anyone have experience with this device? I’d like your input and feedback please. 

[댓글]
Yes, I have one. The Bluetooth connection is good. It definitely helps me when I am in a crowded area where I am trying to hear a conversation, like a restaurant. I have also used it at conferences and meetings (I can put it on a table and point it at the speaker or place it near him or her if I need to. Another time it was extremely helpful was on a tour when the guide clipped it to her shirt. It allowed me to hear everything she was saying without having to be in the front the entire time (we were walking around to different areas and rooms) and it has decent distance range so I was able to explore and still hear her talking.

I have the Roger On. 

Best use is for hearing a single speaker in a noisy environment:

* My wife wears it when we go out to eat
* I've given it to public speakers at events to wear - trivia nights, weddings, etc
* Running a big game of Blood on the Clocktower (a werewolf-like party game), I'd use it to hear individuals in the noisy room.

For ""area"" mode, like putting it on a table at a restaurant so you can hear everyone, it's good but not great - it tends to amplify everything to the same level, so there's *less* background noise, but what background noise there is is louder. Definitely recommend elevating it - I usually ask for an empty glass I flip over and put it on.

The ""shotgun mic"" mode can be nice too, though it can also be eyebrow raising - I once used it at a funeral to hear the person giving the eulogy, pointing it at him from my seat, and as a result had a slightly awkward conversation after the fact (I should've given him a heads up beforehand haha, he thought it was recording him).

I've used a Roger pen, an older version of this concept. That was a microphone the size of a marker (or a large pen) that a speaker could hold like a microphone or clip to their lapel.

It was very useful in loud environments, but you had to be extremely assertive to get people to use the pen and then get it back from them.

It looks like this Roger On device is like a small shotgun mic that you can sit on a table or hold yourself, pointed at the speaker? That seems like it would be more practical, but I haven't tried the new version.

Have any of the YouTube channels that review hearing devices, like Dr Cliff, reviewed the Roger On?

Just to clarify, I’m asking about ANY device similar to “Roger on”. It can be any brand or any company.

My sons teacher uses one in the classroom. He says it helps him hear her much better.

I have a meeting with HR tomorrow - I have a mini Roger for work, but I bought myself a Roger for hiking, car rides and restaurants. 

I don't want to use my personal Roger at work - 

They think that If I use the app on my personal phone, the roger will help me hear better. 

I love my Roger for hiking - I can hear others and participate in conversations!

Remote microphones work really well to improve speech understanding in noise by boosting the speech to noise ratio.   ClearCast makes a device you wear around your neck that has a remote microphone.

Anyone else??

I have an external microphone for my oticon, similar device different brand. I like it. Let me know if you want to know more or just wanted info specifically about the Roger.

So the idea of the Roger on is to filter out the background noise and stream the speaker right into the hearing aid. As you can imagine it's a hit and miss thing. I find in some situations it's a lifesaver, in other I just look like a dill asking people to point their words at the mic! 🤣🤣

I figured for what I need it for it's worth it. In restaurants it's amazing

I love my Roger On! I use it almost daily. I plug into my computer for better streaming and clarity when doing online meetings. I also use it in the car. Make sure you to turn off all ambient/surround noise in the hearing aid app when using it in a car. Also, I've used it for dinner events and in large noisy settings. I would recommend everyone have a companion remote mic. It's so worth it.

It's awesome. I use it all the time

I have Phonak Lumity HAs and a Roger On.

I think it's great but for one issue. In really noisy environments, I've learnt that using the MyPhonak app to mute my HAs so that the only audio I'm picking up is through the Roger On works brilliantly.

The annoying thing for me is that once I do this and put my phone away or close the app, the HAs don't stay muted.

I'd say this issue (until I find a solution) is reducing my enjoyment of it from 100% to probably 75%

If you have an iPhone you can go into settings/accessibility and under the hearing section (?) you can turn on Live captions and it will let you get captions through the microphone (like
For real life conversations) or from
Your iPhone (like if you’re watching videos on your phone). I started using it in meetings last month and like it I

I have an iPhone. I use the “Live Captions” feature…well I try to use it. It doesn’t seem to work very well. 

For phone calls, I use an app called INNOCAPTION. it’s great. It works so much better and it’s FREE! 
****But InnoCaption is only for phone calls****
 
I’m hoping Apple makes live captions better so I can use it for off-the-phone conversations.

These caption apps are kind of like our hearing. If it's a noisy setting or the person doesn't articulate, it has a hard time translating. It can be quite funny sometimes. It's good to show people whether or not they speak well. It kind of validates us. If ASR (automatic speech recognition) is getting them wrong, it's not just us. People do not speak well.

I have used the iPhone ASR and the Samsung. Samsung is faster. Sometimes I have to wait for iPhone's to get going. Built in accessibility in smartphones is nice.

I use Live Transcribe on Android, it helps but as soon as it's noisy...forget it",2025-01-15 19:55:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i2660x/voice_to_text_app/
1i1yjyv,hardofhearing,"Sometimes, people have to repeat what they say to me twice because it sounds mumbled to me","For context, I'm in my late twenties and I have had this experience for almost a decade if I remember correctly.

When I'm talking face to face with people, they have to repeat what they say twice because I couldn't understand it. Others hear it clearly but I only hear mumbled sounds and sometimes, I hear a different word that they didn't even say.

When I'm working on my computer (talking to international clients and such via headphones), I can hear them clearly (even if not in the max volume)

Before, I used to listen to music using an earphones but recently, I'm using shokz open ear headphones which is definitely better since my ear canals get oily when I use the earphones for a long time.

Also, I occasionally hear ringing sounds in one of my ears.

I'm trying to find an audiologist near me here in the Philippines so that they can tell me what's wrong with me.

Definitely see an audiologist. This can be hearing loss, something your ear canal, or maybe even a brain disorder. I have Central auditory processing disorder and it takes specialized diagnostic procedures to diagnose, so you may have to find a really big Clinic if they can't find hearing loss and it's still happening.

I hope you find an audiologist or ENT. It might be APD (auditory processing disorder)

There are forms of hearing loss that develop later in life. I have middle frequency hearing loss, commonly called cookie bite for the shape of the audiogram, that started in my twenties. I was in hearing aids by my mid thirties.

It could be auditory processing or another type of loss, but the point is, you're not ""too young"" for hearing loss. Definitely get tested. I also hear better with a headset even without hearing aids. 

Good luck!

How severe is her hearing loss? And what remedies (hearing aids?) are in place already?

1. Kids are never too young to have captions on the tv. Even if she’s not actively reading, think of it as accessible preliteracy exposure
2. Ensure access to DHH peers. Does she have any DHH classmates? Do you live in an area with any DHH playgroups?
3. Ensure access to DHh role models. There’s a common trope of DHh kids assuming deafness is fatal since they never meet any DHh adults. Do you live in an area with Deaf meet ups and community events?
4. Be accessible with spoken communication. Even if the loss is mild moderate, follow best practices for access like facing her when speaking. Do not call to her from another room… I’m still trying to get my parents to unlearn this one at age 30!
5. As she gets older, consider using accessible therapy to help her navigate life in the in between of the deaf and hearing worlds. Certain diagnoses, including anxiety (especially social anxiety), depression, and substance abuse disorders are more common in DHh populations. This is not necessarily innate but rather reflects difficulties of coping with a society that is often inaccessible, and at times cruel, to DHh people. Starting therapy preventatively could ensure your daughter has access to DHh guidance on self advocacy, coping, and navigating life more generally. National Deaf Therapy is a great resource, and I believe they accept child clients
6.  Celebrate her culture, and do not be afraid to draw attention to cultural differences! Kids exposed to both hearing and Deaf culture may need guidance on how to navigate cultural differences. Talk about best practices for communicating with hearing people vs. communicating with DHh people. Kids may not initially understand when to say “excuse me” rather than tap someone on the shoulder, for example. Draw attention to cultural differences and highlight that one culture is not better than the other, they are simply different.
7. Do not just sign to her — prompt her to sign for herself as well. While we should avoid policing how DHH kids communicate by forcing non-preferred communications, kids will likely prefer to communicate in a manner that is most comfortable. If she prefers to speak over sign, that is okay! — but signing is like a “muscle” you should encourage her to build over time. If you have goals of bilingualism, signing to her will only boost her receptive understanding… encouraging her to sign as well will boost her expressive language

Open to any questions you have!

I have two young kiddos 6yo and 4yo with hearing loss (using hearing aids) and one fun thing we have done is let them pick ear mold colors. 

Fun fact if you look on Etsy and some other places you can find hearing aids charms that sit on the tubing of the aids. My girls have enjoyed their special ""earrings"".

Hello!

I’ve been hard of hearing almost my whole life from a young age. Here are some tips for you that hopefully should help you:

-She may not just hear some things in general, in my case I can’t hear my water machine, humming bird chirps (or at least not very well), or bees.

-If you guys decide on getting her hearing aids, she may or may not want to wear them all the time or not at all because they do become pretty uncomfortable after a while. It is important to understand that hearing aids shouldn’t be seen as just making people’s voices louder, but everything else loud. 

-In that case, with or without the hearing aids, try to talk with them in a quiet environment and when out in public for food, try to find quiet or mildly noisy places.

-Make sure when talking with them, you have their attention and they can see your mouth.

-Try and be patient if they ask you to repeat what you said.

-They will mishear the weirdest things and even they won’t know how they heard that.

-Captions on TV are magical and are amazing! This makes it so much easier to watch them for me. It’s kind of funny because I’ll watch shows or movies I’ve seen for years, but I never had the captions on and so I’ll find out that a line wasn’t what I thought it was! XD

I can tell by this post you want to do everything you can to help your kid, it did not come off and a bad way. In fact, I say it’s amazing of you to reach out and ask us to help your kid! 😃

Forgive me, I don't have a copy on my phone. I can share it later this week. 

My daughter can have conversations, she just doesn't have the best back and forth yet. We call it (her name)'s time, when people ask how to tell what she said, us, the parents and a good handful of people who are around her a lot can translate her adorable rambling 💕

Thank you for your time.

This may be a strange question ... but what country are you in ? 

The only reason I ask is some areas there are summer / weekend camps for kids who are deaf or hard of hearing. if you live in a remote area like i do that doesnt have a deaf community often kids will feel singled out / different (they may not act it but the thought is there) because of their hearing loss ... IF its possible financially / physically getting a chance to interact with other kids who are Deaf / hard of hearing can sometimes help to tear down that though of okay i am different. Also chance to meet other parents with kids in same situation. 

Ontario Canada i know for example has Bob Rumball Foundation that actually runs a summer camp for not only kids who are D/HOH but also adults who are D/HOH and for people learning ASL :) you may have something similar in your area",2025-01-15 04:42:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i1psb2/daughter_is_hoh_4yo_any_tips_or_recommendations/

1i1la7r,hardofhearing,Portable Ultra-Compact Wireless Microphones For Voice To Text Purposes,"I'm researching portable ultra-compact wireless microphones for voice to text purposes. For context, I am hard of hearing. The most recent microphone I liked Hey Mic is discontinued. I'm doing some research into what's available now in the consumer/prosumer space. I would prefer a microphone that can directly connect to the phone rather than use a dongle. On the other hand I am open to dealing with a USB C dongle for better connectivity/range, quality audio or other benefits.

I am coming across new products that have 2 or 4 channels (one mono mic for each channel) which is exciting for me as being able to have multiple mics would make it easier in group settings. For example, in a classroom lecture, one mic would be for the teacher, and the other 1 or 3 mics could be distributed among the students for faster passing around of the mic.

What I'm wondering is, do voice to text apps like Live Transcribe on Android support anything other than mono audio? I figure stereo may or may not work with some apps (and how it treats a stereo channel is a question mark), but 4 channels is probably not common for voice to text apps. I'm also not clear on whether audio devices are available to all apps like Bluetooth audio devices are.

If not, is it possible to mix audio on an Android device and or create virtual devices like I can with Rogue Amoeba Loopback on MacOS?

1i1kuxp,hardofhearing,[Venting] annoying new audiologist,"I've had the same audiologist since I was 7, (aside from now), I've only ever seen one other audiologist and then immediately switched back when I was able due to how I was treated. Well he retired, he was old when I was young so it isn't a surprise.. but he was the only person who always took me seriously, never let me feel guilt or shame for my needs, and was always my biggest advocate. 

the audiologist who took over my case was so dismissve. For context I have ""cookie bite"" hearing loss which causes pretty significant problems in the range of which most people speak at, I rely extremely heavily on lip reading and my hearing aids. She basically implied that if I didn't have such a long history with that office she wouldn't give me hearing aids and was only doing so because I requested. She even stated that with my type of hearing lossnI shouldn't be having problems, as if she is me and hears how I do or navigates this world how I have.mShe also kept pushing me towards colors that would hide them, which she couldn't have known (although, working with the deaf you'd think she would understand) I have a long history of not wearing mine specifically because of shame, the only thing that brought me out of it was fun colors and being more open about their existence. 

I'm upset about how she treated me sure, but really deep down I'm upset at myself. Upset I couldn't advocate for myself, upset I didn't say anything to tell her otherwise, upset I let the guilt and shame of my existence to swallow me whole again .. 

I did the absolute most hated thing someone could do to a doctor, and that is emailed her as soon as I got home with questions and changes I wanted .. then I've been ghosting her for days .. I'm just too afraid to open that email. Which I know is silly, she's obviously not going to send a detailed hate message to a client, but I'm just so afraid. Ughhh I hate this! I know it's not the end of the world, if it's an ugly color I can just cover them with stickers, if they're not vluetooth I'll just need to keep using rely and captioning services, but dammit I waited two years for this and I just froze!

I just needed to vent, yell at anybody what I'm going through even if I'm essentially doing so into an endless void. Feels good to get out. If you got this far or even go as far as to leave a comment know I appreciate you. Thank you. 🤍

For heavens sake, don’t get hearing aids from this person. Switch to a better audiologist! There are decent audiologists out there.

my parents are like this and refuse to buy hearing aids for me, even though every audiologist I’ve been to says I need them. they say I need to adapt and not rely on technology, and once they even ordered them, and then cancelled the order the same day without telling me. So then for a couple weeks, they were like “when you get hearing aids you better not keep asking me to repeat myself”, and then I finally asked them what happened, and they told me, saying “you survived two weeks without asking for hearing aids or complaining you can’t hear, so I guess you don’t need them”. Stupid and ignorant, but it’s what happened.

There are two audiologists at the clinic I go to. I refuse to see one of them, based on how she treated me.

I also have cookie bite hearing loss and it takes a special skill set to program hearing aids for it. It is so hard to be missing that speech range of frequencies.

I also like fun colours for my hearing aids, but sadly Phonak has ""simplified"" their adult colour range. This means boring colours for me now. I've never been shy about my hearing aids, most likely from growing up with my dad and other family members wearing hearing aids.

As an audiologist I can tell you that, as you describe it, this is a situation indicating that this is not the right audiologist for you. I'm sorry this audiologist apparently did not take the time to get to know you and take your concerns seriously. Incidentally, I can't imagine why she would tell you that with a cookie bite hearing loss you shouldn't be having problems. We know from all the recent research that even a mild hearing loss can have significant impact.   
  
My compliments to you for sharing this and not just ""bottling it up"" inside. Don't feel bad about your reaction. You were dealing with a professional who should have known better how to help you. 

As you have found out, it is important to have a good relationship with your audiologist, as you apparently did with the audiologist who retired. I suggest you ""start over"" with another audiologist. 

If you would like some ideas about how to tell if another audiologist is right for you and how to work with her or him to get the treatment you should have just let me know by responding to this or you can direct message me.

I would draft this in an email and send it to her, esp the part where ""she does not hear how you hear"". And I would cc anyone else that could help you.

Let her bosses know of what happened.  And also leave an  honest review of everything.  I had that happened to me andy mother who is hearing was there with me. We had reached out to her bosses and left a review on all the platforms they have. 


It worked for me and the next time I went back she was much more opened minded and was actually making honest connections with people who wear hearing aids.

While attempting, unsuccessfully, to obtain hearing aids through Vocational Rehabilitation, I was sent to a horrible audiologist. He told me I wasn’t a candidate for hearing aids and advised cochlear implants. I told him that was not an option because I don’t have health insurance. He told me I needed to purchase a private insurance plan out-of-pocket. I told him he doesn’t live in the same world I do. Then he said, “Well, it looks like you do OK anyway.”",2025-01-15 00:22:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i1kuxp/venting_annoying_new_audiologist/
1i1ibmz,hardofhearing,Respectful way to stop someome HoH from doing something dangerous?,"Hope this is an appropriate place to ask.  I teach jewellery making to adults in the UK.  There are a few risks (blow torches, red hot metal, extremely fine saw blades).  First class of the new year and there's someone who wears hearing aids.  I show everyone how to use the jewellers saw safely.  Where to position fingers so they won't get cut.  The lady that is HoH proceeded to ignore what I had demonstrated, and started sawing in a position that would almost certainly have resulted in a severely cut hand/finger/thumb.  She didn't respond when I told her multiple times, that the position was wrong.  So I grabbed the piece she was trying to saw and put it in the correct place.

She's now complained to the college.  Making it out like I practically beat her up.

I feel terrible, but didn't know what to do in the moment.  What would have been the respectful thing to do?  How do you quickly get the message across to stop without any physical intervention?

(There is another layer in that she made a big deal about having done a previous course with another jeweller and she was going to do both my beginners and intermediate courses.  However she really had no idea about any of the tools or how to use them.  I wonder if her ego got bruised when she found that she wasn't the expert she thought she was.  So when I told her to stop, I don't know if she couldn't hear me, or was purposefully ignoring me.)

I don’t think this is a hard of hearing issue, it sounds like an arrogant person issue. You did the right thing. She could have seriously hurt herself. In the future, I would ask the HOH person (in private) if they have any questions about the instructions. I’m a good listener but I still miss things sometimes. I’m sorry she’s complaining!

This has nothing to do with being HoH. I’m HoH and took a jewelry (silversmith) making course in New Zealand. All I asked was that the instructor face me if she needed to tell me something specific. And I made sure to sit where I could see her hands and her face. I had fun and didn’t get hurt. Your student is an entitled a-hole who thinks she knows better than you. If possible I think she should be restricted from taking your classes, if for no other reason than that she’s refusing to listen and use tools properly despite lots of guidance. It’s a liability to you if she gets hurt on your watch (even if she wasn’t paying attention).

i think this has nothing to do with being HoH. she was in danger, could not hear you, and was not listening. if she is making it about being HoH that is her issue but not the truth here tbh

You took all the steps I would have wanted you to take. You tried to get her attention in other ways first, and when that didn’t work you saved her from seriously hurting herself. Maybe in a less dangerous situation you could have put a hand on her shoulder or something but if she startled easily then that could have gone very badly.

You did everything right OP. The way she took it sounds like a her problem. I really hope the college takes your side on this like they should.

This has nothing to do with her disability. I take a blacksmithing class every summer and the instructor knows that I'm hard of hearing. With the required ear plugs in, I'm unable to hear anything at all. And since we're working with molten metal, the instructor can't get my attention in ways that might startle me and cause me to flail in surprise. 

So I always make sure that she is aware that I've heard her directions clearly and I will stop what I am doing and look up at her and wait if I need assistance. The instructor will step into my line of vision and either wave her hand (or foot, if I'm looking down at my anvil), to get my attention safely and carefully. 

Hard of hearing people can do dangerous things safely. We just have to put other steps in place to ensure our safety as well as the safety of our classmates. It sounds like this lady just had an ego and didn't want to admit she was wrong or less skilled than she thought. 

You did the right thing by keeping her safe. If she wouldn't listen or stop long enough to lip read, you had to physically manipulate the item to ensure her safety. She should be grateful!

1i0sr3p,hardofhearing,My doctor told me I have a sclerosed mastoid. ,"What does it mean? I asked my doctor but he didn't tell me anything. He is just pushing me for a tympanoplasty for my perforated ear drum and anything else I ask him, he just says, ""we'll see"". Has anyone else had a sclerosed mastoid? If yes how did the treatment go? Does it also require surgery?

[댓글]
How much did the doctor explain? The mastoid is the bone you can feel when you press behind your earlobe. It contains lots of air-filled cells that make the bone look like a honeycomb. These air cells are connected to your middle ear. For various reasons, the mastoid bone can harden or thicken, which means the air cells shrink. This is sclerosis. Basically your air cells are narrower than they should be because of changes in the surrounding bone.

Mastoid sclerosis doesn't happen on its own, so treatment depends on the reason for the sclerosis and how severe it is. One common cause is chronic middle ear infection. As you have a perforated eardrum too and your doctor is suggesting tympanoplasty, it sounds as if it might have been infection in your case. Is this right? Doctors will usually recommend tympanoplasty if the infection didn't respond well to antibiotics and the eardrum hasn't repaired itself within a few months. No one here will be able to tell you if you need mastoid surgery as well, as that will depend on your specific situation.

Don't be afraid to ask the doctor to clarify things for you in writing. It's their job to make sure you understand what they're recommending and why they're recommending it.

I hope this helps a bit. (Disclaimer: I'm a medical student who is also HoH, but I'm not an expert on ENT conditions.)",2025-01-14 00:05:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1i0sr3p/my_doctor_told_me_i_have_a_sclerosed_mastoid/

But when I ask about recovery and side effects he never gives me a straight answer. His behaviour is making me reluctant from getting the surgery. Getting no help from him I went to Google and I was horrified to read about some people's experiences like headaches that never go away, hearing not coming back, faliure of the suregry and needing repeat surgeries. I am specifically worried if there is any possibility of any sort of nerve damage and the shape of my ear changing, like the pinna sticking out more than usual. If you have had the surgery can you please share if you had experienced any life altering long term side effects that I should be aware of so that I can be prepared and make an informed decision. I would really appreciate the help.

I had a tympanoplasty on my right ear when I was 18 and the excess scar tissue that it caused made my hearing worse. Now im 27 and I wear hearing aids and I won’t be getting any more surgeries. When I was younger, my ENT was always trying to fix my chronic ear infections with tubes and surgeries and was very knife hungry. Before the tympanoplasty, it was not thoroughly explained to me how much more invasive it would be than previous surgeries. When it was over and I took the bandage off my head, I was genuinely shocked to see the scar behind my ear and I couldn’t believe how little detail my doctor gave me ahead of time about the procedure. It scared me away from surgeries and now that I haven’t had a surgery in almost ten years, my ear infections and chronic ear pain are completely gone. I never got the surgery in my left ear and have decided to just accept my hearing loss instead of trying to surgically fix it

As far as recovery goes: I remember getting headaches and feeling woozy very easily for like 6 weeks after which made it difficult to work sometimes. Long term, I get very easily dizzy and nauseous and wonder if it has something to do with all the inner ear surgeries I’ve had. But the scar healed very nicely on the outside. On the inside, the scar tissue in front of my eardrum is so thick that you can’t even see my eardrum when you look inside with a camera all you can see is just a thick wall of skin

My son who is 30 and has Down's Syndrome had this when he was about 16.  Prior to that he had multiple severe infections and several sets of tubes, causing a permanent hole in one ear drum.  At the time he was a swimmer in Special Olympics, and because those with DS tend to have smaller than normal ear canals finding any type of ear plugs or other gear to keep the water out was impossible, between his anatomy and under developed OT skills nothing was working.  He ended up having surgery on the same eardrum twice, thankfully both times they were able to do it through the ear canal so there was no external incision.  During recovery from the first procedure he ended up with the nastiest staph infection, the drainage was unlike anything I've ever seen, imagine the worst sinus infection drainage but coming out of his ear, but 10 times worse.  Because of this the pus pushed the patch off.  Once he got over the infection they did the procedure again and it was a success.  It was life changing for him, he went from almost nonstop ear infections to not even once a year now, and he's able to swim without issue. The only side effect has been slightly more earwax buildup in that ear.  For him it definitely increased his quality of life.

Since I'm the one that's HOH and not him I can't speak to anything related to that from him. 

Just try to get more than one Doctor's opinion is my suggestion, ask lots of questions, have a list of them when you go so you don't forget them.

Just had one done a month ago. So really I just know the short term side effects. 

So discounting the obvious post surgery pain and stuffiness, I still get a bit dizzy every once in a while. 

Hearing isn't back all the way but certainly better than what it was after surgery. 

I had the packing in the ear canal removed last week and my ears have been popping about three to four times an hour. The Doctor told me this is just the packing in the middle ear dissolving. 

The Doc took some cartilage from my ear to make the patch so after surgery it was painful and now just a little bit numb. My ear did kind of stick out and looked odd for a few weeks but this was from the inflammation post surgery and has subsided all the way, so I don't think that's a long term worry.

I’m 33, just had myringoplasty procedure after living my whole life with a perforated right eardrum including two failed tympanoplasty procedures and now i finally have hope. Before i tell my story, i had nerve damage on the drum itself from all the scar tissue which meant i did not feel any pain during infections. I could tell from swelling and smelly discharge but no pain which is worrying. It lead to 20% hearing loss which is permanent 

Here’s my story. 
After having grommets as a kid my right eardrum was never the same. After grommets served the purpose of draining the ears the dr had to surgically remove the right one, which left a small perforation to heal on its own as expected. In my case the peforation never healed and infection after infection was the story of my life. Being very active, swimming was always an issue with as little as a drop of water leading to infection and sleepless nights screaming from pain. 
My first Tympanoplasty would’ve been in my early teens, the surgery was a success or so I was told. Post recovery, not sure how long after I remember my ear just popping in the shower. I immediately knew what it was as it sounded like I was covering my head with a plastic tupperware and let the water run over. I was devastated that i had to go through all of that again. I went back to the doctor and he mentioned that the eardrum burst on a different location and that the patch he did was still in tact. It was odd but the ENT had no explanation. 

Few years went by and I figured out how to keep my ear dry by using blue tack or prestik as they called it in my home country back then. The way it took the shape of your ear and sets when it gets wet meant i could surf, water ski and swim with less issues. I did have the occasional infection once a year / two years which was bad enough. One bad infection can have deafening consequences so back to different ENT i went. He tried suggested Tympanoplasty. ( Not sure why a Tympanoplasty was suggested over a myringoplasty) 

This was during my uni years and the surgery was a success, it was during winter months so i never tested the swimming thing before one night we were out partying as students do occasionally and one guy from our crew slapped me on the side of the head as a joke sort off and i could feel it burst. Same shit, different day! I could not recall if this was the same graft the burst or a new hole. All i knew was that if this happened so easily then chances are it wouldn’t have lasted long surfing 6 foot waves. I pretty much gave up.

Another 6 odd years went by before i decided to seek further professional advice. During the first visit the ENT ( not someone i’ve seen before) manually just placed a graft on the drum to see if it can assist with self healing. Given my history tho this was never going to work  👎👎 Haha. 

But then - HOPE joined the party. 

He came to a conclusion that my Eustachian Tube was not functioning properly and ventilating through perforation to manage inner ear pressure. Which made sense but why did it take 3 ENT specialists and with each over 30 years of practice to figure that out! 

He then performed a procedure called Eustachian Tube Balloon Dilation with uses a catheter at high pressures to dilate the tube canal under general anesthetics. He was happy with the outcome. The next step was to perform another 
Perforation repair however before that could happen i migrated to Australia and now 5 years later got me where im now recovering from a myringoplasty. 

The ENT was relatively happy however he mentioned the amount of scar tissue that will affect bloodflow for healing the graft. 
So it’s not all and good yet but I’m confident. ✌️ 👂🏽


Not that anyone gives a shit but thanks for reading. Happy to answer questions privately. Cheers!

I had a tympanoplasty on my right ear back in 2009. This was because the t-tubes I had left permanent holes in both ears. My parents forced me, refusing to help me pay for college unless I did it. I still resent them for this to this day.

Short Term:
- My hearing was slightly improved but not enough to make a significant difference. My right ear is my better ear but they both require hearing aids.
- I got 5 ear infections that year alone which ended up undoing a lot of the initial improvement. I'm still prone to ear infections on that ear to this day and more recently those ear infections give me pretty bad vertigo.

Long Term:
- When that ear pops, it is usually uncomfortable and sometimes even painful.
- The scar where they took the skin still sticks out but with long hair it's not really noticeable and it's definitely not painful. My ear doesn't really stick out anymore than it already did.
- This ear is way more waxy than my ear that still has a hole in it.

It’s scary how little info there is about this, and sadly I only have a scary story. For context I’m 25 and considered deaf on one side. Back in 2017ish I had a tympanoplasty that effectively sealed in an inner ear infection. The ear drum burst in less than a year. The infection made me miserable: constant migraines (and painkillers), constant drainage, daily nausea spikes and a rancid smell on one side of my head. I went back to the surgeon that did it, and he reccomended the same surgery again. I was up front in saying “that doesn’t make sense, I have an inner infection and mastoid cavity that requires further treatment”. The old man just walked me to the payment office, and I left.
I got a new, much younger surgeon in Orlando, who actually appreciated my ability to discuss my condition. He immediately had me CT scanned to look further, and found infected cavities and malformed infected bones around my ear and jaw. He proposed and went through with a tympanomastoidectomy, but when we met a month later, he told me also did some mastoid obliteration, a more extreme measure, to save my jaw and skull from the spread.
I’m fully healed now and the pain, infection and hearing are way better but unsolved. I guarantee you many of us are in some kind of hearing aid pipeline if you don’t have an ENT you really really trust. 

TLDR: learn the medical terms for possible conditions you have and insist on searching for a more modern ENT. You have to be vocal about your conditions to break ENT’s out of the “new patient” or “healthy ear” flowchart, otherwise the consequences may last forever.

I had tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy surgery recently i.e few days back. The surgery took almost 2 1/2 hours. A mastoid bandage is covered for the ear where surgery happened. You won't face any much pain, so don't worry. Sometimes, we can sense something is bleeding from the surgery ear. But don't be panic. But we can face some dizziness in the ear. Be calm, stay positive. You can consult a doctor after a week for review appointment.

As doctor said, takes 3-4 weeks to know about healing after surgery.


I will update the sequence of actions accordingly.

I am 3 weeks post op myringoplasty. Now ear got tinnitus continuously. I worry and have anxiety a lot. Do you have any experience like this?

It’s so crazy looking up this surgery, it appears no big deal…a few days recovery time! How can they put that out there with all these experiences. I am debating this too, more bad stories than good! If all is successful, will I be able to go underwater again? Ever? Can’t tell you the last time I did :( Thx

1. They will provide it, which increases access for everyone 

2. They will excuse you from service, if you want that

1hzpwrn,hardofhearing,Question for adults with mild hearing loss in high frequencies ,"Hi! I need some help understanding how those with mild high frequency hearing loss do with their hearing aids. Are they very helpful? Is it largely noticeable when you don’t have them in as far as speech recognition? Do you wear them at all times? 

My daughter is 15 months and I can’t tell a difference when she’s wearing them. We put them in anyway and she hates them, but I’m so curious what adults with her hearing loss hear with and without them.  

Thank you! 

[댓글]
Children's brains adjust differently to hearing aids than an adults. Age does matter. And at 15 months, their attention span is overwhelmed with trying to figure what exactly to listen too. So keep her wearing them and if you're on FB they have parent support groups

I’m an adult with high frequency loss, hearing aids for my kind of loss didn’t come out until I was 16 years old (30 now). 

They make subtle noises so much more noticeable for me - keys clanging, pots and pans hitting things, etc. and if I’m honest I hate it lol. 

Maybe it’s because I got used to the quiet of the world, I wasn’t able to grow up hearing these sounds - or the true loudness of them, anyway. As the other comment mentioned, I struggle the most with “s” sounds, and I do find it helpful with speech when I have the aids on, but everything else is just so distracting.

When I first got hearing aids (HAs), I was right on the line for mild/moderate hearing loss, mainly at high frequencies. 

What pushed me to get them was that I was having a lot of trouble understanding people with high pitched voices, especially my own three year old son. He didn't want to talk to me because I asked him to repeat himself so much. 

I had trouble understanding other small children, and some women with high-pitched voices, but I got HAs because of my son.

I also had trouble hearing our doorbell ring, and some phone rings. 

The HAs made a huge difference for me. I didn't understand how much my hearing loss was affecting me in social situations until I got HAs and adjusted to using them. They made it much easier to understand people (even with deeper voices) in settings with a lot of background noise.

And for a baby, any hearing deficit can affect speech development.

If your daughter doesn't like wearing her HAs, there are people who can help. Ask your audiologist if they can refer you to an occupational therapist (OT) with experience in this area. They can be amazingly helpful.

It would help to see an audiogram to get a better understanding of what your daughter can and cannot hear

It can be, more so to get rid of the tinnitus for me then anything else.  They aren't exactly comfortable but if I absolutely have to hear what's going on or I want to listen to music in public without losing the ability to hear my surroundings I put them in.  The Bluetooth is incredibly functional, especially with the TV attachment (phonak brand hearing aids).  If you don't get them tuned regularly you won't have as good of an outcome.  I seem to require a change every 3-6 months but I have sinus issues that affect my ears (thus my hearing) as well.

My hearing loss is very odd. It's normal in the 1 to 10k range in my left and severe at high frequencies. My right is mild loss to severe at high frequencies. It's not quite the same, but my 2 cents is that I feel like my head is underwater. Like I'm under a pool when speaking and certain syllables just fail to exist when I'm not wearing my hearing aids. For me, background noise is a killer and hearing in noisy environments makes me physically tired. Hopefully that gives some insight.

I wish I could adjust to wearing my hearing aids. Although the new noises I hear are so loud and I ask my family if something always sounds like that…I really struggle and most of the time I don’t wear them.

Get a second opinion

In my exp., stress can make tinnitus more noticeable. If you have trouble sleeping or insomnia, that can add to it too. 

If the noises you usually hear change/ include a new one, make sure you address that with your ENT doc. As an example of this, I can tell when my bad ear is due for a cleaning 'cause a specific sound changes and it sticks around like a constant noise. The first time it occurred, it frustrated me so much I was too angry to sleep because I swore someone was mowing their lawn all hours of the day.

If you feel dissatisfied with the news your doc gave you, it's not wrong to seek a second opinion. They can't hear or feel what you do. Hearing loss can be an emotional roller coaster. Making sure you're okay is your top job. Your doc should understand that your audiogram results belong to you and if you want a copy of them, they're not allowed to tell you otherwise. If you want your audiologist to explain your results better -- they went to school for that!

 Speaking to a therapist can help too, OP.

Thanks for the tip.  I was thinking of getting those and I probably never would have thought of that and just withered away from frustration.

If you'd rather not rely on the app's hearing test, you can enter your own settings on the AirPods to match your audiogram. That way, I think, you could fake the test and then set the AirPods to the max they can manage.

This is on my list, too. It makes me mad that marketing for hearing aids is that they’re discreet and no one will know you’re wearing them. This translates to shameful to me. Glasses aren’t marketed that way. Anyway, I want some Deaf Metal!
https://deafmetalusa.com/?srsltid=AfmBOop0eHZqH4KID9UricouhT2WskZ_j5GCc5qHLLqBprxqVJNDaWzy

I use the decorations from DeafMetal. I love their products. I'm in my 50s, with a punker background, and I work in a creative field, so I can be a little more statement-oriented with my jewelry. I actually introduce myself as hard-of-hearing, and the decor helps people remember without me always having to say things. I also had some custom pieces made by a jeweler that I attach to the DeafMetal holsters.

I'm waiting around to get my first hearing aid (it's a bone conduction device called Adhear by Med-El) and I was looking through the available stickers on their website and just knew I'd need to get creative! 


I've honestly always wanted an elf ear body mod, so it's super cool imo that elf ears are part of alt fashion. It'd be neat to make something like that with my device. 


Other than that, I've considered just attaching strong adhesive Velcro and changing out the deco that way!  This idea has worked well for pop-sockets for my phones so I don't ruin my cases and can easily reuse the same pop-socket. C:


Thanks for making this post, OP! I've been wanting to discuss this subject and didn't think to look around on Etsy!


I remember seeing on the Netflix cooking show,  [Tasha Stones](https://youtube.com/shorts/4ZSvVPzrJH0?si=zGRfH0SjH8gtcnG-) from GBBO sporting cool chains and earrings from her BAHA!

My daughter did charms from 4-7 years old, but no doesn’t want the attention. It was really easy to make our own out of earrings we found. You can get a bag of tiny metal O rings, and with a pair of pliers remove the charm from the earring and put it on the O ring instead. Then it slides over tube. Have fun with it!

I love decorating my hearing aids! I have often thought about making my own. Honestly, most people just thing they are earrings.

I’ve put stickers on mine and little charms that go over the tube. It’s fun and also helps people remember that I’m hard of hearing

I love decorating my hearing aids, and I think it helps reduce the stigma of deafness. 

I don't buy fancy stickers but cut washi tape to shape. I got a load of nail stickers but they're hard to remove so now I put a layer of washi down first. 

I've also bought tiny charms from Etsy sellers. 

Some people like to put plastic spirals on their tubes. I think there's no point spending out for ones being sold specifically for that, I use the colourful spirals that are for protecting charger cables and cut them to size.

I'm 25 and just got my hearing aids. I already bought some hearing aid jewelery (some are just cute and some keep it on my body especially when doing things like pilates), and tube twists. I also started making my own hearing aid jewelery as it's quite enjoyable and I get to choose exactly what I want to wear! 

I am no stranger to visible assistance devices though. I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user, have a feeding tube, heaven a service dog, and wear custom AFO braces on my ankles. There is no hiding the fact that I'm disabled. When it came time to choose my hearing aid color, I chose green which shocked my audiologist. It seems that a lot of adults choose plain colors, but she said she was also very excited that I chose that color. For me, I want to make my hearing aids as noticeable as possible. I'm not embarrassed by them. I want people to see my hearing aids and realize I'm HoH. I've already had people think I'm lying about being HoH, and just today, someone in a store was talking about my service dog. I heard someone talking and heard ""cute dog"" but couldn't locate where it came from, so I started scanning around me. I finally figured out it was an employee complimenting my service dog, but trying not to distract him. When I didn't respond right away, she thought I was mad as my curly hair was covering my hearing aids. I then explained that I purely just didn't hear her clearly and couldn't figure out who was talking to me. Of course, scenarios like that could still happen even if my hearing aids are visible,  but people believe me a little more when I can show them physical evidence that I can't hear them 

Plus, jewelery is cute. If I can make my medical equipment cute, why not?? It helps ease the stigma a little too that young people shouldn't have hearing loss.

I have sparkly pink and purple skins from Hearing Out Loud on Etsy, as well as silver sparkly sticker covers and I love them. I’m Hoh, there’s no reason to hide it, and it makes it a little less depressing to be progressively losing my hearing since my teen years. I find it helpful when people notice because then they make a point to face me when talking. I work in healthcare and it can be quite difficult to hear sometimes, so having people notice them and make little adjustments so I can hear them is quite important. Also, my patients love them and I’ve had several older patients who have gotten decoration for their own now!

Wow this is very cool 😎

I use to do stickers. It was great until they got stuck in my hair. 

Personally I am not a fan of anything dangling off my hearing aids. It's cute for those who do.

I like Deafmetal! It now looks just like I have another earring without drawing attention to my HA. It also keeps my HA (retention loops are uncomfortable) on securely!",2025-01-10 23:27:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hyi6bc/hearing_aid_decorations/

Not so much shame, as disappointment and frustration. It makes conversations and socializing quite difficult and I tend to isolate or choose not to participate

I don’t feel shame, but I’m often frustrated by it. Luckily, most people in my life are very supportive and understanding, but it’s still annoying having to ask people to repeat themselves and miss out on conversations. I feel like an outcast in society at times, but I’ve also come to accept my hearing loss. It is what it is.

yesterday my boss said something mid lunch rush and I knew I miss heard it so when it came relevant again during prep work 2 hours later I said so am I understanding we do it this way now? and she had the audacity to tell me ""I thought you were smarter than that why on Earth would we do it this way you've been slipping a lot on things I thought You knew. ""

I know I'm deaf as fuck that's why I asked to clarifying question being told I'm stupid while asking for clarification because I knew what I heard was stupid is the most humanizing shit ever and I am this close to punching somebody at work about it.

Yes, and I fight with my brain over this a lot but I know I shouldn't.

It has made me more isolated because I feel like a 5th wheel sometimes, slowing the conversation down, and stories aren't as funny if I need them repeated.  

And then to be told ""I'll tell you later"", or ""never mind"" as if it's not information I need to know.

I have no advise I guess, just wanted to let you know it happens to others too.  Looking forward to anyone who replies.

I am learning ASL even if my friends don't, and seeking out others who are in the same situation (here and online), as well as some hobbies that don't require as much hearing.

I deal with this by accepting that my hearing capabilities are different. I also experience social anxiety on top of being HoH. Both factors make it difficult sometimes to remember names of people I have just met, so I employ the tactic of repetition and being straightforward about my needs. 

I introduce myself first and follow up by stating that the person is welcome to ask me to remind them of such info and that I shall do the same, when required. If a conversation ensues and I mishear something, I often utilize a parroting tactic wherein I rephrase the info said to me so that the other person knows that I understand the subject matter. This provides me with a great opportunity to ask a question or two during my turn -- so, I can address any info I may have misheard. 

As a relationship is built and I get more comfortable talking with this person, it would be then that I may try to joke with them about my misheard words or statements, 'cause we all have to admit that sometimes we think we hear some off the wall shit. xD 

Sorry to hear that you're experiencing shame OP. There should be no shame about something that you cannot control. We can all wish and hope [and pray if we're religious] as hard as we want, but there is no sense in attempts to will this fact of life one way or the other for the lot of us. Accepting that your hearing is going away (to whatever percentage) can be filled with a lot of emotions. Most of those that do not consider themselves HoH or Deaf will not understand until they get older. Grieve your loss and try your best to help yourself through the next stages. Therapy may help. It has worked for me.

P.S. -- Taking ASL classes have helped me regain some confidence and I have built new connections. Perhaps this may be a positive option for you, too?

I have pretty much withdrawn from social occasions. I just do things with my wife now.  It is better for everybody because I keep asking them to repeat themselves even with hearing aids. It is lonely.

Ive felt stigma and discrimination. Ive felt oppression because of it. More American BS.

Yes, of course! I felt like I was ""less than"" other people and that somehow it was my fault that I couldn't hear well. I felt this for years, until I accepted my progressive hearing loss as a fact of my life and became determined to explore everything I could about how to live with it. I use technology to help me, not just hearing aids, but phone apps that do real-time captioning and a Bluetooth microphone that feeds directly into my hearing aids. I took online classes in speechreading (aka lip-reading). Most importantly, I learned to advocate for myself and how to tell people what I need from them for clear communication. It's not easy at first but I have found that most people are quite willing to make accommodations for you if you tell them what you need. A book that I found tremendously helpful is ""Hear &amp; Beyond"" by Shari Roberts and Gael Hannan. In the book, they talk a lot about the importance of your mindset in dealing with hearing loss, and I've come to believe that this is the most important thing.

I work in manufacturing and a lot of us are HoH. Spend enough time listening to heavy machinery and then you can't listen to anything else. I have a hard time hearing higher voices and have horrific tinnitus sometimes. It is so much easier to talk to other floor dudes with a bit of hearing loss than anyone else. 

When I'm talking to normies, they get pissed at me for being too loud, mishearing them, gesturing while speaking, interrupting to ask them to speak up, etc. The one that really pisses me off is if they get irritated at active listening. I'm not making fucking faces at you, I'm indicating that I can or cannot hear you. 

I've straight up given up on socializing with normies that won't adjust or get irritated about it. Been making it harder and harder to have non-work friends for years. 

Been dealing with it a lot lately, so it's a bit of a raw spot right now.

Nope. I feel shame about the perm I had in the 90's.  One I chose, one I didn't, that's the difference.

Yes, I want to hear well like others, but there is no cure :(

I have moderate hearing loss in both ears and was born with it. I’ve adapted so well with lip reading and social cues etc, that people I’m close to sometimes forget I’m actually hard of hearing and act frustrated when I ask them to repeat things. The worst is when a stranger tries to talk to me and and they just assume I’m ignoring them. Ive  actually had people say on multiple occasions that they thought I was super rude. Im sure the amount of people that think that and have never said anything is super high. That’s unfortunate but what’s a girl to do? Wear a sign that says I’m half deaf? When they see me conversing with other people normally face to face I’m sure their confusion is compounded. Sigh.

I was actually born hearing and one day I sudden lost my hearing in my right ear. Now I’m basically half deaf. Most of the time I feel embarrassed about it too. I wish I didn’t feel this way about it. Most people who know don’t even know what happened to me so most of them think I’m just being rude or something. 

I once even had an ex comment about my hearing loss which made me feel worse about it.

I think this is a common experience. I've had hearing loss all my life as well as some resulting speech issues that even extensive speech therapy couldn't resolve. People have definitely treated me differently, made some rude comments, and in school, I was bullied heavily. It's taken a lot of therapy to just accept myself, but I'm getting there. I'm not going to let my hearing loss deter me from participating in life, it just means I may have to do so in a different way. There are people out there with actual things to be ashamed of or embarrassed about and the majority of them don't care. Why should I feel bad for something I can't help and something that isn't hurting someone else? I refuse to let anyone (even myself) let me feel that way anymore. 


My mother has lost some hearing due to illness and age, and she turned to me the other day in amazement at how I've dealt with it all my life. She hates that people get frustrated with her when she asks them to repeat themselves. That just confirmed to me that most people genuinely don't get it - even my own mother, who was the one who pushed to have my hearing assessed at a young age, couldn't really understand until she experienced it. She learned sign and was an active parent, but she didn't really /get/ it. 


All this to say, it sucks, and you're not alone. I feel you.

Tell people straight away you’re hard of hearing. In my experience most people are very understanding

Not so much shame, as trying people’s patience a little, and because I’m elderly, sometimes thinly disguised annoyance….

I get embarrassed too sometimes but I try not to be. On top of all the other challenges I've navigated I've learned how to navigate being hard of hearing and manage to maintain a social life etc. If you can't hear you can't hear, wear your disability with pride

Yes, unfortunately. I know it's not my fault but I can't help feeling so small when I'm excluded from conversations

Not shame but I don’t participate as much in Conversations sadly so feel left out sometimes

I moved passed shame a long time ago and now have zero chill about it. If I can’t hear people, I straight up respond with “I’m deaf, you’re going to have to speak up if you want to continue this conversation”. There are a lot of people who speak quietly, so repeating themselves isn’t helpful and some of the people I see regularly forget I am hearing impaired so they appreciate being reminded so we can have a proper conversation.

Never feel ashamed for expressing your needs. Your need for people to speak louder or to annunciate better is no different to others needing to eat and drink. You are doing the speaker a favour by being honest with them about your need for them to increase volume.

At the bottom of my heart I hate this feeling. Like a void in my heart. Nothing I can do about it. I always ask why I can’t hear just like others. I used to be extrovert character but due to my bad hearing, I feel like I am trapped in this HoH. I tend to avoid any social interaction if I could now as it is so frustrated and exhausted  to just focus on hearing of what people try to say.

Nope. I just tell people that I can’t hear squat and to repeat themselves.

Na, pretty much everyone I'm around knows. We rarely go out to loud/dark late night events at this point, and our friends get it. This holiday season, even the extended family in law made a point to get my attention before speaking. Just gotta settle into it and be clear on your needs

Personally no 'cause I don't want to hear these dumbasses in the first place. I wish it was possible to tune them out even further but simultaneously get to enjoy my music/not be deaf.

So yeah, I have 0 guilt considering how most people act. They're dumb, they're loud, and they absolutely enjoy repeating themselves. Why feel guilty for having a medical condition?

My boss not so subtly accused me of lying about it.  So... Yeah! I guess my HAs are fake lol!

I have felt like a burden in the past, but i wouldn’t necessarily say shameful. you can’t change your hearing loss. i’ve gotten much more confident in being able to ask people to repeat themselves and simply laugh it off when i mess up. maybe it’s easier for me because the people around me are very accepting. hearing loss isn’t the worst thing to live with, you could have a terrible personality and that would be shameful fs. you need to start loving and accepting yourself, being hoh can be cool!

I’ve felt this way before and despite being 58 I sometimes still feel this way mostly when I’m feeling insecure. But, I think the feeling of shame is universal to all of us but for different reasons.

I have to ask people to repeat sometimes also, but it depends on the person, if they talk fast, have a soft voice, or have background noise.

I'm not ashamed, it comes in handy when I'm in an environment where I don't want to hear anything and will turn off my devices. It's great being able to do that especially in a loud place where I'm alone. 

It does get frustrating when people have to repeat themselves but I've been dead/HoH for over 30 years so I'm used to it.

I had a severe mastoid infection that required IVs that messed my hearing up well at the age of 34. Which was 3 years ago. For me, I feel very isolated. Even with hearing aids. To the point where I just don't want to be around anyone if it's going to be loud. I am trialing new aids that help a lot with background noise and I'm hoping that they help. The way I cope is, not well. Honestly. What has helped is telling people I'm hard of hearing and they need to slow down their rate of speech, not speak up.

I feel like this all the time. I get sighs and eyerolls when someone has to repeat themselves. I was told just get hearing aids. In one year I got bifocals dentures and now hearing aids. It is not something I asked for and it is not as easy as people think. But I'll get the hearing aids and just stay in my room.

1huy0tr,hardofhearing,Using my Sonic Alert alarm clock in apartment?,"Does anyone else use a specialty alarm clock? I’ve had the Sonic Bomb extra loud alarm with a vibrating plate and flashing lights for over a decade and it’s fantastic.

I’ve been living with my parents for the last few years so they didn’t mind, but just moved to a new apartment with thin walls. I’m really worried I’ll get a noise complaint using my alarm. I’ve been using it with just the vibrating plate under my mattress and lights, but the sound is what really gets me up. Any suggestions? 

[댓글]
Maybe a good idea to make your landlord and neighbours aware. Explain that you’re HoH and use a speciality alarm clock to wake up but hope that it won’t disturb them

I also found that mine was too disruptive to other people so I started using a vibrating sweatband style watch alarm (CoolFire on Amazon) and it works just as well to wake me up without being annoying to other ppl, and I find it easier to set the alarms from my phone rather than the device itself

Smart watches can work too. Mine vibrates when my alarm goes off. Of course you have to get used to wearing a watch to bed. I'd already gotten used to that because I like to use it to monitor my sleep.

Do you think a strong smell would wake you up? My brother isn't hard of hearing like me, but he is a notoriously heavy sleeper. The man practically goes into a coma every night. He's impossible to wake up by most methods, including my alarms (we tested, just for fun to see if they'd work on him. No go. I moved and reset them for nothing. Lol.)

However, setting his coffee pot to brew at a specific time in the morning woke him up without fail. He had to keep it on his bedside table so the smell was super strong. But it was the only thing that could get him up in his early 20s. (We're in our 40's now, so I have no idea how his wife and kids wake him up or if he's become a lighter sleep as he's aged.)

They make a sonic boom alarm wireless one where you can use the app to set your alarm and how long it vibrates, and you can have it make a sound also

I use a big tv to wake me up. The brightness of it wakes me up every time.

I use the Sonic Boom and I say use it even if neighbors hear. As long as you’re not waking up when it’s typically “quiet time” after 1000 at night.- ( see if your lease specifies or any ordinances where you live). Noise is to be expected from 6:00 in the morning, all day, and some of the night. 
It’s the vibration that wakes me ( I think), but hey it could be the sound for all I know.

The one I have isn't as disruptive to others as the Sonic Boom. It is wireless.

Bonus is that it connects to my phone, and it has multiple alert options. I can have it set to vibrate for my Ring alarm (doorbell, smoke alarm), it can also alert for blood glucose monitors and text/other app messages

1hurh1s,hardofhearing,Trying to determine if I have hearing loss,"For context i’m almost 18 and I was diagnosed with APD (auditory processing disorder) at a young age. I haven’t noticed too many symptoms related to the condition besides that it’s hard to drown out background conversations in an environment. Another thing to mention is that I listen to a lot of music. I don’t blast my music on the regular but there are many times where I’ll gradually increase the volume because it becomes the new “standard volume” if that makes any sense.

This potential hearing loss was brought to my attention a few weeks ago in my music production class when a friend pointed out how it was funny that I use the headphones at near full volume and that he can hear what I’m working on even though he doesn’t sit right next to me. Then he started making jokes about how I’m gonna lose hearing. One thing lead to another and we started running our own “hearing tests” and there were many times where I couldn’t hear or make out what was being played at a low enough volume when he was able to. We got another classmate to do these series of “tests” and it was a similar result. This situation shook me a bit and got me scared that I actually have hearing loss. 

The following weeks I’ve started to notice that there are some instances where my hearing is slightly below the mark regarding certain things. At a New Year’s party there were a few times where I couldn’t exactly make out what was being said. Today at the gym my friend told me to quiet down because I was talking too loud. I’ve also noticed that medium volume on my phone kinda feels like what low volume would sound like. 

It’s hard to know what I should be taking as legitimate signs in these situations as I’ve only noticed it recently after being super paranoid that I have damaged my hearing after running some BS “hearing tests” that were done by a bunch of unprofessionals. Its also had me question whether the APD is a factor or not but I’m not particularly sure at this point. Should I take this up with an audiologist or is this just some sort of placebo effect? 



[댓글]
It's absolutely possible that your APD is playing a big role here. In all of these scenarios listed, there are so many variables to take into account and there are no measurements of sound (db values) here to really say anything meaningful in regards to whether you've damaged your hearing. I would really recommend getting a hearing test done if you're worried about it and get an audiogram for yourself.

I just experiment with it using the shape of the audiogram as a starting point. Your left and right sides are fairly similar which is good because most Bluetooth headphones don’t have separate L/R settings. Unfortunately most apps don’t give you a wide enough range to really flatten it out.

1hqmrxk,hardofhearing,Trying to have automatic captions on phone calls on the computer,"Hello! I am Deaf but I speak fluently in my mother tongue (Portuguese - European). And Microsoft Teams is currently the best application that automatically live transcribes in Portuguese. Everytime I have meetings I ask them to use Teams, not Zoom, Meet, Whatsapp, or whatever - already tried them all and live transcription for Portuguese language is just best with Teams, with a LOOOONG distance in the quality of the transcription for any of the others (Google Live Transcribe sometimes works good, but fails constantly). Therefore, even in personal meetings, I start a meeting on Teams ""alone"" on my computer or smartphone, and just watch what it captures as captions, works really good on controlled environments (and badly if you have stupid environment music or noises).

Well, said that, I tried something: I did a call (to a bank... that didn't answer emails or any written stuff, only phone calls, arguing that they record the calls and they can be used for security or dispute purposes). and I turned on the smartphone's speaker (""alta-voz"" as we say here) so that my computer microphone captured the sound. Then I opened a Teams session. And I was able to do a reasonable phone interaction with the bank by reading the automatically generated subtitles on my lonely Teams session (they appear as being said by me as the sound goes into my microphone, but who cares).

Now, I am trying to find better solutions, also because they asked me to turn off the speaker when I speak, because with the speaker on, they have a hard time hearning me correctly (lol, now that the problem hits them, it's me who has to adapt, too...)  and therefore I have to turn the speakers off when talking, then turn them on again when they speak, so that my microphone captures the sound.

Isn't there an easier way to configure the computer so that I connect my smartphone to it (e.g. by Bluetooth using Phone Link in Windows) and then have all the sound going through the computer until it reaches the running Team apps?

1ho0tfq,hardofhearing,What is a funny moment you’ve had because of being HoH?,"I’m sure we’ve all had hilarious interactions due to being Hard of Hearing and I’m curious to know some of yours.

My friend is going to Tanzania today but we were talking about his trip last week for the first time with our group of friends. Because of being HoH and the way he pronounces Tanzania, I thought he was talking about ‘lasagna’. So, for about 20 minutes I couldn’t understand why him and my friends were excitedly talking about lasagna and hiking, and I just thought it was an odd snack to take with him hiking.

[댓글]
I was talking to a friend once and I thought he said the name Jennifer. So, for about 10 minutes he continues talking about “Jennifer” all the while I’m confused wondering who’s Jennifer, turns out he said genitals and had been talking about that to try and get a reaction which actually made him laugh even more.

I always eat lasagna and bacon while hiking in France with my bitch-ass boss named Jennifer. So this thread makes total sense to me. But I HATE it when I run into that pesky abdominal snowman! ☃️

so I largely only hear the stress syllable words so I played mad gab a lot in my head. 
What I heard: Eh - O - Ish - as. 
Internally: ayo, sayo, mayo, hey yo, ....
What I finally came up with: Hey yo bitch ass? 
What he said: Hey, do the dishes. 


Since this was my mean boss I asked him to repeat himself twice more. Finally got the real answer

I used to work the front desk at a hotel and sometimes guests would come for a funeral. We always asked, “what brings you in today?” And most of the time I didn’t understand and would just say, “how fun!” It wasn’t until my coworker would say something that I realized and apologized profusely. You wouldn’t believe the number of times this happened to me…

For me it’s consistently funny: I can’t say the word abominable, like the abominable snowman. That’s the abdominal snowman.

Not HOH but still funny..

I thought my dance teacher said she needed a beer

This isn’t funny, exactly, but in the early 90s I was in a bar and someone told a story and I couldn’t hear what she said and had to ask her to repeat herself several times and eventually she yelled a sentence that equates to “their grandmother had sexual relations with an African-American” using the most offensive language possible. I was mortified.

I'm a Brazilian speaker and I had always pronounced ""Pizza"" as ""Piikisa"" when in my mother togue it's pronounced something like ""Piitchsa"", and it took several attempts from my friends to make me learn the difference between the pronunciations because as a hard of hearing I had difficulty distinguishing these soft phones.

A friend of mine told me a friend of hers, named Pete, was moving to Colorado. Why did I hear it as “Pete was moving to Colorado to be sodomized.” I was so embarrassed!! However, me and my friend laughed so hard we almost peed ourselves.

I was at a gathering for my wife's family and met her cousin's husband for the first time. He told me that he was a PE teacher. 

Over the course of the conversation, he talked a lot about his kids. I started to get concerned as all of his stories involved his kids bodies.

It turns out that he is not a PE teacher. He's a pediatrician.

Lol. I had that too. 


Someone was talking about the ""breweries"", but I thought they were talking about the ""prairies"" for a good 20 minutes. 


It's a lot of nodding and smiling, as you try to connect the speaker's words to make a coherent story.

Just today! My aunt spoke about ""Yorksire Peach"" (influencer), I misheard ""You're the bitch"".

Also my bf once said ""I like that girl's boots"". I looked at him angrily and said ""Just you just say you like another girl's boobs?!?"" Hilarious, we still laugh about it years later!

1hnwo0z,hardofhearing,Question for the masses! “Is it hard for you to wake up or not? And why?”,"So, for context, I am having this conversation with my wife who’s fully hearing on both ears.

I am completely deaf in one ear and hard of hearing with a hearing aid in the other. Taking it out means I don’t hear anything, period. 

I was explaining to her the difference in being able to get up/wake up when I have absolutely no hearing at all. Which I do take out my hearing aid at night cause you’re supposed to, duh! 🙄 

But! Sometimes there’s those nights that you are too tired to do anything and you just end up falling asleep with it on. 

The one thing I’ve noticed very clearly is how much easier it is to wake up when you can hear things, your body is able to respond right away. Where as without, I feel like there’s definitely a difference.

Am I wrong on this perception? I’ve been struggling all my life to be able to get up so easily. I do have a vibrating clock, Apple Watch too. These help! 

I want to see the differences in opinions and perceptions on this topic.

[댓글]
I think you hit it on the nail on the head. That it is easier to wake up. 

I don't wear my hearings to bed. But I have a dear childhood friend who does and she wakes up to everything that her hearing aids pick up. She finds it calming meanwhile I find it stressful to sleep with them on.  

She is a morning person and I am a night owl. I am convinced it has to do with her sleeping with her hearing aids.

How many hours do you sleep? Some people need 9 hours to get properly rested, and many sleep too little.

I love thee quiet, so I take mine out at night. I wake up every day between 4-5. I’m retired so I don’t really get out of bed that early and I read for an hour or two. I have a sweet dog who alerts me when something important happens, like a kitten who’s starving 😹

I’m no where near as hard of hearing as you but I struggle with sleep and walking up. I can hear alarms and bird chirping so I wake up at noise but typically roll over and go back to sleep cos I’m so tired. The last couple of days I’ve been so tired I didn’t hear the door being knocked on for a delivery or my phone alarm so i didn’t wake up

It’s definitely easier to wake up when you hear sounds. I live with family who all are hearing and sometimes when there’s a lot of noise by weather or someone snores really loud there are conversations about that people are annoyed that they woke up by this sound where I slept through it.

I’ve actually seen a documentary where it was about hearing and one section was about sleeping and hearing. Turns out that your body continually listen and reacts to sounds even if it’s a bird or a cat while you’re sleeping. Your ears doesn’t stop hearing

waking up got harder when the hearing got a step worse now that you say it I see it

i have never considered the connection between my profound hearing loss and how hard it is for me to wake up. thank you.

I tend to get about 7-8 hours of sleep a night. If daylight doesn’t wake me, our cat does! The pitch of her meow is very audible (when other noises are not).

I can’t hear squat when my aids are out. After my husband died I had a lot of difficulty waking up in time for work. He woke me up every day for 30 years. If I am really tired, the Sonic Boom alarm clock does nothing to awaken me. I’ve even got up, shut it off, gone back to sleep. When I do get up I don’t remember shutting the alarm off. My work called the police to do a welfare check on me as it was t like me to just “not show up” without some kind of communication ( for example calling in sick). 
I got Long COVID after he died and am now disabled and live alone. The crappy thing is if I know I have to be somewhere the next day, I can’t sleep because I can’t count on myself to awaken myself on time. It sticks.",2024-12-28 03:22:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hnwo0z/question_for_the_masses_is_it_hard_for_you_to/

All and any would be much loved,, thank you

Sign language...

My audiologist right now is really nice and considerate. My hearing aids get adjusted to my liking and fixed when needed. 

I had audiologist before who were very vague and completely unconcerned with my wellbeing. Any question I had was usually just dismissed. I think since they deal with older patients a lot maybe that’s why there’s so much contempt? 

I wished I had leads to speak to someone on mental health with hearing loss, from someone that had a background with understanding HoH. My audiologist couldn’t find anyone, but that’s maybe my only wish.

no matter how much you try to help to adjust sounds and make it as 'normal' as possible (which i do appreciate), it's never going to sound normal. it's always going to sound different than i want it to be, which in an ideal world would be my full hearing, so dont get discouraged if your patients tell you something about the audio is not working. in reality, i just want my hearing, not that i dont want your help, if that makes sense

I’ve worn hearing aids most of my life, more than 40 years. I have seen A LOT of audiologists. Some great, some very bad. 

For me the biggest thing is the audiologist needs to have the language and framing to ask good questions about why the HAs aren’t right. When I was a kid I’d say “they don’t seem loud enough” and I’d be kinda criticized, like “loud isn’t something we can work with, be more specific.” Uhhh, I can’t hear well enough? 

The audiologist needs to send the new HA owner home with some tests or things to pay attention to, and some words to use: mushy, tinny, spiky.

Just a reflection. I find many HoH, especially new ones, to be extremely hearing oriented and ignorant of how hearing loss actually works. I believe teaching people to get perspective, learn visual strategies and sign, process things emotionally, change mindset about deafness and so on, are much more important than the actual hearing aids for our wellbeing. If someone is miserable, it’s often because they have unrealistic expectations, try to everything in a hearing way and simply lack the tools to handle a HoH life.

That not everyone’s experience is the same. One of the worst audiologists I saw had been deaf in one ear since birth. In the words of other members of staff at the clinic, they were great with children and those who’d lost their hearing as a child but had no understanding of losing your hearing as an adult. Every appointment I had they very much had an attitude of “Well I don’t struggle with that”.

Even if we had the exact same hearing loss type (we didn’t). Two people can have totally different experiences.

I’d honestly have them ask if they’ve had anyone go over their results with them in the past. Let’s just say I was raised in [a cult known for medical neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science) so asking questions about testing or what it means is not an easy thing for me.

more training on CAPD! bilateral hearing aids are being tried for those of us diagnosed CAPD and they do wonders for me, but it requires delicate programming and willingness of the audio to consult the literature and experiment (my audio told me it's bc of how new this research is)

That when I say something hurts, it hurts. Sounds, domes, tubes..

Let the wife, husband, and kids be the voice when you are in the box trying to hear the different words being said

Hearing people will never know or understand what it's like to be deaf. My audiologist will make an adjustment to my hearing aids and say ""How does that sound?"" If everything sounded like the audiologist voice then that would be great, I don't know how anything sounds until I get out into the real world outside of the quiet audiologist office. Everything sounds different with each adjustment, when I had Analog hearing aids I could hear great, even on the phone. But since 2012 when they went full Digital I haven't been able to hear like I used to and the audiologist gets upset because I can't get the right settings to hear like with analog, the audiologist said""You just have to get used to them"" that's like saying I have to get used to living in a country where I don't speak the language. I go without them alot and just have to accept that it is what it is. I do wear them occasionally if I go like to the tire store. But other than that I just don't wear them. I personally believe that the BEST kind of audiologist, the ones that understand what it's like to be deaf, is one that is hard of hearing and wears hearing aids like their customers.

The experience is stressful with highs from upgrades to aids to lows because they don’t perform as well as you hope leaving you disappointed. We are going thru a lot even if we aren’t showing it.

That not all conductive hearing loss is a temporary issue due to a cold or allergies.  Mine is due to erosion in the ossicles, and a few too many audiologists acted as if I'm wasting their time getting a hearing test.

When we have our hearing aids or cochlears out, we cannot hear you. Lipreading doesn’t help much if you’re moving around all the time.

If the person wants a specific hearing aid setting to be changed, please try your best to follow through, we are living with the devices every day. 

Don’t automatically suggest cochlear implants each time a client comes through. Sometimes going deaf is the best option for some of us

Stop telling me my hearing hasn't gotten worse when I know that it has. Weird how every single audiologist I've seen over the past couple of decades has assured me that my hearing hasn't gotten worse (and even argued with me over it) when my most recent hearing test is vastly different from my first one. The change from one hearing test to the next not being ""statistically different"" doesn't mean that my hearing isn't worse. Stop gaslighting your patients, even if it's unintentional.

1hnw9zl,hardofhearing,Chronic ear problems ,"I’ll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. I grew up with chronic ear infections. About 10 years ago I had an ear infection so bad I went completely deaf in my right ear. After treatment, I recovered a good part of my hearing back but never got it all back. I’ve had occasions over the years where the ear bothers me more than other times, and have had a lot of liquid draining from it in the past year than any time previously. My spouse got me one of those earwax scooping tools with a camera and this is what I have found. I can’t find anything from basic symptom googling to explain what’s going on, so here I am.

It appears to be multiple perforations and growths as well as some pretty heavy scarring. I am very averse to going to the doctor for a multitude of reasons, but at the same time can be convinced if I am given enough reason. I’m hoping for some sort of answer to what I’m looking at to determine if there is even a point in going/chance in recovery or if things just are what they are. Thanks.

I am not an audiologist or ENT but I AM a healthcare working… the purulent discharge, redness, apparent swelling, and other discoloration are all signs of an infection. Not to scare you, but untreated localized infections can turn into systemic ones and literally kill you. I see it all the freaking time. *Please get it checked out asap.*

And if you need more convincing to see a doctor this week the healing of the infection will reduce swelling and build up which will help what is left of your functional eardrum do its job. You will likely get more tones back. See a doctor immediately, that is a significant infection and it being so close to the blood brain barrier, if it goes bad it goes bad very quickly.

That is absolutely infected. Seek antibiotics

Any chance we can nsfw these? Tia

Go to a doctor.

You dont need a plethora of reasons, you need to go get it looked at by a professional. To even be asking if you dont need to is worrying. Be brave, put your aversions to one side, and go see a professional. This is only going to a whole lot of bad to you if left untreated.

Okay so if you can't get to a doctor for whatever reason get your hands on some colloidal silver and start rinsing your ears out with that. Otherwise I agree with everyone else that you should probably see a doctor.

Please go to a doctor STAT! Preferably ENT, but any doctor will do

Please keep up updated once you've seen a doctor. Good luck!!

According to my sign language app, learning sign language is for everyone and the more people learn it the more inclusive the world is. I am HoH for the record

I am hoh (hard of hearing) since birth, and wears hearing aids. English spoken is my 1dt language and asl is my 2nd language. 


I think the ASL langue itself is lovely and is very important to know because of you find urself in a sticky situation having some basic signs down is better than none. And also your sense of community/belonging/ yourself worth of how you know yourself will also expand and what you thought are quirks might turn out be the standard/norms of your deaf/hoh community. 

There will be people on both sides who won't understand your reasonings and that is ok because you are doing this for you.

What is L2?  I am new here and recently developed a hearing disability

I want to learn ASL, but I keep putting it off

It's very worth it - especially if your spouse knows it as well, it's an excellent way to have a quiet discussion where you need it - like at a crowded noisy park, concert, table side argument at a restaurant without raising the voice, a way to figure out a plan to get out a unwanted event earlier, a way to talk when the ears are muddled from being sick or wearing a toque/beanie. 

Useful for scuba diving, sky diving, hunting, near skittish animals without making a sound (especially pointing out a bird while birding).

Besides, if normal people lose hearing from age - whose to say it won't affect the ones already with some hearing loss?

YES!!!! I learned ASL b fore I became HoH and I used it constantly before that. It's a beautiful and gorgeous language. It's got cultural contexts that help you understand Deaf Culture better too. Please learn, everyone should have some sign language in their repertoire

I started learning ASL before I even lost some of my hearing. I'm HoH, with a progressive type of hearing loss and have been recommended to continue in ASL classes (which is wanted to do anyways.). My mom is also taking ASL classes right now, and the couple of good friends I have, told me they would continue to learn ASL as well if I continued to lose hearing. Now, I want to meet people in the Deaf community, but that's a little intimidating to me.  All that to say, I don't think learning a second language is ever bad as long as you're learning from the right places.

I love sign language! I'm far from fluent but even now it's nice to use sometimes with my partner (he is hearing) to better communicate. I really want to learn it better (I mostly speak Norwegian sign language and it's harder to pick it up online)

Worth having as a second language compared to what? 

I think learning another language is great in general and everyone who has the opportunity should try.

Yes. Needed hearing aids since I was 5. I took ASL at the community College to meet my high school language requirement. My mom decided that since she had to drive me, she would take it too. We both had a little crisis throughout that year- she felt like she hadn't given me the opportunity to be around other kids like me and learn a language that could change my life, and I of course wondered how things would be different had I grown up with ASL.

Neither of us continued past that year of study, but now I'm married to a man with an auditory processing disorder and we use basic ASL at home on rough days when verbal conversation isnt an option. Now I wish we had the funds and time to take a more focused class as we have a 10 month old son and im worried we dont use asl enough for him to learn for the days that we do need to use it. YouTube is really helpful, ASL Meredith and Learn to Sign because they have vocabulary set videos. There's not much out there for people who aren't total beginners, it seems.

I never learned ASL, but wondered about it on many occasions. I have only encountered a couple of times I could have used it, and both times I was able to hear what I needed to without ASL supplementing what I was hearing. 

When everyone was wearing masks during COVID, I could have used ASL, if everyone else knew it.",2024-12-27 03:00:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hn5ab2/is_it_worth_learning_sign_language_as_an_l2/

Then House puts a CI in his head during brain surgery without his consent! I’m so upset!!!! I want to skip this episode, but I keep watching, hoping they’ll ‘fix’ the way they’re viewing deaf people…

[댓글]
House is, from a realism and ethical standpoint, an absolute trashfire. The show is basically a renegade detective police procedural with a ""medical"" coat of paint - the writers' goal is to create a thrilling drama, with very little attention paid to the medical side of things. House regularly does all kinds of awful things without patient consent, generally treats vulnerable people in desperate situations like dirt, and the medical accuracy is dubious at best (remember the episode where they erase someone's memory of another person with electrodes? Somehow?). House only gets away with his complete disregard for patient autonomy and humanity because it's fiction and the writers can just make him magically 'right' every time.

Their Deaf/HoH representation is awful, but that's pretty consistent with their representation of everything else.

I was born with normal hearing. Now I have a major hearing disability. I have to wear hearing aids. I love House MD, but Dr. House is a character who treats most people like crap. (Kudos to the writers for creating a lead character who is such a butthole, yet I still like him and root for him!) 

Yes, it’s just a fictional tv show but it can stir up emotions. And those emotions are real emotions. 

I remember this episode and it bothered me a little bit. Not a lot, but yeah I totally understand where you’re coming from. I suggest finishing the episode and then perhaps watching something else for a day or two, just as a palate cleanser. 

If you are like me, just writing about your reaction and posting your thoughts and feelings helps. I hope it does! 

Were there other tv shows that you’ve watched that had poor representation of hard of hearing people or deaf people?

For me, since I am also hard of hearing.. I use hearing aids daily. 

For me I. Don't necessary find it offensive because of that one moment. The fact with all disabilities he was the same. I would take a offense if he only did that to the hoh child. 

Yes  tv is oftentimes wrong. And with house it's the same. the only difference is that sometimes houses atttudite is spot on to my own personal experience with doctors.

House is an asshole to everyone.

Very inflamed. Possibly scaring or tympanosclerosis. The quality of the picture is somewhat blurry but in the first picture, it seems your eardrum is also bulging somewhat but it could just be the angle. If it is, it may mean fluid in the middle ear.

PS. Not an ENT or health professional.

1hm0sqr,hardofhearing,TV soundbar suggestion ,"A couple of people in my family have hearing issues. One of them uses hearing aids, the other does not. Both struggle with understanding TV speech (news, soap operas, etc) and frequently resort to alternative shows that have subtitles. The TV is a recent, low end LG flatscreen, so nothing special audio-wise.

I was wondering if getting a soundbar would help them understand tv audio, or if it’s just money poorly spent. If it does help, any actual brand+model suggestions would be welcome. 

TIA

[댓글]
A lot of us only use subtitles. I watch everything on a Chromebook and I have live captions on for any program that doesn’t have subtitles. I’m never going to be able to hear well enough to rely on sound. Maybe you could teach them how to get subtitles all the time on their devices.

Even on shows without subtitles, closed captioning may be available as a setting on your television.  Unfortunately, the speaker positioning on flat panel televisions (especially if mounted inside a wall unit) is terrible for projecting sound.

I have moderate single sided mixed hearing loss and was having such a difficult time hearing speech on the television.  It was an LG TV, so I added the corresponding LG sound bar to see if it would help.  I love it!  I still have a hard time with some voices, but it would be so much more difficult without the sound bar.  They probably work across several manufacturers, but I'd suggest going with the same one as the TV.

IMO, it's worth giving it a try.  It can be returned if it doesn't help :)

I have a small soundbar about 15 inches long (Taotronics) that plugs into my laptop via USB, and a Marley Chant Sport to connect via Bluetooth to my phone, so as someone who can't hear conversations on TV without subtitles, I agree that a wireless soundbar or speaker system placed strategically next to or between the listeners is way helpful. I put the speaker on my right, about 24 inches or so away, and I'm all set.

[댓글]
Hearing people are used to hint noises that indicate a presence long before a conversation, footsteps, woosh of wind, breathing, fabric rustling, shifting of things and the like.

Hard of hearing and the deaf do not have such ""help"" and are lucky to figure out the presence from wooden floors or being vigilant from reflective surfaces.

It's frustrating because it's tiring being vigilant all the time, it's like being in a jungle in a fight or flight state all because someone finds it funny to scare a fellow for a chuckle.

It's low key abusive if consistent over time. Once or twice in a while, especially Halloween sure but enough to need to post online about it?

That's a need for conversation about respecting boundaries, empathy in relationships and understanding how frustrating it lingers in the mind if such events happens often.

Sudden noises scare many people, yes.

I’ve always startled easily in my house, etc. but it’s much worse with my hearing loss. If my family members come into a room and see my back turned they’ll flash the overhead light to get my attention, and it really helps.

sudden noises scare me too! i would just tell your wife that sudden noises scare you, and then maybe you guys can talk about how she can help, ex: moving into your vision before saying something. as for your coworkers, i'm not sure. maybe after figuring out how to accommodate you with your wife, you can try a similar approach  with your coworkers? best of luck. happy holidays :)

This sounds like it has to be an open conversation more than once. Respect has to sometimes to told and communicated.

When I suddenly lost my hearing my school still forced me to continue band until the end of the year. There was this time when the teacher was absent and the sub that we had at the time came up to me and scared the shit out of me.",2024-12-24 15:38:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hlg0cw/help/

And then turns out it wasn’t a yes or no question, so you’re just sitting there nodding with a dumb smile on your face hoping for the best, and they’re giving you a look that says uh wtf

It’s because they repeat it in the exact same way and tone of voice. Lol.

I hate this so much it makes me look and feel so stupid.

The other day I was walking my elderly golden retriever and someone came up and asked me if my dog had a nice life, and I was like “yeah she’s loved a long and happy life!” The woman was SO confused and looked at me like I was crazy, she goes “um, I asked you if she shed a lot?”

Sort of makes me feel a little better to see this discussed here… It’s so totally me. I’ve learned not to say what?…. because I don’t hear it the second time either. Just got Apple earbuds with the hearing option… Maybe they will be good….

Yeah... too real. Especially if they are looking away the entire time. Please just let me read your lips. I don't even need much sound, just let me see what you're saying... literally.

lol, and   I move closer each time in hope that I can hear what that person is saying

That's when I pull out the phone and have them either text it or see if the live transcribe can figure it out.

You need to tell them what you need.
""Please talk louder.""
""Let's go to a quieter room""
""I heard abc, what did you say after that?""
Or say what you heard and they will correct you.

Yeah it's noisy here, let's try that a bit later.
(And then remind them later)

Yay my life as a meme

By the second what I just nod my head and pretend I heard.

Hahaha yes this is so me. I think about three times is my limit before I just smile and nod or say yep!

YES. funny enough though, my close friends can totally tell when I have no idea what they said and will repeat it more clearly for me. They even said they would learn ASL for me if I continue to lose my hearing. Everyone else, I just accept that I might look dumb and they'll have to get over it. If it's important enough, they'll figure out how to make sure I know what they said

My wife is my hearing aid

Some people speak also too fast... People seem to also not care about hearing loss.

I’ll just say “that’s true” till they give me a weird face 🤣

SO MUCH THIS. If they repeat it and I still can't understand I switch to saying stuff like 'sorry say that again for me' or even just 'I still couldn't tell what that word/phrase was, can you say it again?' 

Caveat being that I work this hard for stuff like work, family, etc. If it's random small talk I just smile and nod. But seriously the number of times I'm just sitting there smiling and they're staring at me waiting for a response to a question lol. Then I eventually go 'Sorry were you asking me a question? If so, I didn't hear a word of it.' lmao

I just say yes the first time around and wait for them to either repeat themselves saying ohh you misunderstood or until then I myself realize it wasn't a yes no question but I can't answer them now because I had already made it awkward 😭.

People could be saying idiotic things like, “we should totally build a space station on the sun” and I’d be like, “Yup”

1hkqjhx,hardofhearing,Audio Processing Disorder? Tone Deaf?,"I can easily remember the lyrics to songs.  I can even predict song lyrics fairly accurately but I can't remember the melody of songs, even when it comes to my favorite songs.  Rarely even the chorus melody. So when someone asks me to sing something I am totally lost/confused. I can however speak the text outloud. I can only sing decently if I have made up the song myself.  Is this the case with people who are tone deaf? My speaking voice has been described as pleasing. I can hear the melody when I am listening but I forget it super fast.

  
Another issue I have is that I cannot tell where sound comes from at all. It is super disorienting. I can hear the sounds clearly but they could be beside me or outdoors it is all the same to my brain. I had lots of ear infections as a kid if that explains. It is at least partially possible that I am predicting what people are saying rather than hearing it because on the phone where I have less cues I have a harder time comprehending speech. Again the voices sound loud and clear but it is disorienting and weird. Touching the person and looking them in the face helps a lot. Is this an audio processing disorder?

[댓글]
From my understanding not being musically inclined doesn’t have anything to do with hearing loss. You need to seen an audiologist to know if you have hearing loss we can’t diagnose  you.

Not being musically inclined and being d/hh are two different things. “Tone deaf” is used more to highlight insensitive thoughts and actions than it’s used for the literal definition.

Go to an audiologist and see what they say. Central auditory processing disorder can only be diagnosed using really specialized equipment and after a lot of other options have been exhausted.

The only way to know is to go get your hearing tested. Free at costco.

Voice lessons. I've seen a friend go from completely unable to hold a tune to accomplished vocalist with voice lessons. You may just need some ear training to recognize pitch intervals and become more familiar with musical scales and patterns.",2024-12-23 15:49:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hkqjhx/audio_processing_disorder_tone_deaf/

Hi everyone,

I am an AI engineer working on a speech recognition model designed specifically to help people with speech difficulties. My goal is to train the model on audio samples where individuals attempt to say words (e.g., someone trying to say ""Apple"").

However, I am facing a significant challenge: acquiring relevant audio data. I completely respect the privacy and comfort of individuals, so I’m looking for publicly available datasets or support from people who can help provide such data ethically and responsibly.

If you know of any sources, datasets, or communities that might assist, or if you're someone who is willing to contribute your voice samples, please let me know. Your help could make a significant difference in improving accessibility for people with speech challenges.

Thank you for your time

1hkjfka,hardofhearing,Persistent Blocked Ear Sensation,"Hi everyone!   
I’m a 24-year-old guy, and for the past couple of years, I’ve been dealing with an annoying sensation of a blocked ear in my left ear.   
  
It’s not a sharp discomfort, but rather a persistent feeling that makes my ear seem like it’s always partially obstructed. I’ve already seen an ENT specialist (though not with a probe), and I was told that my ear is in good condition and that the cause is likely related to stress, which has led me to fall into a vicious cycle: I felt my ear blocked and constantly tried to ""unblock"" it by swallowing or pinching my nose and blowing.   
  
I did this so often that, according to the doctor, this constant ""manipulation"" ended up self-inducing the sensation of blockage.   
However, lately I’ve noticed a slight, almost imperceptible loss of hearing in my left ear. Sometimes, when I eat, I also hear small popping sounds, always in the left ear, which seem to come from inside the ear. In the past, I’ve had to remove earwax, but recently I was told that there’s nothing unusual.   
  
My fear is that the hearing loss might worsen, and that there may be no way to recover it. I feel like this sensation is also affecting my mental state because I’m constantly worried about the health of my ear, which only seems to make the situation worse.   
  
Is it possible for the sensation of a blocked ear to persist for a long time due to stress, or could there be another explanation? Any advice would be really helpful, as I’m becoming increasingly worried that the situation might only get worse.   
  
Thanks a lot in advance!

After the removal my tinnitus was not better. They told me to wait a few days. Now its been 4 days and the tinnitus is no longer present 24/7. When its quiet there is no tinnitus, but when there is some noise the tinnitus appears again, allthough its a little more quiet. Is this a concern? or should i wait a few more days to see if it disappears? Ive read somethign about that its maybe called sensitive ear or something

I have tinnitus sometimes to quiet it down i wear [earplugs.It](http://earplugs.It) works for [me.It](http://me.It) will never go away.

It is different for different people. I have constant tinnitus 24/7. This drives some people mad, but I have somehow made my peace with it. I have simply accepted that this is how my life is now, and how it will always be. 

I’ve been told different things about ringing ears: a) sometimes it goes away b) it never goes away c) it will get better/lesser d) it will get worse 

Mine is bad but has never changed for the better or for the worse. I am simply used to it now. It is from hearing damage due to extremely loud concerts and the last concert I was literally right next to a stack of huge amplifiers. 

I suggest two things for you to do:  
go back to the same ENT and let them know what is going on  

Then go to a different ENT for a second opinion

I had tinnitus for 1-2 weeks in one ear after earwax removal. There was a total blockage in that ear, so I think it was re-acclimatizing to the new (lower) pressure. The NP recommended I take Flonase to ensure my sinuses were clear so that pressure could equalize, and I started that a few days after the office visit. Symptoms were much better after about a week after starting Flonase (per label, it takes a week with double-dose to get up to full strength). I also took vitamins and magnesium supplements, figured they couldn't hurt.

How are you feeling now?

I really hope this hearing loss isn’t permanent I have about 25% in my hearing ear as the other one is completely deaf 

 

[댓글]
See if you can get to an ENT asap. When you call, make sure to tell them that the hearing loss was recent and sudden. Sometimes they're able to do more when the issue is treated immediately.

I have been in a similar situation exactly a year ago and if I could go back in the past and say something to me it would be this:

There is no amount of time, money or effort that is worth a potential hearing loss turning into something permanent.

I'm hoping you can convince your audiologist that this is urgent. This sounds like a very urgent thing - your circumstances seems limiting but you know, effort is what changes things. If it really is unlikely, then don't miss that Wednesday appointment.

Now here's some stuff I looked up for you...

Eardrums do heal (depending on the extent of the damage) but there are a lot of things that gets in the way of that. 

I just looked up some stuff for you on the what not to do in the meantime:

Do not go swimming or get your ear wet until your eardrum heals.

Do not put anything inside your ear, such as cotton buds or eardrops (unless a doctor recommends them)

Try not to blow your nose too hard because this can damage your eardrum as it heals.

Avoid air travel until the eardrum heals


Depending on the cause, people may have ruptured eardrums in one or both ears. If only one eardrum is ruptured, then they may feel more comfortable sleeping on their back or on the side of the opposite ear, with the ruptured ear facing up.

People who think they have a ruptured eardrum should see a doctor right away if they:

Have a head or neck injury 
Feel very dizzy 
Have significant hearing loss, such as difficulty hearing other people speak 
Have a fever 
Vomit or feel nauseated 
Have an object stuck in their ear

I'm hoping whatever happens, it turns into a transient issue more than anything else.

edit:
WOW! We have the same type of profound hearing loss. Dang. I really can see myself in your shoes quite easily.

1hirohe,hardofhearing,"What is the difference between them? deaf, hearing impaired or hard of hearing? ","Hello everyone, how are you? I have a dilemma about how I identify myself in relation to my condition. I was born hearing and at some point in my life I lost my hearing due to antibiotics. I use implants and speak normally without sign language. I know that a deaf person is usually someone who has profound hearing loss and a hearing impaired person is someone who has mild to moderate hearing loss and uses technology to hear and communicate. Am I right about this?

[댓글]
I truly believe we should all self identify as what feels right and comfortable. My hearing was damaged at the age of 5 years old. Therefore I self identify as Hearing Impaired because my hearing was impaired/damaged.

You are right about the difference between deaf and hard of hearing. The term hearing impaired isn't used any more as it can be seen as offensive. And the difference between capital D ""Deaf"" and lower case d ""deaf"" is connecting and interlinking with the Deaf community and culture. The lower case is just relating to the status of hearing, not necessarily relating to the culture or community.

ETA, there are many people who are hard of hearing, but consider themselves Deaf because of their lived experience and connection.

One of the things disability rights activists encourage is for people to be able to describe themselves the way they feel comfortable, and to not assume that there is one ""right"" way to refer to disability. For example, some people prefer ""person first"" language, like ""I have autism"" and some prefer ""identity first"" language like ""I'm autistic.""

Deaf has multiple connotations. There's ""capital D Deaf"" which encompasses a language, culture, and identity, and refers to people who use sign language and participate in the Deaf community. Someone's degree of hearing loss is not as important as their participation in the culture. In a similar way, many publications have started capitalizing Black to denote that Black Americans have a shared language and culture — the same way we might capitalize Italian or Irish Americans — where their number of Black ancestors is not as important as their culture connections. 

Small d deaf refers to a physical disability. Anyone with hearing loss can use the term, I will often refer to myself as ""partially deaf"" even though I would never refer to myself as Deaf.

Personally? I HATE the term ""hard of hearing."" I do not like saying ""I'm hard of hearing."" ""Hard of"" is just a bizarre way to describe it. No one says ""I'm hard of seeing"" or ""hard of walking"". But HoH is a term used by the Deaf community, so I appreciate that it's something with cultural value.

Hearing impaired is also not a disability friendly term, but, again, personally I hate it less, I'd probably be more likely to say ""I'm hearing impaired"" than ""I'm hard of hearing.""

Mostly I just say ""I can't hear you, can you speak up?"" I tend not to identify with my hearing loss at all. Which, for better or worse, is probably because I was raised thinking that it was a bad thing.

deaf typically implies basically no hearing 
hearing impaired visually means volume and tone issues and physical damage to the ears. And I am hard of hearing which is way more broad. I have aphasia after a Brian injury, I hear stressed syllables only most days, having a podcast in my ear helps me keep tuned into the patterns of human speech. My ears work just fine but I am hard of hearing.

I'm in the in-between of HoH and deaf. I have been HoH for 20 years. Hearing aids did the job. Recently, i lost most of the hearing in my left ear. The aid in my right ear wasn't enough. Without HAs, I will only hear the shouted MOM from the other room. I think I am approaching deaf very quickly. CI scheduled in January.

This is a great question. 
Unfortunately , one hundred different people can give you one hundred different answers and they’d all be correct to some extent. 

I have extremely poor hearing. I have to use hearing aids. Over the past few years, I have come to realize that “hard of hearing” means vastly different things to vastly different people. Plus I’ve never liked the term itself, even before my hearing problems. 
I was born with normal hearing. 
Now I’m closer to deaf than to “normal hearing”. 
So now I identify myself as “hearing impaired.” 
I personally feel this is completely inoffensive and completely accurate. And it lets people know that I really do have a serious problem.  

I used to say “I have trouble with my hearing” or “I’m hard of hearing” but people never seemed to understand how bad my hearing actually was. Then I started to say things like “I’m 80% deaf” or “I’m 90% deaf”.  People sometimes say they are deaf and exaggerate (even if they have a legitimate hearing issue) and it can be confusing. 

Now I say “I’m hearing impaired”. It’s easier and gets the point across. People seem to instantly understand what I mean. 

I never identify as “deaf” or “Deaf”, because I am still able to hear a little bit. And Deaf culture is a real thing and I would never want to offend people who are truly Deaf.

Deaf refers to someone who can’t hear or has extremely limited hearing whereas a person who is HoH has some form of hearing.

I use hearing impaired and hard of hearing, but i’ll sometimes use Deaf since my hearing is progressing into that territory. The general ‘rule’ of thumb is: if you can use hearing aids, HOH or hearing impaired, if you can’t, hearing impaired or deaf",2024-12-20 19:31:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hirohe/what_is_the_difference_between_them_deaf_hearing/

You might have APD (audio processor disorder). Ask your doctor or audiologist for advice etc

There are situations in which it is common/normal for even hearing people to struggle with hearing which is important to remember. 

You’ve passed two different tests so you should feel confident that you’re hearing is fine. Since there is a history of genetic hearing loss it should have flagged at your appointment if you had that. Therefore it’s reasonably safe to assume it skipped you. 

Another two possible causes could be tinnitus or auditory processing disorder both of which should have been touched on during your appointment.

Go back to your audiologist and tell them you're still struggling. I have central auditory processing disorder and it requires pretty specialized testing as you basically have to rule out every other possibility. There are also other assorted hearing disorders that could be. Go back to your audiologist and keep advocating for yourself.

I have this, as do many others. Or rather, like many I have trouble picking out voices in a noisy space and my hearing can be overwhelmed by noise. I took a hearing test this week and was fine. The symptom is one of those associated to the APD generalized condition mentioned in another comment, but I don’t have the other symptoms, the ones about language processing, just that I have trouble hearing sounds. To translate what my specialist told me, it’s an executive processing problem in which you can no longer tell which sound is which, both directionally and in volume. Like with APD, there is no cure, only treatment, and that is essentially: try to focus on what’s in front of you, use your eyes to process what the lips say, what the mouth says, and learn to match that to the sounds you hear. It may be because the links which process fray with age and genetics, so they become inefficient. It’s similar to the loss of night vision, meaning the loss of contrasts in shades of dark while driving. I can see fine in the dark, but my eyes don’t adjust very well so the loss isn’t ‘absolute’, meaning I can see if I take my time, but ‘relative’, meaning I can’t see the contrast changes quickly and efficiently enough to drive safely in low light without glasses. It’s the same with hearing: I can hear but the processing takes a bit longer and thus I lose the natural flow of information which makes being in a conversation. I just bought Apple Airpods Pro to try the hearing protection feature that controls background noise, so I can go to restaurants without feeling like I’m shutting down.

There's a difference between hearing and understanding people. 

My hearing was fine but my comprehension wasn't and I ended up getting a cochlear implant. It made a huge difference.

You passed, but I'm curious if it showed any loss in the high frequency ranges, 80% understanding may mean that your missing some consonants in words that are in the high frequency and while that may not be enough to say you need hearing aids, it can cause some words to be misheard. 

I also have hereditary loss that began with high frequency.

Beyond that, other tests are needed as folks have said.

I assume you already got any earwax blockage removed right? Like others here say, got to the ENT DR , or neurologist to see if it's another thing. I wouldn't be so dare to tell you that it must be an attention problem because you have a history of family with hearing loss. The last thing I can recommend is, try to listen to subliminal frequencies, other audios on YouTube for hearing loss recovery and see if it works for you.

I’d get a 2nd opinion. Get a new test at a different place, letting them know your history and letting them know everything you said in this Reddit post. Hearing and understanding are two different things handled by two different parts of your brain.

hey i have having the same issue (expect for the family history of hearing loss) how are you doing now?

i think i have the same issue. I took a hearing test. They did the bone conductive one. one where i had to repeat back what i hear and also answer questions. and also the tones. I passed all of them and audiologist told me my hearing is fine... Op did you figure what the issue was.

1hhrzmq,hardofhearing,Battery PSA,"The new law that went into effect about battery safety has caused some unintended consequences. I used to keep batteries in my purse and my gym bag. Swapping new batteries was never a problem until this week. You need scissors to get the batteries out of the package. I decided to cut a bunch of packs up and put the loose ones in a plastic bag because I'm not always going to have scissors with me. Yesterday my batteries died at the gym. So i quickly replaced them and neither of my aids worked. When I got to my car i called my audiologist and they told me to come to get them checked out. 

Turns out that it was the batteries, not my aids. The tech told me that she had recently learned that loose batteries can't be together because it kills them. So now I've found some battery holders that keep the batteries in separate slots to keep them away from one another. 

I'm still going to struggle with these batteries because I'm old and I have a serious medical condition with both of my hands. I will definitely get rechareable aids when/if I need new aids.

Go to the pharmacy and look in the clearance section. There might be normal hearing aid battery packs available there.

I'm a (relatively, 34) younger person and this bothers me to no end. I understand wanting to make the packaging childproof, but damn, they made them adult proof too. Plus, I don't always find myself around scissors. God forbid I have a battery die while I'm driving. I'm hoping this law will prompt someone to make a carrying case that's a comparable size to the retail packages.

I’ve recently had tympanoplasty about 2 months ago (2 weeks with packing, and 2 with drops), and at first, my hearing went way up, to the point it was almost unbearable! 

However near the end of my 2 week ear drop journey, I noticed my hearing went down to about 40% compared to before. Noticed my ear feels quite full as well as some popping still when yawning.

Thank yah! 

EDIT: 
Fully healed! However unfortunately not much of an improvement with hearing. Back to where I was pre surgery hearing wise.

Welcome to the club. Heck be happy you could hear 2 weeks! My hearing went down on the first day to completely “deafness” (I could hear internal noise, like chewing and my voice) and took 6 weeks to become barely functional. 8’weeks to resemble useful. And now I think week 10 finally can have conversations again. 

Doctor says “normal” takes 16+ weeks. 

Hang in there!!

Any loss of taste ?

Had the surgery on Thursday, hearing was crazy loud when I first came out so I was feeling optimistic. 2 days later and its gone back to being muffled like it was before surgery and im stressing a bit tbh. I had a large perforation so im worried its not going to stick. I suppose only time will tell...

I'm 7 weeks post op. My hearing is still not much improved but what is most aggravating is the pressure/clogged feeling and the tinnitus. I feel a little better about that as it seems like some of you still had that fullness for some time. I just want to make sure this is normal. I do feel some popping and had a couple mornings where I thought it was better but the pressure just increases through the day. The tinnitus is also very loud. Did all of you have these same issues 7 weeks post op or was it just the hearing? I told my doctor at my follow up at around 5 weeks and all he said was the ear may never be the same as the other one. I get that but this pressure and tinnitus should resolve. Did anyone else have the same issues while healing? How long did it take for that to start getting better?",2024-12-18 23:49:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hhfelq/hearing_decrease_after_tympanoplasty/

When was the last time your hearing aids got tuned and how regularly do you wear hearing aids?

Analog or over-the-counter aids will do that because they turn up the low frequenting and drown out any increase in the high frequencies. High-frequency loss is expensive to correct. On top of that, you may have an auditory processing disorder, and your word recognition may not be the best. ""How"" sounds like ""Cow""

Make sure your hearing aids are set by a professional audiologist to your most recent audiogram. 

Also:  You may need newer or upgraded hearing aids.",2024-12-18 12:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hh0w0e/is_it_just_me/
1hghg56,hardofhearing,Feeling slight bloackage in my right ear and a bit of tinnitus but no ear wax,"So i have a slight blockage in my right ear, kinda like if you are earbud in only one ear. Other than that i also got a bit of tinnitus. It kinda varies in intensity, but is worse when its quiet. I checked the ear but apparently there does not seem to be any wax in it, but my left ear has. I ordered an appointment at an ear clinic to have my ear cleaned or something. But could it be because the earwax is further in my right ear than in my left, and therefore causing a blockage?

1hfwj0b,hardofhearing,Hearing suddenly getting worse,"Hey guys,

So my hearing over the last maybe six months or so has gotten very bad. I feel like both of my hears have to work together to get 60% of what most people can hear. My right ear is especially bad, if I have an earbud in that ear or something I literally cannot hear anyone. I don’t really listen to my music loud at all, I mostly use over ear headphones. It’s just recently gotten to the point where I’m like oh shit this is really bad. I do have an appointment with an audiologist in January but I don’t know what to expect. My primary looked in my ears and I don’t have any wax and I have one of those ear cameras and don’t have wax. I’ve used a qtip in my ear maybe 3 times in my life and have had one ear infection. It’s really worrying :(

[댓글]
It’s good that you have an appointment. The audiologist will have you sit in a booth with specialized headphones and play tones over them. You will indicate when you hear a tone. Then they will have a recording say words. You will repeat the word back. With that information, they will create an audiogram that maps any hearing loss. From there, you may be recommended hearing aids if you have aidable loss. Or you may be referred to an ENT for more testing. You don’t say your age, but I started losing my hearing in my forties. Due to my age and my pattern of loss, I was referred for an MRI to be certain I didn’t have anything like a tumor, which I did not. 

If you are recommended hearing aids, I highly recommend getting them if there is any way you can afford them.

The audiologist will ask you questions, look in your ears and then do a tone test",2024-12-16 23:14:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hfwj0b/hearing_suddenly_getting_worse/

1hb61hc,hardofhearing,11 month old started removing his left hearing aid. Need advice.,"Dear all,

My main problem at the moment is in the title. My 11 month old was fitted with a Phonak Sky Lumity M three weeks ago. We live in Germany. He has a mild to moderate hearing loss, mostly in the high frequencies. For two weeks he waited patiently for me to put the hearing aids on and did not touch them.
Last week he started to take the left one out. He doesn’t cry or look unhappy while doing, as far as I could tell. He started doing it in a noisy environment. When we put it back in he pulls it out again. Now he has started to do it at home. The right hearing aid is pulled out no more than 3-4 times in total. Usually after pulling out the left one. Yesterday he crawled around the apartment with only the right one in because we couldn't put the left one back. He didn’t let me.

Our audiologist suspects an ear infection, but the doctor hasn't found anything. We can't get an appointment with the audiologist before Christmas. According to one of the BERA tests, his left esr had a slight hearing loss (about 25db), according to the second - 45db. It's hard to tell because he wasn't fully asleep during the test.
At the audiologist appointment we were able to see a response of around 35db. I am concerned that the hearing aid fitting is not correct.

I also see that he is interested in putting the silicone earpiece in his mouth. It could just be interesting for him, but I am not sure what comes first - the urge to understand what it is and that is why he pulls it out, or it bothers him, he pulls it out and then wants to inspect it. If it is the fist - why pull out only the left one?

Has anyone else experienced this? Can you recommend any techniques to help him stop pulling it out? Or should we remove them until our next appointment in January?

Do you have any alternatives to Oticon SafeLine for not losing aids when out and about? We haven't tried any alternatives but it looks bulky and uncomfortable for a baby in a stroller.

Thank you all for your answers and suggestions!",2024-12-10 16:44:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1hb61hc/11_month_old_started_removing_his_left_hearing/

For Americans, based off Google info, so maybe totally wrong, because the internet: he got tubes placed in his ears and now he is grumbling/whimpering in his sleep.

I'm an adult who got grommets so can only give pereceptive based on my experience as an adult.

My grommets were uncomfortable for a few weeks but I can hear alot better now. But when I was lying down I'd have weird pain or pressure in my ear for around a month. So I wonder if that is something he's experiencing?? Like another commenter I could hear alot more noises that I completely forgot about, which also made it difficult to sleep.

I had tubes (grommets) as a kid. 


It was uncomfortable  for a couple  days (similar  to a freshly pierced ear, but in the ear) and after  that it was fine. Generally if he's fine in the daytime it's probably not too uncomfortable. 


Also - I remember  my second time  with them I had trouble  sleeping until I got used to hearing  better  because  I was used to not hearing noises like the fridge or a toilet flushing  down the hall. Could be that's  the issue  with him.",2024-12-09 17:06:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1haejks/good_day_all_i_have_a_question_my_son_got/

When I did my enrollment I let the school know my disabilities(hard of hearing and visual impairment)and gave them my family doctor note and información. They told me everything was good and ask what I needed, I let them know and was told I'll be a few weeks but would accommodate. By July nothing had been provided and I was making due with what I could with whatever resources I could provided myself.(expensive caption apps) In July I was told I needed my specialist to sign me off on accommodations. And if your in america you have crap insurance you know you can just call and make an appointment for the next day. So in July i made appointments for said specialist (retina and audiologist) the appointments given where for Dec.9 &amp;30th. I been emailing the school letting them know to fill out these forms I need to be absent from school. Nursing school is intense and having 2 absence can qualify you to be drop out of the program. 
I don't know what to do anymore I email and call since July about this and I don't get a response the program ends I'm July 2025. I'm struggling so much in school. Any advice would be helpful. I live in California/Los Angeles

I got an FM transmitter for college funded by the state department of vocational rehabilitation which was part of the unemployment department. Do you have any access to something like that?

You might look into a CapTel phone if he benefits from captioning - they’re fairly easy to use and come in large font models

You can find some of phone options on this site: [https://www.diglo.com/](https://www.diglo.com/)

They have other deaf/hh assistive tech too that he might find useful. The company has  been around a long time (although they rebranded/renamed a few years ago). I am not affiliated. I've used their products for years.

Captioned telephones are free to those who have hearing loss. It is a government sponsored program. CapTel is one of many providers. Contact them and they will do the paperwork, come to his house to install it and show him how to use it. 
Also have him go back to his audiologist and find out why his aids are not working properly. The might need a fitting adjustment or he may need an upgrade. 
There are also speech to text apps to use on a smartphone. My favorite is AVA. I use the free version. Apple has a speech to text app that is imbedded right in the phone. InnoCaptions is an app that works like a captioned phone but works on his cell phone. 
Finally Williams Sound makes several assistive listening products. Their Pocket Talker is a very handy device that can help in restaurants and other noisy places.",2024-12-06 23:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1h8femm/landline_phone_for_dad_who_is_hard_of_hearing_usa/

[댓글]
I watch something else.. lol

Google chrome has some captioning for their browser, it helps me a lot because I watch a lot of live streams. Otherwise, report and wait a week for them to generate.

When I see a grayed-out CC option, I make a decision based on my interest in the video and the creator. If it's a recent upload (like less than one hour) I give it a few more hours time. If the Creator hasn't added CC by then, I notify them in Comments that CC option is missing.

I comment that the captions are disabled. If they respond to say they fixed it, I go back and watch, otherwise, not worth my time.

Sometimes it takes a bit of time for the automated captions to generate. If you’re trying to watch the video within 24 hours of release, you might retry later. I regularly see this with the late night shows I watch on YouTube (Seth Meyers, Colbert, etc.).

You can report the video. Then three weeks later YouTube will send you an email saying they reached out to the person who posted the video but they haven’t responded back. It sucks.

When you find out let me know bc this is an issue for me too

I back right back out of that video. If their HOH/deaf viewership is high enough this affects their income and brings very quickly reverse course. YouTube makes it insanely easy to be lazy and turn their auto captions on.

I pull out my phone and use google live transcribe

Watch YouTube in Google Chrome and turn on the live captions in Chrome. I do this for Zoom meetings too because Google’s captioning is just way better than Zoom captioning.

You can ask them to put the captions up. If they don't then you can report them to YouTube.

In Windows, look at the accessibility control panel.  There is an option for captions to come on when there is sound, and which keys to use to control it manually.  For my versions it's Windows key + Ctrl + L.

Windows 11 has the ""Live Captions"" function which will work with any app

https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/use-live-captions-to-better-understand-audio-b52da59c-14b8-4031-aeeb-f6a47e6055df

I use my phone's Live Transcribe function. Does as well as auto-titles for me.

Sometimes this happens to me if I watch a video while it's too new. I guess some creators upload their own captions instead of relying on the auto ones, but the captions don't always go up at the same time if that makes sense. 

I hate not being able to turn on captions. I can hear the video fine enough, but what I didn't know before is that my brain has to work harder to fill in some of the speech sounds I miss. Captions help me with being able to focus better, too. What I do if I don't have them available is I use my head phones, if I still feel like watching. But having to turn them up is annoying, because some frequencies are still pretty ""loud"" for me.

Chrome live captions, Apple/Mac live captions, etc are options

Automatic captions on my iPhone if it’s something I really need to watch.

Usually auto captioning becomes available using Google AI but it takes some time to process. Are you watching brand new content?

Use google captions

https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/10538231?hl=en

I have a screenshot but can’t post it here

My problem is videos that have captions say unavailable. They're there briefly and then disappear.

Why is it not an account setting to have captions turn on by default. Seems like a good premium feature

I’d like to know too- every audiologist I’ve been to provides audiograms with dB loss charts, mine currently saying 75-100dB loss- but I keep meeting people who say they have for instance 60% loss… 

I almost wonder whether they don’t realise the charts aren’t a percentage…? So does that mean I have 75-100% loss depending on frequency…?

It's a made up number as far as I know.

Percentage is only used when determining disability qualification/payments. It’s not a measure used by audiologists. You can’t accurately find a percentage because hearing is measured on a logarithmic scale, meaning it has no “bottom.” Someone can hear at -10 dB, for example. 

Using the level descriptions and your lowest dB you can hear at are more useful.

You don’t— the percentage thing is a quick red flag that someone has no idea what they’re talking about. Hearing loss is measured in decibels — it can be useful to say what the average loss is (for example mine ranges from mild to profound but average is 70dB). Of course, not everyone knows what that means either.

I have found that other people struggle to comprehend my decibels lost so I try to contextualise it using a percentage on what it feels like to me compared to when I had full hearing. I think it's more for the normal hearing community than if I'm having a conversation with someone else who experiences hearing loss like I do.

My audiologist says that’s not a real number. It’s measured in decibel loss

John Hopkins is pushing a campaign to standardize the use of a hearing number. They tell you how to calculate it. https://hearingnumber.org/  Their website makes it easy to understand what the numbers mean.

I wonder this too. I've always said I've got 27% of a hearing person's hearing whenever I've had to explain my deafness to someone, then I happened to mention it to the professor who recommended a BAHA to me and he asked me where I got that figure from. According to him, percentages aren't a thing and that's not how it works. I have no idea where I got 27% from but it's always been a part of my life.

guestimation based on how much I'm aware I'm missing out on. As someone who has fat more aphasia than actual physiological damage I don't even get a made up number! It's good, good enough, good with audio stream assistants, FUCKING WASTED like a man 9 sheets to the wind trying to hear any string of words.

I tell people I’m 80% deaf because I personally feel that without my hearing aids I hear about 20% of what is said to me. 

It’s just my own personal estimation but it lets people know that I have profound hearing loss. If I say hard of hearing , they have no idea how bad my hearing is. If I give them decibels, their eyes glaze over, lol

Im not confident on this but for me, my ENT described my hearing loss as 80% loss. Or with 20% hearing, as referring to how i scored in how many words I got in the hearing test. I can only discern 20% of speech.

1h5vg72,hardofhearing,3 month old daughter has normal to mild hearing loss for high frequency sounds,"Hi - I just found out yesterday that my daughter has normal to mild hearing loss for high frequency sounds. She failed her newborn test and was tested at 2 months (didn’t pass but thought some fluid in ears still) and just retested yesterday to confirm not fluid but something structural.

We are going to move forward with all the recommendations from our audiologist (hearing aids, early intervention etc) so that there won’t be a significant impact to her development.

This news is super fresh (less than 24 hrs) and I’m still processing all my emotions. All I want is for her to have a normal, happy, fulfilling life. I know this new information means there will be additional challenges that she will need to overcome. 

I don’t want to downplay the seriousness of her hearing loss but at the same time I don’t want to make it a big deal. I dont want to make her feel like she different from everyone else but I also want to recognize her challenges. I’m so scared that she will feel insecure and limited by her differences and I’m scared she will also be bullied / not accepted because of them

So I guess my question is are you happy with your life? What have your friends and family done to make you feel loved and supported and fulfilled in your life? What can I do to help her live an amazing life?

Hey , I was born with mild hearing loss and I didn't get HAs until 1st grade. I think that I turned out good. Got my masters degree, got married, kids, etc...... have a ""normal"" life. 

My dad did his best growing up to make sure I was treated like a normal kid. He stopped my school from unnecessarily placing me in special education classes. I did not need to be removed from regular classes, because I was a straight A student. I think this really helped my confidence growing up, and enabled me to feel like I was no different than anyone else. I always viewed HAs the same as kids who wore glasses. My hearing loss was not super severe, It was mild. 

Be there for your kid and remind her that she can do anything she sets her mind to. She will be fine :)

I like my life. I wasnt diagnosed until young adulthood but i have moderate cookie bite loss (mid frequency, was mild-moderate originally). We have no idea when my hearing loss happened, if i was born with it, etc. I didnt have any speech delay so it was probably mild if anything as a kid. I did have trouble pronouncing certain words, specifically the word wasp i couldnt pronounce until like a couple years ago lol. I would say if you raise her to have confidence and be secure in herself she wont have too much trouble. If other kids are mean to her thats a problem for them not for her, and bullies tend to give up quickly if they never get a reaction from you. People also just dont notice. At all. Kids probably will but as an adult i regularly have to tell people i straight cant hear them at all because i blend in too well.

Focus on getting her into a solid close friend group. Multiple friends, not just one. This provides protection against bullying and also makes her feel included and normal. Keep her mainstream as much as you can without denying any tools or things the school can provide. If she tells you she has trouble with something, believe her and help her strategi,e instead of insisting she can do it and she just needs to try harder.


When i was diagnosed my parents were skeptical despite me having multiple tests done at multiple times. This was unhelpful. They did end up paying for my hearing aids though bc i was in college, so that was great. On that note, set up a savings for her hearing aids as a young adult. I have no money and am only able to start saving to update mine bc i recently got a better job. I would be screwed if mine died today, i cant safely do my job without them. So having a savings for her that she knows about, will help alleviate anxiety as she grows if she decides to use hearing aids long term. It would be an amazing gift if you could stash away a signficant amount for her that could pay for multiple upgrades over her young adult years while she is getting her footing in her chosen field and maybe not getting the best pay yet. Same vein, set her up to be smart with money  and maybe nudge towards well paying careers. As she becomes a young adult, have those conversations about how she needs more money in her job than her peers.

Things my friend group/chosen family do that help-allowing me to choose a booth/seat at restaurants so i can hear them, passively watching my back without making me feel like im being babied, learning how to make it easier for me to hear them, not scaring the crap out of me by walking up behind me or allowing others to do so, especially if im doing something with background noise or i cant wear my hearing aids. 

I think tbh youre already doing a ton. I really wonder how my life would have been if we had found my hearing loss earlier. I did well in school but i also was chronically extremely stressed for many reasons, and i wonder how much of that was the hearing loss. I didnt realize how much i was lip reading until i got hearing aids and could write notes without seeing the teachers face, it was crazy.",2024-12-03 19:16:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1h5vg72/3_month_old_daughter_has_normal_to_mild_hearing/
1h5jn4p,hardofhearing,Clogged ears causing me extreme anxiety! ,"Hi guys, so I’ve had middle ear infection on both ears for just about over a week. I caught it early and got antibiotics day 2 of infection, so I’ve been on Cephalexin for 6 days. The intense pain from infection has died down, don’t need heavy pain meds anymore, but the pressure and aches are still there and this horrid feeling of the clogged ears, muffled hearing, both blocked, and tons of pressure. I’ve tried every trick with drinking warm fluids, garlic oil in ear, massaging, excessive yarning, warm compressions, the bloody lot. I go through phases of panicking and thinking I’ll be stuck like this for months, especially with searching stuff up too. Somebody please give me some clarity it will get better or if anyone’s experienced this before and have tips!

Best advice is to follow your doctor's advice and speak to them if you're concerned. It sounds like your ears are just blocked up from the ear infection though and will sort themselves out in time, I'd think of something nice to do to distract yourself.

You could try hydrogen peroxide as it has been known to help with ear infection but talk to your doctor first

1h5jloo,hardofhearing,What’s the Most Frustrating Thing About Miscommunication?,"Hey everyone!

Miscommunication happens to all of us, but for those in the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (HOH) community, it can sometimes feel like an everyday challenge. Whether it's in conversations, at work, or even when trying to order a coffee, those small misunderstandings can add up.

What’s one moment of miscommunication that really stands out to you? Was it frustrating, funny, or something that taught you a lesson? How do you usually deal with situations where people don’t understand your communication needs?

Let’s share some stories and strategies—it might just help someone else navigate similar situations!

Looking forward to hearing about your experiences! 😊

[댓글]
I was driving and talking to my friend and toddler in the backseat. I didn't hear the last word she said and started talking. She got mad at me telling me i ALWAYS interrupt her talking and questioned if I actually didn't hear her or if I just talked and didn't hear her because of it. That actually was my breaking point for the friendship because it showed me once again how she feels about my disabilities despite wanting support all the time from others herself.

What frustrates me the most in general is people not wanting to repeat themselves. Even if they know I have shitty hearing.

I always warn people that I need to see their face and read their lips to have a chance at understanding them. People tend to very quickly realize I am indeed more accurate if I read lips when things get bad.

I’ve been hoh since I was 8, im basically deaf in my right ear. Less than 10% word recognition, but I’m worse with male voices typically. So a lot of hearing men in my life have had a hard time understanding or believing that I can’t hear them but I can hear a woman better in the same environment. My family also accused me of ignoring them for a couple years before I failed my hearing test at school and it showed them there was a reason.

A story I have is when I was in high school I was staying at home alone with a friend for the night but my sister was supposed to come home late from work. She had a key but forgot it that day. My friend and I were asleep across the house and never heard her calls or her apparently banging on the door and ringing the bell. We were across the house but my friend is hearing and still didn’t hear. She had to go to my grandmas for the night and was upset when she finally got in the next morning. And I felt such crazy guilt but couldn’t have done anything. 

I have so many stories I could pull from. Bullying that was worsened because they knew I couldn’t hear them, also doing the same thing to my bf once that I did with my sister, etc. But glad to be hopefully getting cochlears soon and also to be in a place where I’ve accommodated myself better and have people around me at least trying to understand.

My only strategy as a hard of hearing person is just accepting that I can't hear the person talking so I will not try to communicate unless they actually put in the effort to make sure I hear them. I find it's easier for them to realize I'm not hearing them than for me to ask ""what? Huh? Can you say that again?"" a thousand times. Despite telling them that I'm hard of hearing a lot, most of them forget so I just have to remind them by not interacting until they actually make it so I can hear them.

Miscommunication is mostly a problem when we’re expected to hear normally. To be really clear about exactly what the limitations are and suggesting changes that make communication work better are good strategies.

my bf thinks if he talks loudly into my ear (without my hearing aids) that i’ll hear him…like babe…the ears don’t work…

For me it’s trying to explain to people that there are SO MANY VARIABLES that can make me not hear them or not understand them. Whether I’m wearing my hearing aids or not. 

It’s background, ambient noise, echo, frequency, pitch, tone. Sometimes I get feedback whine in my hearing aids. Sometimes my hearing aids suddenly decide to auto-change modes for no reason at all!  When this happens during a conversation, I’m lost. 

But everyone seems to think it’s just a VOLUME issue. It’s not. 

Some people mumble. Some people don’t enunciate clearly. Some people simply have a voice in a register that I just cannot hear for some reason. If you are looking away from me, that’s a double whammy. I cannot hear you as well PLUS I lose any context of facial expressions and lip reading. 
Trying to convince people that I’m not ignoring them gets tiring.",2024-12-03 09:24:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1h5jloo/whats_the_most_frustrating_thing_about/
1h58t9n,hardofhearing,Bluetooth transmitters that work with Phonak hearing aids?,"I've been shopping around for a bluetooth transmitter that will work well and work reliably with my Phonak hearing aids.

I reallyw want something I can plug into my PC so it can transmit the sound to my aids, instead of relying on external speakers.

Problem is, I've already tried a bunch out and they all either failed to work or worked improperly (sound cutting out at random intervals, which is distracting and annoying).

Can anyone recommend a bluetooth transmitter that just works?

[댓글]
I do not have a recommendation for a bluetooth transmitter, but Phonak hearing aids are quirky. Here is my experience:

My Phonak hearing aids must be turned on AFTER the paired bluetooth device that is sending the sound.

e.g.  If the phone is turned on after being off, the hearing aids wont connect until the hearing aids are powered off and then powered back on. 

After cycling the power on the Phonak  hearing aids, they work fine with the bluetooth on my phone, or my PC, or any other paired device.

What model?  I've had issues with MS Teams and turns out, it isn't a transmitter issue but a driver issue.  Using MS Teams in the browser instead of the app fixed it...  I'm on Naidas.  Also VERY important to not use the hands-free device!

I’ve used a Phonak Compilot before, I believe it would work for something like that

Roger Mic! I love mine. I have a Phonak Sky Link HA and Advanced Bionics M90 CI, and the Roger Mic works beautifully with my devices.

1h533ed,hardofhearing,Best Comfortable Headphones for Hearing Impaired Senior (low tech) for Family TV,"UPDATE: Based on another thread asking a similar question, I'm going to start with the Insignia NS-HAWHP2 RF Wireless Over the Ear Headphones. RF is kind of dated but it's simple tech that I think they could figure out since I don't live nearby to help (ex. they probably wouldn't know how to pair Bluetooth, we're talking very low tech). I may also consider getting a ZVOX sound bar as well. 

Looking for the best comfortable headphones for a low tech senior family member. a great deal (maybe Cyber Monday) on headphones that could be used on the family TV for a senior who uses hearing aids would be nice (you can DM models if you don't want to post). We'd like to still have the TV audio play so everyone else can hear it but headphones for the family member that misses a lot even with subtitles (these always seem bad with live TV or news). What's also very important is the voice be emphasized over the background music/noise as I think some headphones do this. If it makes any difference the TV is Toshiba (model 43LF621U19). Thsnks!

Why headphones specifically? What level of technology are their hearing aids? Do they have Bluetooth? I have Phonak hearing aids, and phonak Roger TV connector is a way to stream audio directly to your hearing aid. i've found it immensely beneficial for understanding dialogue. The only set up needed is adjusting tv audio outputs (I have an optical cable splitter, with one cable going to my soundbar, and 1 going to the Roger connector), and an initial pairing of the hearing aid.

Otherwise I don't have to press any buttons or additional settings, just turn my TV on and my hearing aid auto connects.

“Or does it come back eventually?” no one here can really answer that with any certainty. We have no idea what your ear looks like.

Maybe bone conduction headphones?

If you play music through an app with a good equalizer, you can selectively boost the volume at different frequency ranges to approximate your hearing prescription. 

But if your hearing loss is serious or worse, you're still going to need to make it pretty loud to be heard in the shower.

I haven't tried them yet, but I have seen headphone headbands for sale - looks like they connect via Bluetooth and lay flat against the head for side sleepers.

1h4eh0g,hardofhearing,"Single-ear hearing loss, but ENT doesn't agree","For approximately one year, my left ear has felt fullness and has had minor hearing loss (hard to put a value on it, but maybe 5-10%; ""vibrates"" less and in frequency test shows very weak hearing in the 5k-6k range and 7k-8k range; my best guess based on my symptoms is that it's conductive as opposed to sensorineural). It regularly feels itchy and has small amounts of fluid coming out of it fairly regularly.

I've learned to face him when I talk. To enunciate. To tap his shoulder for attention. To reduce background noise. Despite these efforts, he still has a tough time hearing/processingy my side of communication. He does wear hearing aides. 

Thanks in advance for being so open about your hearing loss and teaching the people in your lives how to be inclusive.

[deleted]

I'm ADHD as well as HoH. I attribute my wanting to talk a lot to the ADHD aspect and not so much the fact that I can't hear well. 

BUT, I will say that because of my hearing loss, I am less talkative with people I don't know well. Once I know someone well and I trust them to not judge, that's when my chattier side comes out. So, consider this a good thing?

He might just be a talkative person, lol. It could have something to do with his hearing loss, it could not. I don't think it matters. If it bothers you, talk to him about it.

What's a hearing number and how do you find out what it is?

I am a loud, talkative person. That was true before I lost my hearing. I think they're probably just a naturally talkative person who also happens to be HoH.

With bad enough hearing loss, it can be hard to do things very differently. If you just quiet or ask for people to repeat several times and then still have to write what they say down, that just wouldn’t work. So even if the coping mechanism is bad, there kind of are few alternatives to guessing what people say and to talk yourself. It takes a lot of social skills to navigate this. People often become upset there is a communication barrier no matter what we do, since we can’t really make the hearing normal. We often wonder ourselves what is personality and what is hearing loss. Meeting other HoH helps us to understand ourselves better, and improve how we talk about our hearing loss. Personally, I think people should learn sign language even with smaller losses. It just shows us how real communication can be when it’s effortless.

I appreciate everyone sharing your thoughts. Thank you.

Do learn sign language too. We will always be at an disadvantage when listening, and you need something that will allow you to feel that efficient communication is possible. Language learning is always good for us, and in the case of hearing loss, it’s should be obvious to learn to sign. Not instead of hearing aids and Cis, but as a supplement to them.

That sucks. I had a hearing test 2 years apart and it also got worse for no explainable reason.

I’d also love to know if there’s a tool or service you’ve found that actually works well. Let’s share tips and ideas for making phone communication easier!

[댓글]
Getting people to understand that phone doesn’t work?

I don’t know why HoH accept phone calls at all, but I had enough when I lost a considerable amount of money, because I wanted to be nice and finally gave up on getting the ban to see me in person when buying an apartment. The bank had centralized their service for mortgages and only handled such requests over phone. Of course there was a misunderstanding, and of course I was upset about it. After that, I decided I had the right to refuse phone.

CaptionCall is a free app in the US. All of your calls are transcribed in real time. It works great and their support is really good too.

For me, spoken conversation on a phone whether through the speaker or the Bluetooth hearing aids is just clarity and miscommunication, frustration...

Every single person speaks differently and I don't mean accents though that's a big one. I mean volume, pitch, enunciation, and speed. Breathy static, background noise, fuzzy sound... I hate making calls now.

I have tried just about every dang auto caption option on my phone and several apps that are free... But most of those are automated and I just sorta laugh because they 'hear' like a me (a deaf/hoh person). The automatic gets just as confused by the same things i do, frequently gets words wrong, misses some...

In the end I have two faulty inputs, audio and visual.

For me, the most frustrating part is having to rely on a third party to facilitate the conversation. It feels like it takes away from the flow of communication. I’ve been using the free captioning app [Nagish](https://getapp.nagish.com/7Z9B/eojo3uc6) for phone calls and in-person conversations, and it's been great.

IMO, phone tree me is are ok, captions work well with them. 

My biggest frustration is when I’m using an IP relay and the worker at the bank/hospital/clinic needs to speak to me to verify my identity. Or they talk to the relay operator about me, “please tell [my name] that he needs to …”

My problem is that I can hear well on the phone if my phone Bluetooth actually works but because it makes my voice on the other end of the call muffled and amplifies literally every sound around me, I have to talk on speaker which makes it nearly impossible

Not a 100% solution, but could be helpful. This website gives you a transcript and a summary of IVR messages.

1h1evet,hardofhearing,Dizzy after surgery ,"So a little background. I’m completely deaf in my left year and wear a hearing aide in my right ear. (Since I was 5 years old, now almost 40) I just had bunion surgery on my right foot and ever since then, my hearing has been off. Everything is loud and echo-y. I’m missing out on more conversations, and a couple of days ago I would randomly get dizzy and lightheaded. This morning was the first day, I woke up so dizzy I ended up throwing up. Something is off with my ears, I just know it. Has anyone else experienced sudden hearing loss and vertigo after a surgery? 

[댓글]
I’m really sorry that this isn’t specific to surgery on ears but both times I had surgery I vomited once I woke up. This time I was incredibly nauseous for days after my surgery and even threw up once when I was home. I think dizziness and nausea can be common after surgery but if you have concerns then reach out to your health care provider

Is this the first time you’ve had surgery? Or at least the first time not as a young child? (Only asking because this will help you know more ahead of time if you need future surgeries.) 

I’m EXTREMELY sensitive to anesthesia and unfortunately have had A LOT of surgeries. Every single time I am very nauseous post-op, struggle with balance (more than usual), and feel very “off.” For some people, myself included, feeling really off can last for many days. If you’re consistently feeling nauseous and/or vomiting, as well as struggling with your hearing, I’d definitely recommend contacting your surgeon’s office (or the hospital). They’ll have someone on-call who can assist you with post-op complications, and not just related to the surgery site. You could ask about orally-disintegrating anti-nausea meds, which are generally well tolerated, and will hopefully help with your nausea. If you’re able to tolerate liquids, staying hydrated will help flush any remaining anesthesia out of your body. 

Another thought… if you’re on strong pain meds (opioids, etc) those can also affect balance and the GI system, among other things. Talk to your doctor about switching to Tylenol &amp; Advil if those are safe for you, since they don’t typically make you loopy the way opioids do. (FWIW I can’t take opioids either because they make me horrifically nauseous and very, very dizzy. Like, room spinning, I can’t move without feeling like I’m gonna puke dizzy. Once opioids are out of my system I feel worlds better.)",2024-11-27 21:02:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1h1evet/dizzy_after_surgery/

And then forgot I had the water running. Woke up to a huge mess in my kitchen.

My dog was acting like something was happening and I kept assuring him that nothing was going on but he seemed sure someone was at the door. I got to the door and opened it while proclaiming “see no one is here” only to come face to face with my mom. Turns out the dog could hear my mom approach but I could. Still can’t forget the shocked look on her face at me abruptly swinging the door open as she reached for it hahaha

Honestly due to my type of hearing loss is primarily mishearing conversations as opposed to not hearing water running

When catching up with an acquaintance I hadn’t seen in years, I said, “That’s so nice” after she told me her dad had died. I thought she said she’d been to see her dad. I’m still cringing years later.

Due to my work, we do crisis intervention training (CIT) yearly. We work with actors that act as an individual experiencing a crisis (mental health, fight, whatever). 

One year was working with a guy who was upset and trying to figure out what was wrong. (Spoiler, he was off his meds) At one point, I was asking about his physical symptoms, and he said, ""I'm so hot."" I HEARD ""you're so hot""...

Let me tell you! These actors are amazing, and the dude didn't even hesitate to go down that road... Obviously, this crosses professional boundaries, so I tried to yell him it was inappropriate and redirect the conversation. But he kept going. It was a handful of back and forth before it got too deep, and I had to 'pause scenario' to gather my bearings. I didn't find out until the next day what he actually said.

the number of things I've left on the stove that totally boil over and make a mess and i never even hear it happening. also my sense of smell is horrible so i dont even smell anything right away either! 
(or on the flip side, i leave something going and all the water boils out and i burn the hell out of my pans)

I was walking home to the train after a 3-11 shift in a not so great neighborhood (chicago Austin and Lake green line stop) and a pair of cops pulled up on me screaming. Apparently they had been yelling at me to stop and they thought I had been ignoring them. It was January in Chicago and I took my ears out because the wind was so loud and I get sweaty in all my layers walking for blocks. 

They didn’t believe a word I said even though I had my scrubs and work ID on a lanyard around my neck, and the security guard at the front desk watched me leave like 3 minutes ago. They threw all my shit out of my bag and pockets on the ground in the snow and accused me of being there to buy drugs. It was so scary and awful. I couldn’t understand them well but I could read the body language loud and clear. 

It happened again like a week later and I switched to days, then switched facilities.

Walked in on someone in the bathroom at a public place.  I could see under the door enough to know the light was off, but I knocked anyway because it’s a habit… I obviously didn’t hear the response and walked in on a blind man mid-pee.

I was on mission trip, and we were helping at a daycare. It was really loud, kids and tv and everything. so basically a baby fell asleep on the floor, and this boy asks me, 
“should we wake up the baby, or let it (sigh. “it” is a human) sleep?” 😭 I heard 

“should we make a baby, and go to sleep?” 

i was like 13, and i was racking my brain for context clues, because surely, a 16 year old christian boy did not just say that to me. surely. i asked him to repeat himself, and I read his lips, and i was like “OOOHHHH” and I’m so glad i didn’t do anything different 😭

Numerous heated arguments with the wife over things she actually never said 😇

I was with my stepson checking into the kiosk for a campsite. The lady at the window asked what my ID number was and I got out my ID to hand to her since I don't know it off the top of my head. She said no your license number and I said idk so I got out of my car to look at my plate and see.  She said what are you doing, no what is your SITE number.  I felt like a fool.  There was a line of cars behind us trying to get checked in and I'm just a HOH dummy lol

When i was 10, I was hiking near a river, my dad and brother warned me not to go down 'that' path because it was super slippery.  

Not hearing, i went down the path and down on my face, teeth first, breaking my front tooth in half and putting a huge hole through my lip.  

Bleeding profusely in the car all i remember saying was, ""Don't tell mom!""

I have a cochlear implant in one year and a hearing aid in the other and I can go swimming with my CI but not my hearing aid. I was spending a week in Mexico and jumped in the pool with both devices on. I was lucky my hearing aid didn't get wet from the water and ran out of the pool to take it off.

When I take my hearing aids out, I do not hear anything. My brother was trying to reach me to tell me that my father had passed away and hospice. Thankfully I wasn’t sleeping great and picked up on the next attempts that he made.

Ugh, when I was in freshman year, we were doing a biology project. This girl in my class had kept repeating the name “Bingus” over and over again because it sounds funny. (It was a project where we had to make a poster on a genetic mutation for either animals or humans. The girl’s friend had named the cat on his poster “Bingus”) 

So I was on the other side of the room and the girl was talking pretty fast. Instead of “Bingus”, I had heard “hearing loss”. I was the only person in the room who was HoH, so I thought she was mocking me. 

The next day, I went up and “confronted” her about it. In the high school lobby. At a table full of people. She was rightfully confused and looked scared (I don’t blame her, as I do tend to talk loud when I’m feeling a strong emotion) I accused her of lying and walked away to the Student Support Center. I felt a feeling a dread as I was walking (probably because I severely misheard her 💀)  When I got there, I talked to the teacher about it and broke down crying over the whole situation. 

The girl got in trouble (in the principal’s office 💀) and later came into my Algebra class (during the 15 minute break period) with her friend and they explained the situation. It was so awkward 😭.",2024-11-27 15:48:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1h17d7e/whats_the_most_facepalming_thing_youve_done_due/
1h0tmg5,hardofhearing,Understanding my son’s hearing,"I’ll keep my story brief and thanks so much to anyone who chimes in. My daughter is 3 ever since she was little she kind of would breathe like a pug and hold her breath for a bit between breaths. Let the doctors know and they were never concerned fast forward to a little bit of a speech delay not passing a hearing test. We think her tonsils are too big and that’s somehow effecting hearing. 

I was wondering if someone could help me decipher her chart

[댓글]
Was the interpretation of the audiogram not something you've discussed with your doctor? Were they not concerned the second time around? The first audiogram from September indicates a very mild loss, but November indicates her hearing reaching moderate hearing loss levels in her right ear. Audiograms can certainly be a little less accurate with younger children, but this jump over the course of two months seems a bit concerning.

Find another ENT.

His bone conduction score is not perfect, but good enough to be in the normal range.   So he has a mild conductive loss.   Common causes (I am not a medical professional - seek medical pro advice) can include 1) broken or scarred ear drums. 2) middle ear effusion (filled with liquid due to infection or eustachian tube congestion  or blockage) 3) damage to tiny bones in middle ear


Find another ent provider.  This could be a temporary issue that needs medical attention before it worsens.

That’s some not too good hearing right there. Check in with your ENT about tonsils and overall mess round there :)

I have all too much personal experience as a kid with similar diagnoses.  Did they also perform a tympanogram or just the haring test?  That's a thing they put in the ear, seal it, and give it a momentary puff of pressure.  That measures eardrum function and would tell you a lot in terms of physical problems.

Getting a highly accurate test on kids is tough, but there's a significant reduction in hearing in two months if the test is legit and that can indicate a physical problem with the middle ear-- pressure, fluid or too little pressure (causing a vacuum) behind the eardrum.  All are painful and they're generally something that can be addressed medically through medicine or simple surgery.  They can also lead to more problems if not treated and airway constriction from tonsil problems is a real problem with things like getting good quality sleep.  (In the meantime don't scold her for breathing through her mouth.)  Some doctors now are very averse to removing tonsils, but if it's necessary the earlier it's done the faster the recovery.

I'm concerned that you can't get into an ENT until February, but getting as much of the additional information that you can now is only helpful if you can get into a GP doctor sooner.  Audiograms tell you a lot but they're not the whole set of diagnostic tools that doctors have for this sort of thing.  An ENT is the best option, but getting eyeballs on eardrums and tonsils would help.

I would also note (as a person who had their first ear surgery at age 3) that this is the point when their brains are learning to interpret sound and getting this fixed sooner rather than later is helpful if it is something that can be treated.

All of this is a long winded way of saying that you have a lot of stuff to work on first to address or rule out before hearing aids.  If they can detect and fix middle ear problems early she may not need hearing aids.  My doctors back in the olden days of the 1900s couldn't save all of my hearing but saved enough to put off hearing aids until I was in middle age.  That's a small victory and technology has advanced significantly since then.  If she does need hearing aids, then try to find a pediatric hearing aid specialist and again-- getting hearing aids if necessary sooner rather than later is helpful to a kid so they can start hearing and processing sounds that most people take for granted.

Can you keep calling and checking for cancellations? Do they have you on a wait list for any they may have? Having a son with multiple specialists, I've come to realize that often the urgency has to come from our side to make sure they get the care they need when they need it. I've had to get more comfortable being pushy and not feeling bad about it, which has been a challenge but worth it to make sure he's getting what he needs.",2024-11-27 02:19:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1h0tmg5/understanding_my_sons_hearing/

Uh... do you even know your hearing curve? A CI isnt a casual Aspirine pill,but a highly invasive procedure which will permanently alter your body and may not be satisfactory if you aren't ready and well informed. It scertainly not just prescribed like headache pills.

A CI is an actual last resort of you have serious trouble dealing with your daily life even with hearing aids. Just prescicribing it on the basis of a pure tone audiometry seems kind of sleazy. Do keep in mind CIs are very expensive and highly profitable to the surgeon.

Things like whistling, toddler screaming, door squeaking, and shrieking have now started making me disoriented and painful. 

Its suspected I have type II incomplete partition, parts of my cochlea are abnormal or underdeveloped. Does anyone have any experiences with this? I’m looking into CI’s and wondering if those have been any help

Hi there, I’ve been HoH since birth as well and it’s hereditary. So I have progressive cookie bite hearing. My high pitches only are 20db loss but my lowest is about 65 at middle speech.

Just know you’re not alone, I personally wouldn’t get a CI because I’d rather not hear at all than deal with the robotic sounds it comes into. Then again my dad’s side of the family all has this hearing loss so we know how to work with each other. 

I’m also a teacher by trade so I do need to wear my hearing aids when I’m working but I can deal if it’s just during the day and I know to take them out when I get home

1gywk3s,hardofhearing,Needing advice for HoH husband,"My husband is hard of hearing. I'm not sure if this stems from his hearing loss, but he has a very hard time following conversations with a group of more than 3 people. I already talk at a very fast pace, and when I'm around other people, it probably is worse. That being said, he gets really upset because he feels left out of conversations. He's usually really quiet anyways, and rarely talks, which I'm attributing to his hearing loss. 

How can I help him feel more included in conversations with a group of people? 

[댓글]
If he has hearing aids he needs to make sure they’re correctly adjusted. You can help by making sure you face him when you talk and you don’t rush your speech or talk quietly

It’s not just the number of people, it’s all the noise that you need to work through when dining out. Make sure your party knows to face your husband and not cover your face. Context matters and sorting out words with other meanings are challenging. Good luck and keep up the good work

You most likely need to be his ears also to some extent. And maybe help build his confidence to advocate for himself when he wants someone to repeat something. Let everyone know “never mind” is not a sufficient response if he does do that. You and whoever you’re with also should try to speak one at a time as much as you can.

Get an appointment for a hearing test with a local audiologist?  Often benefits will cover a good chunk of the cost of hearing aids.  You didn't mention if he's already been in but that's the first step to his solution

You need to ask him what you can do to make him feel more included.

When choosing where to sit, usually best for the HOH person to have a wall behind them, so HA's don't pickup unwanted background noise.  Although modern HA's are good you can help them out further! 

If got a better side than the other eg my right side is better than my left I'll sit on the left of people / corner seat and have people to my right / in front of me.

If HOH lip reads make sure the other people don't have excess light behind them eg they have a bright window behind them / bright tv etc as this casts shadows.

Depending on the brand you can get remote mics either for the table or on a lanyard, if Made for iPhone HA's eg Oticon you can use the live listen feature - the mic on the phone can be used as a remote mic.

I feel for him. That’s me in my marriage. Big groups, loud spaces, are really hard, even with my hearing aids. The sound from all directions, overlapping conversations, it scrambles my brain and I tend to tune out. A few tips: strategic placement. At the end of a long dinner table I only have to focus on a couple of conversation partners. That’s good. In the middle of the table I’m toast. In a cocktail party environment, I’m good if I have just a few folks to talk with while the others have their chats. But if the whole group is talking as a unit—one big conversation—I just can’t track it or enjoy it. So: if your friends are the caring sort, sharing a bit of this with them might encourage at least some of them to tune into your guy’s plight. It has helped with my friends.

I like using a transcription app for meetings, that could help him be able to follow. Google translate has a good transcription feature I use often

Have you looked at subtitling glasses like https://xrai.glass? Full disclosure I am the founder, but I created these originally for my granddad who lost his hearing. They're particularly useful in situations where individuals struggle with hearing aids. The app is free to try!

My husband helps me follow the conversation by repeating what I miss. I think from us just being together for almost 20 years, he knows my face expressions enough to know I’m not following the conversation as I should. He will right away repeat what was said or ask me did I hear what was said. If I didn’t, he’d repeat it. So, if you notice your husband looks confused, ask him what he heard last. That way you know where he got lost in the convo and catch him up to speed. The crowd my husband and I hang out with know I can’t hear well and wait for him to fill me in. They also face me, clearly pronounce words, and will repeat what they said as well if I need it. You could try doing this with your husband. Us HoH tend to fall behind in the convo easily when it’s fast. As someone else mentioned above, make sure your husband is seated with his back to a wall facing everyone in the group so he can see everyone clearly. Our back to the wall helps drown out other sounds. Try to sit away from speakers and the kitchen. I rely on reading lips when I get lost also in conversation. Not sure if your husband has built up this skill yet, but it helps. It takes a while to have a system that works for you both, and a lot of frustration, but don’t give up.

Can you have more gatherings at someone’s home? Going to restaurants or food courts is bad for me even with just my wife. Add in a whole group of people and I’m SOL. I do much better in smaller groups or in someone’s home (or our home) where I know the background noise will be minimal. 

Are you guys into board games? If so, it’s easy to be included in a game everyone is playing. Plus, there are usually written instructions so he can read them for extra clarity. You can also take turns talking so he can look directly at whomever is speaking.

Don't be in a group of people if he is around.  

Also see if his phone does captioning.  Samsung Ultras and Pixel phones comes to mind. 

I don't do groups. At all.  It isn't worth the trouble.

If you absolutely have to have him in a group, make sure he is in the middle of the group, and not the either end.

Please google ""real ear measurements (REMs)"" ... You'll want to make sure the audiologist or HIS runs this test and knows what they are doing. Dr Cliff has a bunch of videos showing what you should expect to see on the screen if your provider knows what they are doing. Without REMs, the provider is just guessing, and they might also miss something critical like the hearing aid underperforming due to moisture/wax/corrision, etc. If the REMs are perfect and your husband still struggles, you might want to consider asking your provider about a remote microphone that he can point at (or place near) people he wants to hear. Upgrading hearing aids might also be a good option. The new phonak sphere is helping a lot of people. If his hearing loss is severe to profound, cochlear implants might also be an option.

Hey, seems like you've got some great advice. I just wanted to put in my 2 cents as someone who is looking at getting their first set of hearing aids. The tech is so advanced, especially for speech clarity in noise settings, and those that track who is speaking and amplifies that persons voice.... maybe your husband may find improvement in one of these newer models. Also accessories like small remote mics that he can subtly point to the person who is talking for further amplification.

Corner booth or near a wall, minimize music or use slow/classical in low volume, clarity not volume when it comes to speech - have the group pretend they're trying out to be vocal coaches or news announcers emphasize k, t, g, ch, s and such since they're harder to hear. 

It's actually rude to have multiple conversations at a time since it implies the other concurrent conversations are boring or not important.

One at a time or emphasize listening as the important part of the conversation, not being the center of the attention.

Strategies for the conversation understanding:

Use phone to type out subject - just knowing what's being talked about is helpful in understanding context.

This is what I use on a daily basis - it's approximate not accurate on transcription.

If you have Google Pixel, there's live transcribe
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.audio.hearing.visualization.accessibility.scribe

Another way is using YouTube live over phone broadcast and the other receiving and using auto caption for it.

Google docs has a voice to text transcribe for accessibility reasons

I completely get it. As someone who share similar frustrations in group settings with hearing loss, I've found Nagish's [free live transcribe](https://nagish.com/live-transcribe) to be very useful for in-person group conversations. It picks up on people's conversations and transcribes them into captions for the person to read and engage.

Last year, i bought an cheap but powerful headphones that can sound up to 117dB, and like any basshead, i cranked the volume to between 65-85% with bass boosted songs thinking it wasn't sounding really loud. I was wrong. I was using them at 90/105dB for some minutes per day thinking it was below 85dB only because i didn't feel any pain. Even though i experienced some ""fullness"" and feeling liquid moving on my ears just some seconds after using the headphones loud, i ignored that, then, some months later, i got an 1500hz oscillating tinnitus on my both ears (1450-1550hz) and 6000hz tinnitus exclusive to my right ear,and I noticed that i was damaging my ears, but it was too late. I only exposed my ears to that hell for 6 months. Now, bass sounds are PAINFUL to my ears, even if BASS is at 70dB it will cause pain, and the worst thing, is that i hear bass with a dial tone, like other tone sounding among sounds in 38-400hz range. If i remember, my hearing was good, but now i feel like an ""emptiness"", on supermarkets i only hear the voices and not AC too much anymore. I struggle a bit hearing bass also. Some months ago i used to hear up to 18.5KHZ without any issues but now my left ear cant hear anything above 17khz and my right ear cant hear above 18.2khz, i almost don't expose myself anymore to loud sounds, but my high pitched and low pitched hearing is getting worse.

What did your audiologist say about treating your tinnitus?

I had the exact same issue with you. To this day, no answers. My theory is due to nerves dying. It is just a theory.

I don't think detecting dial tone is that difficult at all. Nor is it accurate. The frequency could have been detected by other active haircells in the ear and not neccessarily the ones damaged.

I even think the whole tonal structure of the cohclear is a farce and fake science.
The cohclear functions as one unit and all the hairs manages all frequencies. Some just better adapt by certain frequencies.

Let's say you damaged your low frequency, your high frequency haircell would've been recruited to help you detect it. Thus sounding weird? 

Maybe that is what happened. Medicine haven't progress at all in a few decades now. We are still in the dark ages regarding these. Doctors useless when all the information and research papers are freely available online for your own diagnosis.

Doctors just want your money.

My name is Gabriela Barrios. I’m a college student at Georgia State University, and I’m currently working on a project focused on understanding the unique educational experiences of deaf students. I believe that the best way to learn is to hear directly from those with hands-on experience. I’m looking to interview educators who have worked with or currently teach deaf students to better understand challenges you’ve faced in the classroom, strategies you find most effective, teaching styles you’ve developed, etc. I’m also looking to interview students as well to better understand their personal experience in academia, the specific challenges they face, and any other personal anecdotes. 

If you’re open to sharing your experiences, please comment below or send me a private message. We can set up a time that works for you to chat—whether via email, video call, or even here in the group. Being an educator/student is not a requirement, I value anyone’s opinion on this matter and would love to include that as well.

Your stories and insights could greatly impact fostering awareness and improving education for deaf students. Thank you for your time and for considering sharing your experiences!

1gxwsc8,hardofhearing,Sudden hearing loss in right ear after confluence of a migraine and a viral infection ,"Hi everyone,

I lost total hearing in my right ear at the same time as a migraine. I (maybe stupidly) did not want to go into the ER with a migraine even though the hearing loss was concerning. I woke up the next day and felt anxious all day and like my ear was full but had some hearing. It wasn't until Monday came around where that feeling wasn't getting better and in fact got worse (plus new tinnitus) that I went to an Urgent Care. 

I got a rudimentary hearing test and then they called the oncall ENT who put me on high dose oral steroids. I then needed an audiologist appt who told me I have mild hearing loss. 

With the audiologist test (which I frustratingly have no idea how to interpret) I went to the ENT that prescribed me the steroids and they told me I have a 30% chance of getting my hearing back but the combination of the migraine and virus probably permananetly damaged my ear. 

Anyway all that to say I am struggling with this and I keep having panic attacks about the tinnitus and hearing loss feeling. It doesn't feel like I thought it would as a hearing person. I feel like I can hear but I can't ascertain where sounds are coming from. This disorients me and I have fallen 3 times since Friday. I keep having massive panic attacks and have been wearing an ear plug in my right ear to pretend it's normal. I don't know why that helps but it does.

I don't know why I'm writing this post but I feel very scared and lost. I'm struggling in places I especially have to concentrate on sound such as school (I'm a grad student). This is all extremely new too, only a week. I don't even know if this will be permanent. I'm just very scared. 

Any helpful tips or advice for someone with new hearing loss?

1gwffzi,hardofhearing,Otosclerosis - Valid concern or false hope?,"https://preview.redd.it/w062dircz82e1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c97ebbb1427611e70eff58b3a97a8506e353553

Hi everyone.  
(I already made a new appointment with my ENT, but it's a month away)

  
As the title suggests, ***I*** have the suspiscion that I might have otoscleroris.  
My hearing loss was first diagnosed in my early 20s and started very mild. I didn't bother getting hearing aids until I was 25/26. I am now 32. But the thing that angered me the most was and for now still is, that noone could tell me WHY it happened. All the ENTs I saw over the years always did the basic checkup. Just looking into my ear and telling me everything looks ok. No physical damage, no unusual amount of earwax and so on. I also don't remember ever having some kind of ear infection, especially not on both sides. But none of them bothered to do or suggest further checkups. Even though the progression of my hearing loss always triggered the same reaction, from ENT and audiologist alike: ""It doesn't get worse THAT quickly...OH!""That's when they see the updated results. Like I said, the ""not knowing why"" part is what bothers me the most. I kept looking for clues, ideas, reasons. So just to mess around, I downloaded the Medical Diagnosis App ""ADA"" and put in all of my symptoms...and Otosclerosis showed up. Prior to that, I never heard of it. But the deeper I dug, the checkboxed got ticked: 

* most common between the ages of 20 and 40 - Check
* constant tinnitus - Check
* slow but constantly progressing hearing loss - Check
* the [Carhart Notch](https://www.entlecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rahul-Bagla-ENT-Online-textbook-GIMS-Carharts-notch-otosclerosis-768x576.jpg) \- Maybe Check, my left ear looks like it
* Mumps is suspected to be a cause for it - Check, but it seems to be a rather common childhood illness

There are of course other things, that don't apply or I can't tell, like hearing better in loud enviroments, since it's been a long time since I actually went through my everyday life without my hearing aids. 

Now, if you wonder, why I consider this a hope for my situation. Otosclerosis can appearantly (at least partially) be fixed with surgery. I have very mixed emotions right now, because it feels like, I finally have an answer, though maybe I am just reaching and creating false hope for myself, and just got unlucky in life. Who knows, only time will tell.

But I would really like some feedback. Maybe some of you actually had otosclerosis. Are there other signs, that would indicate it more clearly? Did you also self-diagnose or did you get a complete check-up since your hearing loss started?",2024-11-21 12:46:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gwffzi/otosclerosis_valid_concern_or_false_hope/
1gvw8cu,hardofhearing,Cookie bite with tinnitus and hyperacusis? Anyone else have this?,"I just got my hearing tested yesterday to rule out auditory processing issues. I've been getting tested for a whole mess of things, because I avoided doctors in my 30s and just am tired of living with my various issues.

Well, I thought I might have a combo of both, but my hearing loss is worse than I thought, mild-moderate cookie bite. My worst is dead center at 50. I have trouble with understanding speech, either from not paying attention enough or just struggling to hear, probably a combo. The audiology chart was super helpful in my understanding of why I have the sound-related challenges that I do. 

High-pitched sounds drive me crazy. I actually cringe and want to cover my ears, which is embarrassing in public. It spikes my anxiety up to be out in public, say in the city on a humid day where everyone's breaks are squeaking. The doors in the audiology department had bad squeaks and they definitely noted that it was painful for me. 

My tinnitus has been getting worse at about the same rate as the hyperacusis. They audiologist and doctor both didn't think there's anything to do about the hyperacusis and that a hearing aid would help me hear but might make the hyperacusis worse. I kind of think they're missing a good chunk of knowledge on the topic, but I'm wondering if anyone else hear has tried to get this sort of thing improved? 

Either way, I'm going to try getting prescription hearing aids through my insurance, because I can tell that straining to hear and understand speech makes me tired. Even the hearing test was tiring, and I have a lot of fatigue. ",2024-11-20 18:21:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gvw8cu/cookie_bite_with_tinnitus_and_hyperacusis_anyone/

1gud0g8,hardofhearing,Headphones,"Hello, does anyone know any good headphones that I could wear over my hearing aids to listen to music?

[댓글]
Use Bluetooth connection instead.

I strongly recommend only getting hearing aids that have both Bluetooth and t-coil. You need the connectivity, and using headphones is worse and hard to get comfortable.

For context, Im 35 years old and have worn hearing aids for 31 years. I have a moderate serve hearing loss.

I’ve been an avid music lover my entire life. In 2012 a music industry friend gave me a pair of over the ear noise cancellation headphones and it changed my life. 

I was able to hear details in songs I’ve never heard before. It fully enhanced my love for music in a way that I never thought was possible. 

The downside, is I still take my hearing aids out to listen, it just all works better this way imo. 


I currently have  a pair of Bowers and Wilkins Px 7S2, and there’s a nice chamber in the case that I stick my hearing aids in. 

Alternatively, I travel a lot and I like to listen to music but often miss the announcements. I thought about getting the new Apple AirPods that you can program your hearing loss into, to act as a stand in when I need to hear things while listening to music. 

Hope this helps :)",2024-11-18 19:20:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gud0g8/headphones/

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this!

All (or most? Not sure if there are any exceptions?) people with hearing loss struggle to hear when there is background noise. I have severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and the worst environment for me is a crowded party or restaurant. Everything is muffled and indistinct. 

I wouldn’t exactly say I can’t hear my own voice, but it sounds different depending on whether I’m wearing my hearing aids, which I’ve heard is because with hearing aids you’re hearing your voice closer to how others hear it. However, there are some sounds I can make but not hear, like shushing.

Personally, I would strongly recommend you see a neurologist and potentially another ENT for a second opinion. Even if the audiogram comes out normal, something is going on!",2024-11-18 14:53:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gu6hz7/hearing_in_background_noise/

1gtdflb,hardofhearing,Do these results can affect me that bad?,"Okay, okay, I now. This is an online test, but I live in a country where health care is ridiculesly expensive (even with a normal insurance which I have). So before I go to my home country to a doctor, I made some online tests, just to calm myself down a bit.

But I am kinda freaked out right now. I have a lot of difficulty understanding people in this country. They speak a strong dialect, which is challanging to everyone who is not from here, but i straggle even with lighter dialects or fast speech. But here is the strange part: if i listen to anyting on YouTube or watch a movie, I understand the language perfectly. If I read a book, I have zero problems to understand it. But if someone asks something in a shop, I have to ask them to repeat. I never understand loudspeakers in supermarkets, train stations, aerports etc.
The same goes with English. I listen to English videos all day, but this weekend we went to trip, and I understood nothing from the loudspeaker on the bus. My partner did. I felt so stupid. I actually feel stupid all the time... 

After the bus incident I started to pay attention on my partners speech. (We communicate on our mother thong.) I realised, I dont understand him eather clearly, I am just pretty good at guessing. I have no idea when all this started. In my home country I never recognised this. The only thing that alwasy bothered me, that it doesn't matter, how much i practice my listening skills, I am alwasy shitty in any forgein languages in a face to face situation. (I have 2 language degrees btw. The listening is always played in max. volume.) This is devastating.

You’re hearing is pretty normal. I was told anything from 0-20 is considered within range. Youre basically in that area with some very slight drops. Honestly your graphs are confusing and varied which doesn’t help. Remember conducting your own hearing test online like you did increases the chance of user error so take the results with a shaker of salt.

I agree with what fallspector has said, there might be some very mild hearing loss, but it's hard to gauge with an online test.


I've done formal tests with an ENT, but [here are my online hearing test results](https://imgur.com/a/R6x97ry) in case you'd like to compare. I frequently do online tests to see if there are any recent/major changes in my hearing. 


The blue line is my left ear, which shows normal hearing. The red line is my right ear, which shows moderate hearing loss.



For my online tests, I use an app called Hearing Test that's made by e-audiologia.pl. When doing the test, I used noise-cancelling over-ear headphones. On the app, I go through each beeping sound until I cannot hear it anymore, then backtrack to where it's barely audible.

Yours is in normal range. But indeed a ""true test"" you can figure out the true thing. Do you live in Europe?

Apart from what everyone else is saying, I’d like to add something as someone with moderate hearing loss. 

I see a lot of posts with people having anxiety about getting their hearing tested, or in your case what their results mean. 

Obviously, understanding medical examination results is super important, and trust me, I live every day suffering with this disability and it truly sucks. 

But I think it’s crucial to remember that these results don’t change your hearing! You already hear that way. The results or the meaning won’t make you hear worse or better.",2024-11-17 13:22:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gtdflb/do_these_results_can_affect_me_that_bad/
1gt15re,hardofhearing,Netflix subtitles- important!,"

[댓글]
I always love it when there are hard coded subs for foreign language translations and they put the ""speaking foreign language"" directly over the hard coded subs for the exact same duration.

What about when the youtuber curses uncensored but the captions are all [ ] or whatever? 💀

I didn't know this despite using them on everything! Foreign films/shows translated to English are the worst. Can't read the lips of subtitles!

Unfortunately, that law is not in Australia. This led to our streaming services not even having subtitles for the first few years, then horrendously formatted ones later.

American Google Play movies always have subtitles, but the exact same movie on Australian Google play.. nope.

And now many movies that come out on Prime Video (Australian Prime Tv) don't have subtitles either. 

I pay for every streaming service I can, bought movies etc and I still run into this. They make it really hard to watch movies without pirating lol

Sidenote - subtitle websites were also among the first to be banned by the Australian Government (eg opensubtitles.org couldn't be used without a vpn) because they're for illegal services???

I noticed this and it really annoys me because I can usually hear it's wrong but I don't know what they said. I'm about to rebuy netflix actually because the standard with Ads is quite affordable. Luckily I don't need captions too often.

Prime Video in the UK is far worse 90% of content literally has no subtitles!

Not entirely sure this is true. If we're claiming this, do we have the exact regulation to cite?

For the record, the first one is often motivated by fast or overlapping dialogue. Subtitles can't be over a certain speed or some viewers can't keep up, so they sometimes need to summarize while retaining meaning - ""Holy crap I'm so freaking out right now"" and ""I'm freaking out"" have basically the same meaning but one takes half as long to read as the other.

1gsdj4r,hardofhearing,Hearing aid suggestions ,"So I learned during Covid that I’m hard of hearing, got the official hearing test done with a doctor who confirmed it. Before that we always just joked that we all had “selective” hearing or just weren’t paying attention, but with everyone wearing masks I realized how much I leaned on lip reading to hear people. So I went on Amazon because I was told that my hearing is bad enough to warrant hearing aids but not enough to spend thousands of dollars per ear. Well the first pair I got had good reviews but it was like having tiny echoing microphones in my ears and I couldn’t wear both at the same time or they acted more like ear plugs and blocked a lot of sounds. My poor coworker has a very soft voice and it constantly blocked her voice and I wasn’t able to wear them around her. 

I work in a clinical setting, need to be able to answer phones, talk face to face with clients, all with lots of loud background noise. Am I asking for too much? Am I going to have to go with the expensive options? Anybody happen to have some suggestions? I’ve been going without for over a year but my husband and coworkers are getting increasingly frustrated with my hearing.

Is Costco an option in your region? Because while they are still expensive, they cost 1/3 what you pay at an audiologist, and they are solid, name brand hearing aids.

So a couple of things you could try. 
Check your state's department of labor, or accessibility services, they will often have special loans/programs/loaners that you can use. 
Do you have insurance? If you see a audiologist, you could see if they work with your insurance to get HA's (more and more insurances are starting to cover a pair every 3-5 years). 

What state are you in? Maybe I can share some resources. (You can DM me if you want)

Sorry to be blunt but there is no cure. You can get hearing aids but it’s not a cure, it’s a tool. Go to an ENT doctor or an audiologist to check your hearing and if necessary they (audiologist) will prescribe hearing aids

I'm sorry for being so blunt but, there is no cure for hearing loss, and no way to slow it down.

hearing aids are a tool/treatment to help your hearing.

Have you been to an ENT doctor? It seems like you might need a hearing test done, to determine what frequencies you're struggling to hear. The ENT will also prescribe you the right hearing aids for you and help you program them based on your level of hearing loss.

You will also find out why you have hearing loss so early on, my guess is genetics.


I had an accident 2 years ago that busted my eardrums and broke my 2 mastoid bones, found out later, when my hearing wasn't getting better that I had pretty severe otosclerosis in both ears.

My ENT and audiologist are truly a godsend, talking me through everything and helping find what is best for me.

The only time hearing might be restored is for sudden hearing loss. This is a medical emergency and there can be a positive outcome if treated quickly but can become permanent if not.

It’s treatable through hearing aids but there is no cure. I have sensorineural hearing loss meaning the little hairs inside my ear don’t work. One of the first things the audiologist said is there is no surgery or cure for it but hearing aids could help. From my understanding once a persons hearing is gone there’s no way to bring it back. It will be gone forever but there are treatments like hearing aids that can help

Definitely worth going to a doctor if you haven't. You should at least have someone look in your ears and maybe even an MRI. People live for years with hearing problems that is just wax buildup and hear way better after a cleaning.

Hearing aids and protect your hearing from here on out.   Cutting lawn. Ear protection.  Loud tools. Hearing protect. Protect what you got left.

[tinnitustalk.com](http://tinnitustalk.com) is always discussing potential cures that are 5 years away from being 5 years away and in the end never really get cleared. 

Best you can hope is for hearing aid technology to have a breakthrough so the treatment can equal a cure

There are a multitude of diseases that effect hearing, ranging from the easily treatable to the intractable. Hence you should consult an otolaryngologist who will diagnose the problem with your hearing then provide treatment, such as hearing aids or surgery. Therefore do not purchase hearing aids unless your consultant tells you to!

Go to a doctor.

i would definitely recommend going to a doctor for your hearing. its not curable, but that's okay, i was born with hearing loss and have had HA since i was 6. I remember the first year or so was a bit of an adjustment, they are made to fit as comfortably as they can in your ears, but still can be an adjustment. its important to remember that hearing aids are a tool to interact with your environment on a level other hearing people can. you don't need to wear them 24/7, in fact you shouldn't wear them to bed or whenever your head may get wet (shower, swimming, etc...)

**this is my opinion** and i say this because i hear a lot of stories of adults who loss their hearing feeling ashamed or damaged. you should never feel bad or less than because of hearing loss, and if you refuse to get hearing aids because of how people will perceive you, you will struggle and feel more isolated from your friends and family. obviously i'm biased, because i've been wearing hearing aids since i was a kid, but i never understood why people refuse to get hearing aids. if you you have the financial capabilities and insurance to cover the cost of hearing aids, then i say you should get them. you don't have to wear them all the time, you have the freedom to choose when you do or do not wear them.

Unfortuently when it comes to invisible disabilities people tend to forget that someone is disabled. If it’s not something they deal with or many people they know deal with they can easily forget

I've worn glasses aalmost since birth, and am pretty blind without them.

Even lifelong friends will see me without them only when we go for a swim orrr in the Sauana or something, where I am effectively blind. 

Guess what , no one keeps it in mind aand I constantly need to tell people that I can't see sh\*t without my glasses. 

I nevere gave it much thought, let alone got angry about it. People all have their own worries, and what your sensory organs can can and cannot do is not something that is given space on their brains hard drive. Even when Im underway with a wheelchairr bound buddy I often cannot tell which paths to our goal are wheelchair accessibel and which are not, because it is not something I instinctually pay attention to.

Talking and listening are just \*there\* for most people and happen unconsciously. ""Accomodating"" you means changing things that are done subconsciously 99% of the time, and chances are they need to do it differently around you and only around you. Communicating and talking suddenly becomes the same thing  requiring effort aand concentration as it is for you, while it usually is aan entirely passive process which is never given much though.

I dont think it has a lot to do with the disability being ""invisible"", but the fact that it fundamentally changes communication in a way which most people cannot wrap their heads around. The maay well remember that you are hard of hearing, but not what it means in practice.

I have one coworker who remembers I’m hard of hearing and changes how she communicates when she’s around me. She was raised by a grandmother who is hard of hearing, too, so she’s done that all her life and feels comfortable doing that for me. There’s nothing awkward or cumbersome about it. It’s just how it is and so that’s what she does. I appreciate it so much!

So many of my other coworkers, however, seem to forget. I’m close to 50 years old, my hearing began to fade about 15 years ago, and I had excellent hearing before then. I now have severe to mild hearing loss, with the worst loss in the low frequencies and the very highest frequencies. I’ve only been using hearing aids for the last couple years. I can’t read lips and I don’t know sign language yet, so verbal communication is preferred when text is not an option. When I’m wearing my hearing aids and they are directly in front of me, facing me, and only a few feet away at most, I can hear them well enough to “pass” as fully abled. As soon as they move further away or too far to the side, it all goes to hell. More than six feet away, I can barely hear their voice, let alone discern their words. A dozen feet away or more, they might as well be miming speech because I can see their lips moving but hear no sound. It’s rough! 

So I ask them to bring it in, stand front and center, speak a little louder. Some of them go “oh yeah, my bad” and close the distance. But others just flounder until I say loudly, “I’m having trouble hearing you. I’m going to repeat back what I think you said. Is that right?” I keep it honest, always, because this is not a game, but they invariably become frustrated and come in closer, and then everything’s better. 

One boss doesn’t understand what I’m going through, but he’s a firm believer in solid communication, whatever form that takes. He doesn’t know sign language either but he made up his own signs to communicate with me over a distance. He’s succinct and to the point. “Break time!” “Back to work!” “Work station number ###!” “Need [enter tool here].”  “Come here!” “I’m coming to you!” “I see you need assistance but I’m busy. I’ll be there as soon as I can!” And so on. When he’s front and center, he switches to verbal communication again. It’s so helpful! I wish others would do the same. 

My disability is hard on me. It’s taking my hearing, my sense of physical balance, and more. It’s taking away something I’m passionate about, music. But it’s also hard on people around me. Sometimes, I just want to withdraw because communication is challenging. Sometimes, others get frustrated and withdraw from me for the same reason. It takes effort to remain patient and engaged but it’s worth it. 

No matter what, remain patient and engaged.

I think in part my disability makes me more conscientious about barriers to access for myself and others, while people without a disability, even those who mean well, don’t have that same level of conscientiousness.

have you considered... that you have anxiety about pleasing people and thats why you spend more time remembering such things? i dont mean it in a rude way, i just think that people who dont have that kind of anxiety more easily forget these things, especially because it can be invisible and pretty unnoticable to alot of people

Being hard of hearing is frustrating on a daily basis.    My immediate family struggles to remember to make minor adjustments for me.   And when I remind them, they still forget to face me when talking.    

They will ask if I’m wearing my hearing aids… and I will remind them they are helpful but they don’t fix my hearing.    There are some sounds/pitches/tones that I  am not capable of hearing even with my aids in. 

For some reason they cannot wrap their minds around it.

Yes,this I relate to.whats sad is I have been hard of hearing since it was discovered when I was 5 yr old.

It’s been decades of hearing aids and no hearing aids.  As a kid? Once tearing started I rebelled against wearing them.

When young,with no hearing aid ,I could pass for  a normal hearing person if people were near to me and facing me.

At home? The people who knew me best and should have known better,awareness wise- treated me normal.

Which is nice in a way  but it caused problems too.

Waiting till I leave a room,back turned,to ask me something.
Really? Seriously? Now you decide you have to ask me something?

I was always given the burden of going closer to the person speaking-never the other way around.

So I realized even the people you live with can be totally unaware of the  struggles we hearing impaired individuals face.

The other thing that’s exasperating? People think hearing aids are some magical panacea.   No-not quite.

How they can put a man on the moon but still not perfect hearing aids both astonishes and annoys me to no end.",2024-11-14 21:45:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1grg6dl/why_do_people_forget_i_am_hoh_i_remember_so_much/
1grdc6q,hardofhearing,Push for hearing aids? 11 month old with mild hearing loss,"My son is 11 months (10 months adjusted) and we have had what feels like the longest journey, and I am uncertain on what to do based on conflicting recommendations from Audiology, ENT and ECI (early intervention).

To keep a long story short… Two failed OAEs in the hospital and two more failed OAEs at the ENT. Three ABRs but only one complete test. The first was due to waking up; the second was complete but woke up during the bone conduction/click stimuli portion; and the third was a repeat to confirm those results but he was congested and woke up.

Results showed bilateral high frequency mild hearing loss at 2000 and 4000 Hz. It’s assumed to be sensorineural because he had no fluid in his ears. 

2000 Hz: 25db in right ear, 20db in left

4000 Hz: 35db in right, 30db in left

Audiology and ENT separately reviewed these results and both did not recommend hearing aids at this time, saying his levels are at the lower threshold for mild hearing loss.

We just had our ECI assessment and he showed a 10% delay with expressive communication but no delay with receptive communication. The regional day school teacher over the deaf/hoh programs actually disagreed with audio/ENT and said based on ASHA guidelines, our son should be in aids looking at his levels and she is surprised he is not.

We are going to receive ECI services once a week and speech therapy once every 3 months to keep his language gaps as small as possible. But now I am left wondering, should I push for hearing aids with Audiology/ENT? Is anyone who has this hearing loss or has a child with mild hearing loss able to speak to their experience, aids vs no aids?

ETA as a side note: From newborn to present, he has been meeting milestones (startling, cooing, babbling, turning to sounds) so we never had any concerns at home, even while he was failing his hearing screens.

From a personal perspective; I have a moderate hearing loss, I’ve had it since I was a child, I’m in my 40’s now.
I quit wearing hearing aids for about two decades. I ended up with what’s called a processing disorder. I only understand about 70% of speech. My audiologist said it’s because I’ve “lived in a muffled world for too long”. 

If I had to do it over again, I would’ve gotten them, it was just a lot of money and I had different priorities in my, 20’s &amp; 30’s. But I deeply regret not prioritizing my hearing.

Just my two cents based on my personal experience. I don’t think it could hurt to have him fill the gaps of hearing loss, but it might cause issues if left untreated.

[removed]

I’d consider the speech delay worth getting the hearing aids to be honest. That’s not a huge number but I wouldn’t want it in your place

I've had asymmetrical hearing loss my entire life, it fluctuated greatly.  It was also a conductive hearing  loss.  My right ear was normal as a child.  From what my family has told me.  I was a chatterbox when I was home alone with my Mom.  But in group scenarios, I was a quiet child.  The thing is, people will tell you, "" Oh, they're probably just shy or whatever.""  In hind sight, that's not true for me.  I was quiet because it was a group scenario, and with the number of people around, it took me time to learn their speech patterns to lipread.  Lipreading also works poorly in groups as you only understand what they say when they look at you.

One on one I'd expect your baby to do well, especially when they're close to you.  But how are they doing in group situations?  In background noise situations?  How do they do ""hearing"" you with their back turned to you?  Those are all scenarios that are challenging.  

At the end if the day, it's your decision.  I'd go with what you think.  Change doctors if needed.  My ENT was amazing and fought for me for many years.  My favorite audiologist was Julie.  She was also wonderful.  I had surgery every year from 5 to 12.  Having a doctor who was kind and made me feel better was important.

HAs will make your child's life easier. The only hesitation I think is the cost.  If you feel unsure, watch your child in different listening environments. How is your child doing?  Is your happy chatty baby suddenly quiet?  Do you think it's normal for your little one?  

I'd say trust yourself.  My impression is that you are a thoughtful, caring parent.

Yes! Please get hearing aids as soon as possible. My son has mild to moderate low frequency hearing loss, was diagnosed late (age 4), and is still struggling with significant speech issues. He spends hours a week in speech therapy. I wish to God he would have been diagnosed earlier so we could start services.

Edited to add that my son is 7 now and has been aided since he was diagnosed at age 4.

Absolutely.

My kid didn’t get diagnosed with mild hearing loss until he was 9. He’d passed all tests till we went to an ENT for seasonal ear pain.

We spent one year trying to get schools to cooperate with accommodations and it was such a disappointment.

At the 1 year follow up, my kid insisted on hearing aids. My kid also has audio and sensory processing disorders. I envisioned the year to follow would be a huge power struggle.

This child has worn them every single day except when they don’t charge properly or if they accidentally get worn to bed.

Mild loss is still experiencing communication deprivation. Get all the assistance, learn sign language (I literally went back to school in my mid 30s to learn it for my kid but there are free options like [lifeprint](https://lifeprint.com). Give your kid the best start. They deserve it.

If you do get hearing aids for the kid, learn what my parents learned when I first had it - keep an eye on the kid until he is comfortable with it.

Apparently, I found it stuffy and flushed it down the toilet.

Like an idiot kid I was.

I don't know if there's better strategies nowadays to address that or there's more less stuffy versions nowadays for kids.

Just keep an eye on that should you get the child a hearing aid.

Hi OP! I hope you ended up getting another opinion and hearing aids. This is all new to me, too. My 7 week old was recently diagnosed with mild hearing loss and won't be able to hear consonants F and S. Our audiologist advised us that she'll need hearing aids, and it's better for children to get these early so they don't fall behind when developing speech. He said that there's no medical fix for this right now other than hearing aids. I hope you get the right medical advice and help for your kiddo!",2024-11-14 19:42:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1grdc6q/push_for_hearing_aids_11_month_old_with_mild/
1gqg4wj,hardofhearing,AV Question concerning Bluetooth transceiver to hearing aid,"My dad is hard of hearing and wears hearing aids. For TV he has a box connected through optical cable that can broadcast in Bluetooth to his hearing aids. This works great, however my mom is not hard of hearing and wants to listen on the soundbar which comes out of the TV using HDMI ARC. The current setup doesn't allow this as it is 1 or the other. I thought here might be the best place to ask. My first thought was a AV Reciever after a few splitter boxes wouldn't work with the HDMI copy protection. Then I thought I would ask here as they can't be the only people who have run into this issue.

Any help is appreciated thanks

Solve this and make a zillion dollars

Can you plug the Bluetooth into the optical out from the TV instead of the receiver?

We couldn’t figure this problem out either. It’s BIZARRE that you have to choose one or the other, surely almost everyone with hearing aids watches TV with someone who can hear! And for families where everyone is Deaf, I’m guessing the TV can only send the signal to one set of aids. Argh

1gprc3q,hardofhearing,Tympanoplasty gone wrong ,"I recently had a tympanoplasty procedure done in Denver, CO. The surgeon accidentally cut into an artery causing me to have to return to emergency surgery and get it cauterized. Since then, I have not heard from my surgeon. He has not once called to check on me and see how his fuck up was healing. I can’t hear absolutely anything in the ear the procedure was done and I have a black eye. I have since noticed my vision is now becoming blurry. I called him this morning and he has yet to call me back, or even a nurse. Do i have a lawsuit? 

[댓글]
Depends on the artery cut. Informed consent includes ""damage to surrounding structures,"" so if it was, an artery that runs next to/behind/in front of the inner ear, then technically that risk of damage was consented to (not saying it's right, it's just what informed consent means). 

Either way, I'd head to an emergency room if you lose vision in either of your eyes.

I’m so sorry you’ve had this experience. I have no idea whether you have a lawsuit. But I had a tympanoplasty and for a while I did not have hearing in that ear as they packed the eardrum with dissolvable packing. Until the packing dissolved the hearing was practically nothing. Though this should have been explained to you if this was your process I’m just wondering if the lack of hearing is due to packing in the eardrum? Maybe a question for them if you do get a hold of them. I’m sorry what’s supposed to be a pretty simple surgery was not at all for you. Hopefully you can get it figured out and others are helpful with the lawsuit part of things.

Did things improve?  
I'm looking for a doctor in the Front Range area to do a tympanoplasty. Can you name -- in a private message is fine -- the surgeon who did this so I can avoid them?",2024-11-12 18:15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gprc3q/tympanoplasty_gone_wrong/
1gpns12,hardofhearing,How do you tell people they are hard to understand without being rude?,"Sometimes certain people mumble and also have an accent.. and if you knew that person for a quite a bit of time it may be awkward to tell them … actually you are hard to understand 

[댓글]
I can't recall anyone ever getting angry when i told them i couldn't understand them.  I always stress that it's because of my hearing loss (which is the truth. Accents are much harder to understand when you are HoH.)

“I’m hard of hearing and having a hard time understanding you sorry. Please talk slower/louder etc thank you”

Start by saying something like, “Im sorry, I don’t mean to be rude, but. . .” Then politely tell them that you have trouble understanding what they say, and then tell them how they can help you understand them. It will be an embarrassing moment for them, so try to do it when you are alone with them. 

Be prepared for them to become angry. Sometimes there just isn’t a good way to tell someone you can’t understand them.

I just say “I’m hard of hearing, can you please repeat yourself.” Or ask them to talk more slowly and/or speak louder. I haven’t encountered anyone yet who’s found that to be rude. Usually most people are really understanding. Sometimes, especially in loud places, I’ll let them know that my hearing aid amplify ALL the noise, so I just need them to say it again and face me when talking. Never had an issue with being upfront about my hearing loss.

I live over seas &amp; have this issue a lot.  I tend tell people w/ quiet voices.  I tend not to tell people w/ accents, though i have when i needed them to know.

I think it may be better telling them what you need that they can do.  For example, it would really help me if you can speak directly toward me an.(whatever else would help you).

A common theme in these responses and not a criticism, as very much use the word myself. Am trying my hardest to not use it when asking for clarification or repeats. I wonder if it makes me look a bit soft, pathetic perhaps for apologising. 

But why do we say sorry, we are deaf/hoh? It's not like we asked to be this way or doing it on purpose?

I always say, “I’m deaf, I can’t hear you. Could you please speak up? Or maybe write it down?”

I just smile or even laugh (depending on who it is) and say ""I know you're saying words, I just don't know what they are.""

""My ears are being jerks today and making it harder to hear than usual. Can you repeat that a bit more slowly so my brain can parse it?""

If it's a new-ish acquaintance or something, I'll usually start by saying something like ""wait, have I told you that I have hearing aids?"" If they didn't know then they'll usually apologize and repeat what they said. If they did know then they'll usually say ""oh right!"" and then repeat what they said.

For customer service reps (or for people like doctors or TSA/customs officers) I'll usually just start the interaction by saying ""Just so you know, I'm hard of hearing, I apologize in advance if I ask you to repeat stuff.""

I would say for your scenario, unless you're really close with the person, just say that you didn't hear the specific thing they said rather than telling them they're always hard to understand. If that happens all the time and they're even a little bit self-aware, they'll figure it out.

“I am hearing impaired (or deaf depending on the recipient) and having trouble hearing you, could you please enunciate and look at me when you speak? Thank you!”

I usually tip my good ear towards them, and say, “I’m so sorry, I’m hard of hearing, can you please repeat that?”

It’s rare that I have to ask again, but 99% of people are accommodating.

“I’m sorry, I have hearing loss and even with my hearing aids, I can’t hear you clearly. Could you please repeat that?”

I often blame my ""allergy ears,"" which is a factor some days on top of my regular hearing loss. It seems to put people more at ease. Many of our regular customers have caught on and make sure to enunciate with me.

I would consider a BTE hearing aid instead of a CIC type— they’re more conspicuous so people are more understanding because they notice you’re wearing aids. Plus the tech is just better.

Oh my god I wish I knew the answer. My mother in law had a very unique accent from growing up in many different countries across the world and I can never understand her when she is using her “inside voice”. Gah. Plus in her culture it is rude or obnoxious to talk loudly… so I think I’m screwed.
Edit: I’m a very good lip reader in my language  but with all of her interfering global accents and tendency to mumble when she is at home to be polite, it is IMPOSSIBLE to understand. I even use voice to text on my phone sometimes during dinner and the transcription is comically bad; worse than for other conversations. It doesn’t help that she is my mother in law, and that can be a fraught relationship even without HOH.

I probably say something like “My hearing is unfortunately not good enough to hear you. Would you mind writing that down?” Or similar depending on context. 

If it’s people you rarely meet, that should work. It’s not asking too much. With people you need to collaborate with it’s harder. 

No blaming necessary, just focus on that 1) you are genuinely interested in knowing what they say, but that it’s not possible and 2) invite them to work with you to find reasonable solutions.

Solutions can be anything for taking sign language classes together, writing, using captioning or interpreters, or chatting using text. Work together seeping on the situation.",2024-11-12 15:49:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gpns12/how_do_you_tell_people_they_are_hard_to/

the first post from this account was advertising an app and all the posts are formatted the same. hmm. I'm not telling them my persona struggles for their profit lol

I have one job online thats all text based, and have recently started another that is all sign language based.


My university was also 2/3rds in sign, 1/3rd spoken English - which made it far easier and less tiring in me.

I work in animal care. At meetings I sit close to the speaker if I can, but at least make sure I can clearly see their mouth.

In my daily duties the noises the animals make matter a lot more. Quite often I can hear the sound but not where it comes from, and from what I gather I hear some of the vocalizations differently than others. If I really need a sound identified I record it and play it for someone with normal hearing as trying to imitate usually goes nowhere since it sounds different to me. I actually use the merlin bird app lol. If I can hear a sound that seems like a problem I call it on the radio and someone else will identify where it's coming from.

I have used shoulder mics before as an add on to the walkie talkie but they are sensory hell so I just freeball it. My team knows that if there's an emergency and I don't immediately respond on the radio someone will have to come and physically get me. If I'm doing something where I will have to remove my hearing aids (power washing, working in heavy rain, etc.) I call over the radio before I do that so everyone knows I can't hear them. We also use text if radio isn't working or is too staticy.

i have a real time captioner at school which i rely on heavily and its been really helpful! my job is mostly online meetings or emails so i use automated captions but if its an in person meeting then i use automated ava captioning app and try to sit somewhere where i can easily lipread

Captions on all the things. Live Transcribe app on my phone. Reduce the echo as much as possible in  my exam room (I'm a NP) and I have a program on my HA and CI to reduce echo. Really understanding coworkers and patients.

Implementing duties in any environment-school or workplace-with a hearing disability can prove difficult, but with the right tools and support, thriving in such environments can become manageable. Start by informing your teachers or employers so that they may accommodate your needs. Use hearing aids from Amplifon that can help you differentiate sounds from noise and communicate better by connecting with your devices. Wherever you sit in a classroom or meeting, ensure you can see the faces of the speakers, take notes, and use captions when they are available. And lastly, do not shy away from asking for support- self-advocacy is integral to thriving in any atmosphere.",2024-11-12 11:40:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gpisgw/how_do_you_balance_work_or_school_with_your/

Put your hand on the hood when you get out and feel for vibrations.

Get a carbon monoxide detector for your garage and the adjacent room.

The light around the start / stop buttons in most cars lights up when the car is running.

I leave the radio on as a cue on when the car is turned off or not.

Most new vehicles have an auto-stop feature that cuts the vehicle off after a certain period of idling in park. Check your owners manual for how to customize this setting.

Additionally, a lot of cars that have keyless start/stop also have the ability to start and stop the vehicle from a phone app. See if your vehicle has this ability.

An electric vehicle is an alternative that would solve this issue.

Flashing light indicators from your car. It's a feature you can turn on in most new cars

The modern cars with start stop buttons usually delaminate/switch off on the dashboard/onboard computer screen when the engine is off. I’d use that as a guide. What car do you have

Do you wear hearing aids?

Do you have an iPhone?  There’s a way to set a reminder on your phone which is triggered by location. So, you could set a reminder to check your car after you arrive home.

Get alarms with flashing lights for carbon or fire",2024-11-10 15:56:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1go3pza/extreme_hard_of_hearing_paranoid_about_leaving/

1gnjl9y,hardofhearing,Is there treatment for minor hearing loss? ,"Hey, hope this is the right place to post, I am also going to go to my Dr, but waiting times can be long and referrals through GP can be a nightmare to get so I want to go in prepared so I can say the right thing. 

I've had hearing loss on my left side for as long as I can remember, maybe my whole life? Idk. I used to go to a specialist every year, from the age of 7/8-18 to get it tested. They never gave a reason for the loss or any treatment of any kind for it. At 18 they said I'd aged out of paediatric audiology, and since my hearing hadn't really changed in that time, it wasn't worth me going to see an adult specialist. 

I'm now in my 30s, and I'm genuinely so tired of not being able to hear properly. It makes socialising exhausting. I don't know if it's got worse or I just notice it more now. But I would like support for it, if there is any I can get. Would hearing aids be suitable for mild hearing loss? I've been googling and all the info I'm seeing is about hearing loss is about new hearing loss and not old hearing loss. What things should I be asking the Dr for?

Second question: when I used to do these beep test things as a kid, I remember feeling incredibly anxious about getting it wrong and I would try and concentrate really heard to hear the beeps and sometimes press the button when I wasn't really sure if I heard a sound. Could this have skewed the results? 

[댓글]
What are you classifying as “minor hearing loss”? 

No you would not have skewed the results. Audiologist are trained professionals and the test are designed, generally speaking, to not give false positives.

I remember trying to cheat the beep thing as a kid. Years later I asked my audiologist about it. It doesn't affect the results. They know what you're doing and what's going on.

I've had moderate hearing loss my entire life. It took till the age of 21 to get hearing aids, and then another decade or so to really commit to wearing them every day all day. But once I did, it was life-changing.

IMO it's never too late to get them and it will absolutely help you, assuming of course that your audiogram confirms your assumptions/suspicions. The *type* of hearing loss does matter, however, so that's something you'll just have to talk to your audiologist about.

What type of treatment are you looking for? Hearing aids? Or like... some sort of therapy/ surgery?",2024-11-09 20:48:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gnjl9y/is_there_treatment_for_minor_hearing_loss/
1gn664s,hardofhearing,Have You Ever Tried Speech-to-Text Technology in Noisy Environments?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to know if any of you have used speech-to-text technology in noisy places, like crowded restaurants, busy streets, or during public events. Does it actually work well, or do you find it hard to catch what people are saying with all the background noise?

I’ve tried it a few times, and it’s been hit or miss—sometimes it’s pretty accurate, but other times, the noise makes it hard to understand anything. Have you found any tips, apps, or settings that help make speech-to-text better in these situations?

I’d love to hear about your experiences and how you manage in noisy environments!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 😊

It can still be difficult sometimes but I've found that using the Recorder app exclusively available on Google Pixel phones (any model from 4 upwards) is really great. 
It's not advertised as a speech to text app but it has a live transcribing feature which is incredibly fast and quite accurate even in crowded settings.
When it's really loud like a bar with music and chatter I usually put the phone microphone (or external microphone that is connected to the phone) as close as possible to the people speaking. 
Of all apps that I've tried I found this one to be the most reliable and highly recommend it. 
Pixel phones also have a bunch of hearing loss accessibility features like captioned calls, isolating voices in calls with a lot of background noise etc.

Good luck!

Yes and it's really difficult. I use a Roger Mic in noisy environments and it helps a lot but definitely not perfect.

I’m lucky if I can get speech to text to work in a silent room. I’d consider it useless with background noise.",2024-11-09 09:06:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gn664s/have_you_ever_tried_speechtotext_technology_in/
1gn0q26,hardofhearing,I wore ribbed earplugs to sleep and now can’t hear out of one ear ,"My left ear had the rubber (ribbed) ear plug pushed in firmly creating a vacuum. This morning when I took out the plugs, my left ear feels like I just got off the plane and everything is muffled. 

I tried yawning, warm water flush, and closing my nose and blowing to equalize without any luck. It’s been 2 hours now and I’m freaking out. Has anyone else experienced this before?

UPDATE: Went to an ENT today and the doc looked in my ear with a tube camera. He said my ear drum is intact, but the flesh all around it is inflammed and red, as opposed to white and translucent. He’s putting me on a 3 day course of antibiotics and painkillers. He advised I stop doing the nose ear popping thing, don’t apply pressure, and stop using those earplugs. No permanent damage, thank god. Also, TIL contrary to popular belief, ribbed does not equal more pleasure. 

Thanks everyone for your input!!

UPDATE #2: I’m on day 3 of meds. Woke up last night in the middle of the night suddenly realizing my hearing had returned. It was super muffled up til that point. Thank god. I’m so relieved. YAY!!

A doctor needs to take a good look at your ears.

[deleted]

yes id go to an ENT ASAP!!!! However, also sounds to me like it's probably smth to do with your eardrum and that is preferable to middle or inner ear...coming from someone w inner ear deafness. but seriously go to the ER and get it looked at 💗💗💗

Does it hurt?

It sounds like your friend might have created a seal in the ear canal with the earplug, which could have led to a temporary change in pressure or even mild suction. This can cause a feeling of fullness in the ear or a vacuum-like sensation, sometimes leading to temporary hearing loss or altered hearing perception. The whooshing sound when they burp could be due to pressure changes affecting the ear, possibly because of trapped air or fluid in the middle ear.

Encourage your friend to avoid using anything in the ear canal to “fix” it themselves, as this can sometimes worsen the problem. Instead, they should see a healthcare provider or an ear specialist (ENT) to assess the ear and safely relieve any blockage or pressure issues. Often, doctors can gently remove any trapped earwax or assess if there’s fluid in the ear that needs treatment. It’s usually a straightforward issue to address with the right care, but it’s best to have it checked by a professional.

Same with eyelashes, it will just fall into our eyes when it is suppose to protect us.

1gmigzk,hardofhearing,How Do You Feel About Subtitles in Movies and TV Shows?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to start a discussion about subtitles—do you enjoy using them, find them helpful, or maybe even find them distracting? Personally, I love subtitles because they help me catch details I’d miss otherwise, especially in fast-paced scenes or with background noise. But I know sometimes they can be a bit off or cover part of the screen.



Do you have any preferences when it comes to subtitles? Do you use them all the time, or are there specific types of shows or movies where you find them especially helpful (or not)? Let’s share our thoughts!



Looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks!

[댓글]
I use them for everything. I love that Prime gives options to change the size and how it appears. I wish more streaming services did that.

Getting captions/subtitles back in the 90’s was a game changer for me.  I have no idea how I was able to watch TV without them, the difference in understanding shows and movies was night and day.  It’s basically why I never go see movies in theaters.

I use them all the time, subtitles help me especially when sfx and music compete with the dialogue.

I have to use them for everything—my hearing loss is severe enough that I can’t understand anything otherwise. But it’s awful when the captions are noticeably wrong or off in timing! I almost aways watch subbed rather than dubbed anime, for example, since the captions for dubs are often off. 

I have a lot of friends who use captions, even if they don’t need them, and that’s nice, especially since it seems like streaming services are responding to the greater demand. 

On the flip side, I have a friend who often invites me to musicals and I wish they would give attendees a booklet of lyrics or something so I’m not lost the whole time!

I like subtitles but I find they can sometimes be unreliable and that’s distracting.  I was watching a show on Netflix yesterday and noticed the caption was incorrect. I also don’t like when the caption colour is the same for all characters. Makes it harder to tell which character is speaking off camera

They are mandatory, and it drives me nuts when there's a problem with them. Prime has been the biggest offender in this regard. For example, shows like *Retired at 35* and *Happily Divorced* from TVLand have messed up subtitles

I use them for everything that has them. I miss out on too much without them

I have them on all the time, it can be difficult without them. I tried rewatching something i first I saw years ago but it doesn't have subtitles and I had to give up, I could not understand a lot of the dialogue

I need them for everything. Its a must.

Love them. Use them all the time, TV movies and gaming.

I use them all the time and it’s beyond infuriating when they don’t put EXACTLY what is being said or if there’s a lag

Unfortunately “how I feel about them” isn’t really a factor lol I need them no matter what

I could get behind having open captions on screen in the theatre. My local one has captioning devices that work pretty well and are way better than nothing. 

I wish work meeting recordings and video presentations my work made had captions as a rule. They mostly don’t which makes them much less useful.

I caption everything these days. Catering my experience to only the actors/actresses I can easily hear is limiting and imperfect.

See when they automatically put them on foreign films, and they do it in WHITE font with no dark background or outline. So you spend the whole film glued to the subtitles trying to make them out instead of looking at anything else! Its sooooo annoying!.

It's annoying being stuck to subtitles but kinda essential unless you wanna deafen everybody else. A loud TV is also a tell tale sign of deafness to neighbours and burglars and I don't think should be advertised! I like subtitles to come on a fraction of a second after the things are said because subtitles are very good at killing the joke early, or spoiling things.

I love them now but disliked them as a kid (my mom and sister are also HoH and I didn’t have hearing loss until I was 16). I think it bugged me because the TV was always booming loud and then part of the screen was covered up by bad captions and it was hard to turn them off. But that was the late 90’s and they’ve gotten a lot better. Now I especially love them because I can watch YouTube without waking my baby!

Difficult to watch anything without it now, the hearing isn’t what it was.

I use them for everything. No subtitles, no closed-caption...I don't watch it. Why bother.

I love  them because  that way I don't  have to blast  everyone's ears to understand quiet dialogue

I use captioning all the time and am a very fast reader as a result! I also started using captions on Zoom which is very helpful. Live tv like sports and news are the only downside as captions are delayed.

I love them and use them all the time. I find it so sad to read people can find the distracting in the US. It just doesn’t happen here. All movies have open captions in the movie theater.

I like them but find them obtrusive and inconsistently put on screens and many times it’s delayed but that’s very source dependent, tv, streaming, etc.

I use them all the time!

Love them! Use them for everything.. I even use live transcribe to caption daily life. When captioned glasses become more widely available and affordable, as well as comfortable to wear, I will be in line to get a pair!

1gm0qjf,hardofhearing,College and social struggles (just a rant ig),"Hi, I'm 20yo and started uni in October. I had hearing loss probably all my life (three of my family members are deaf, including both my parents) or most of my life at least; it's impossible to know for sure but even when I was a small kid doctors thought I was deaf :) It was really hard for me to realize, as I grew up, that I do not hear well, and everyone else doesn't struggle with understanding people like I do. I cannot tell you how hard I made my own llife only because I didn't want to admit I had serious hearing problem.

Anyway I finally started to slowly face it this year, which led to making an audiologist appointment in September and getting hearing aids. Hurray, right? So, I have 50&lt; db loss in my left ear, and 40db dropping rapidly to 80db at 1k Hz in my right ear. My speech understanding has been depeneding on my left ear for god knows how long. I got Starkey HAs. We also tried Oticons for a week but I didn't like them very much and they were out of my price range.

I thought I was doing better with HAs (and don't get me wrong, I know I am. I wouldn't even consider getting a degree without them), or that was, until I moved out to uni. What's the problem? Talking and socializing with people. Also, listening in some classes  - not all of them tho - there's just one class where there is an echo in the room when a professor speaks and I can't understand half the thing she says (and I had a very awkward situation today because I misheard what she said), otherwise I'd say I can understand about 80-90% of what other professors say. I want to trust myself that, if I had problem with me not hearing/not understanding anything, I would reach out to prof. Which leads to another (main?) thing. No one knows I wear HAs. Or at least I think so, maybe someone saw a wire in my left ear (it sllightly falls out sometimes). I feel like a group of girls I have been associates with may suspect something or they probably think I am weird and dumb, because I barely speak when they talk. I cannot understand most of what they're saying when we're in the corridor or walking on campus or almost any other situation. I can't understand people in plenty other situations, and I am just giving up as we speak on making any friends in college, because well, impossible. And before anyone proposes that, I am not ready to let them know I wear HAs. There are only two people who know that I wear them, one of them being my rommate and one other person I told willingly. 

I know I should make an appointment with my audio (he's out currently anyway), but I just feel so tired and bad about this, because we already made like 6 or something adjustments? And I don't know what to tell him, that it still doesn't work? Like the HAs help me, but they don't help me the way I wanted them to? I am honestly exhausted of analyzing every situation when I can't hear/understand things. I'm also thinking that maybe I hit the wall, and that's it. That's the best HAs can do for me (which is pretty dissapointing but maybe I had my hopes up way too high).

So, that was a rant. I just had to put it out somewhere I guess, because I don't have a single person to talk to about all this. Or anyone who would understand. Apologises for grammar mistakes and others, English is not my first language :)

You say that English isn't your first language, but I just want to throw it out there that if you're in the United States (for example), your professors may be required to make any number of disability accommodations on your behalf. Does your school have disability services? Have you gotten in touch with them? 

Can definitely be hard to make friends at college. Do you have any hobbies? Are there any clubs you're interested in? I don't think I made any friends outside of Student Organizations until senior year. People are much more accommodating when you share common interests, at least in my experience

Sorry to hear you’re having trouble. Is there a particular fear you have of sharing your hearing aid use with the girls you socialize with? Have you considered what life would be like in the working world?  Is there a hearing loss organization or support group in the city you’re in?

Hey, there. It seems like you are feeling really down about your hearing, and I get it. Given your experience with your mom, and her despair around her deafness, I can understand why you are hesitant to share that you are struggling to hear. 

For me, being open about my hearing loss and use of hearing aids has been nothing but a positive. I know you aren’t ready to share that with the wider world. But you mentioned one particular professor that is difficult up understand. I would encourage you to ask your audiologist if there is a way to use your hearing aids in that particular context. 

For instance, mine can use the microphone of my phone and stream the sound via blue tooth to my ears. So I can leave my phone on the lectern next to the speaker, and my phone’s microphone will pick up their speech. Is that something you’d be open to trying? 

The more specific you can be in articulating the situations where you struggle to hear the more your hearing aids can be programmed to support you. 

I wish you nothing but good energy as you follow a journey of self-acceptance and self-advocacy. Those are hard things, and absolutely worth pursuing. 

With love from this hard of hearing mom of kids your age!!

Hi!! This is going to be super long so bear with me lol. 

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. You sound a lot like me a couple years ago! First of all, DO NOT give up on this. You are doing amazing and it sounds like you’ve already made some great progress in your hearing journey; so proud of you for figuring out what you need and getting hearing aids. 

New hearing aids can be absolute hell to get used to and it can really mess with your head. I got new aids two years ago after having my old ones for 8 years, and until my brain got used to the new ones I felt like the settings were still wrong. Now if I put on my old ones, they sound way too quiet and I can’t believe how I dealt with them for so long. It’s wild! 

Since this is your first time wearing hearing aids I’m guessing it might take a bit longer for you to get used to them. It’s only November and your brain probably still needs to become familiar with all the new sounds, so be patient with yourself (and wear them as often as you can, if possible) and know that it’ll get easier and then everything will sound normal. 

Also, the most important thing here: practice advocating for yourself! I just graduated college, so I’ve been in your shoes and know how scary it can be to be vulnerable and open about your hearing loss- it was a major struggle for me too. But let me tell you that your life will get so much easier if you start taking small brave steps and trusting that there are people out there (including professors!!) who want to support you and help you get what you need. 

I know you’re not ready yet, but being open and letting people know you wear hearing aids so they can be aware of your struggles is one of the most important pieces of self-advocacy. When I meet new people, all I have to say is just a simple and confident, “by the way, I wear hearing aids so I’d love it if you could speak up a bit!”, and that’s that. People usually just say “Oh, okay cool” or if they’re particularly interested might ask me how long I’ve worn them or share a personal anecdote about hearing loss. Ok, awesome, moving on. In my experience, people are always grateful that you let them know- and when people know, you can feel safer about asking them to speak up or repeat something that was said. Your hearing loss is a part of what makes you you, and if people are ever rude about it or disrespectful to your needs, those probably aren’t people worth your time anyway. 

Even if you’re nervous and not feeling confident, maybe try faking it til you start believing it. Though I’ve worn hearing aids 24/7 since I was in preschool, I struggle a lot with confidence too, especially since growing up, I only knew one other kid with hearing aids- so I get what you’re feeling. I’ve worn my hair down in public my whole life to cover up my hearing aids because I’ve always been so afraid that people would treat me differently if I had them on display. I still feel vulnerable with my hair up, but when I speak about my hearing loss I try to do so with an air of confidence even if I’m not quite feeling it. Hell yeah, I wear hearing aids!! 

However, even if you’re not ready to let peers or new friends know, that’s valid! Most universities have a disability resource center, and there you can connect with an advocate on campus who will be your support person and help you practice telling people what you need, and get to that place of confidence. 

Something I did ahead of every semester that really saved me was emailing all of my professors a letter introducing myself as a student with disabilities and outlining my specific needs to succeed in their class. My advocate helped me a lot with this (it was actually her idea!), and would often have me send her the letter so she could email it to my professors, and I wouldn’t have to worry about it. Doing something like this is super important, because by law you should be allowed accommodations for your hearing loss. My accommodations were (1) closed captioning on all videos shown in class AND for homework, and transcripts provided if captions are unavailable, (2) a student notetaker who would transcribe the lecture or activity and then hand me the notes after class, (3) testing in a separate room, and (4) extra testing time (since it takes me longer to process information). Getting everything in writing was another thing I had to fight for because I miss so many verbal instructions in class, especially instructions that are said in passing. 

These were mine, but everyone has different needs! If you know sign, interpreter services are an accommodation as well. Even now in the middle of the semester, you can totally email your profs and tell them you’ve been working with the disability office and that you have some accommodations you’d like them to be aware of. Disability Services should be able to help you with all of the support and accommodations you need; you should never have to suffer.

Also, make that appointment with your audiologist and get your hearing aids exactly how you need them!!! Do not feel guilty about that, it’s YOUR hearing and it is your right to hear exactly the way you want to. When I got my new aids I went to a local audiologist like 10 times to program them how I wanted, and when they still couldn’t do it right, I switched to another audiologist. If he has any weird issue, that’s his problem, not yours! Filter all those worries out and focus on getting what you need. 

I know it’s all exhausting right now, but have you tried Phonak at all? Probably biased, but I’ve used them my whole life and personally prefer them to Oticon and Starkey (though I know everyone’s different).

Please PM me if you have questions or guidance or just need to vent about this stuff!! I’m so sorry that this is happening. It’ll all be okay, just trust the process and focus on getting the support you need 🫶 you totally got this",2024-11-07 20:49:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gm0qjf/college_and_social_struggles_just_a_rant_ig/
1glxi77,hardofhearing,Hearing aids for small ears?,"Hi all! 

I have had hearing aids for about 5 years now. I can't wear them all the time because they are over-the-ear and I have small ears that are very close to my head, so the HAs hurt the back of my ears, especially if I have to wear glasses. I try to only wear glasses (whether sunglasses or reading glasses) that have thin wire frames, but that doesn't always help, and god forbid I have to go somewhere that requires I wear a mask, too. 

I know there are in-the-ear HAs, but I'm afraid that they wouldn't work because again, my ears are so small. I've struggled with using earplugs because of the same reasons, even when I've bought ones that are specifically for small ears. My audiologist has kind of shrugged at me and said they don't carry anything smaller, so I also have to find a different audiologist that carries brands other than ReSound or Phonak. 

 Do you guys have any recommendations on brands that might be more comfortable? I'd like to be able to wear them all the time, and not just when I need them for work. TIA

For masks use ear savers so your ears aren't part off the equation. 


I would wonder out loud about pediatric hearing aids. It's an out of the box idea, but could it be made to work?

As someone who has a small mouth and has been asking for pediatric X-rays for years at the dentist (and has had to have x-rays done twice when a dental tech didn’t want to listen) I’d ask for pediatric hearing aids here too. The word pediatric probably freaks people out some but they’re just a smaller size since kids are smaller

My 9mm domes on my HAs caused pain and soreness when wearing for short or long periods of time. I buy 7mm and 8mm on Ebay and they make a great deal of difference.  Do you wear glasses? You could try those little plastic retainer loop accessories that connect your heating aids to your glasses so they don't fall off your head?

Oticon based hearing aids works well for mine! I have the RICs and they fit great with glasses too :)

Luckily I don’t wear glasses but I understand the weight that bears down, can’t help you there

I have small ears and wear glasses frequently. My hearing aids are Oticon Opn S2 RITE. My wire length is size 1 and I have a 6mm dome on the right one, and an 8mm dome on the left. It’s a pretty good setup for me, and most of the time I can’t feel them.

I have teeny tiny child ears according to my audiologist. Oticon has been great for me! The ones I have are older and I need to update but they're the Opn mini rite S I think. Expensive unfortunately.

Edit: oh and I use 6mm domes.

My aunt has really tiny ears too and had the same struggle with most hearing aids. She's using audien ion pro now and she says they're super comfy. It's slimmer than regular hearing aids so it fits her ears way better. Maybe that could work for you too?

get  the  Innocaption app.   I am severe/profound and  have very poor hearing.

Innocaption works well.

iPhones will let him caption calls. I’m not sure how well it works in Spanish since I don’t speak it but perhaps a Spanish speaking friend with an iPhone wouldn’t mind changing a few settings to see if it helps.

For making calls, InnoCaption is the app to go IMO.

To help him with social interaction, I would recommend he get a transcription app. I am currently using an app called Ava.

Also maybe look into those new fandangled AR glasses.

Thanks for the responses. My dad has a flip phone. I was thinking about getting him an iPhone to help. Idk if he’ll be able to grasp learning a new phone sadly. He’s had a tough life health wise. He’s on dialysis and only has vision in one eye. He’s broken an ankle in the last couple years. And now not being able to hear. All of those have been tough. But this one hurts the most.

One possible option is a bone conduction headset, which transmits sound through vibrations directly to the bones near the ear, bypassing the eardrum.  Purchase one from a store where you have the full refund return option in case it does not work for your dad.",2024-11-05 23:55:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gkl6hw/cellphone_for_my_dad_with_profound_hearing_loss/

Hahaha this is great! I have What! Behind my right ear and Huh!? Behind my left🤣

Love it!! I wanted one so badly when I was only deaf in one ear but I never knew what to get. Now both ears suck so…. Anyone with HOH or deaf in both ears got some good hearing related tattoos to share?

I am also severe hearing loss in my left ear and just got my first hearing aid today (it has been a long journey and “hearing” in stereo made me cry!). I absolutely love this!

love this!!

I love this!

This is so fun! I love it. 

Been considering getting something behind my left since my right is a bit better ☺️

So good! Love it.

I have been considering this! It looks great. How badly did it hurt?

Ohhhhhh, that's good! I love it!

1gi3qca,hardofhearing,Experiencing music for people with hearing loss ,"Hello all,

I am a student, currently studying at the University of Leeds, doing a design project on experiencing music for people with hearing loss. I would really like to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of the people within this community. If you have 5 minutes spare, it would really be appreciated if you could fill in a quick survey (mostly multiple choice, with bulk ethics approval from the university).

Thank you and have a nice day!

As a person with profound lifelong hearing loss using aids mainstream without benefit of ASL, plus a traumatic accidental loss of more hearing during college (my fault), I am glad to have found and submitted my part to this survey.  Hope it is beneficial!

I would add, as great as technology is that has helped me, there are so many advantages to having hearing loss/deafness but at the same time it can be so isolating and being treated differently socially &amp; economically (fallout from job requirements/opportunities).  For example, it’s great not to hear everything as it may not be worth being heard, but there are times hearing something is crucial and valuable to one’s immediate sphere of influence or by which they’re being influenced.

Just did this! What a great idea

I am curious about your thresholds and descriptions. Moderate as unable to understand almost any speech? What are these metrics based on? Are they based on with or without amplification? It’s not aligning with my understanding of thresholds and access. Want to make sure your assessment makes sense before I complete the study",2024-11-02 19:02:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gi3qca/experiencing_music_for_people_with_hearing_loss/
1ghkmml,hardofhearing,I can not put up with this bulls/it anymore.,"2.5 years, several doctor visits. Everybody says mu hearing is normal, but it is NOT. 
I'm 21 y.o Male.

I have constant tinnitus on my left ear, and tinnitus that comes and goes on my right ear. I think I damaged my ears with headphones, high volume.
I can cope with tinnitus, I'd say, but my right ear hears much lesser than my left one. I have to balance it by lowering left side with equalizer apps. Somewhere between 7-10dB helps. I've been doing this for past 2 years. But when doctors check my hearing with special equipment, they can not find the underlying issue, they even say I shouldn't have tinnitus. I cleaned my ears multiple times, went to ENTs, went to audiologists. What should I do now? I don't have any idea, I'm afraid right side will get even worse, completely deaf If I don't take any cautions. What do you suggest? What would be the cause? Thanks in advance.

# Sounds like [Auditory processing disorder (APD).Auditory processing disorder (APD)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20555261)

“I’m afraid right side will get even worse, completely deaf” from your results that’s not a concern atm. The audiologist and ent should have advised you on ways to manage your tinnitus since that’s the problem. As for taking precautions that’s a great idea. Anything that stops the tinnitus from getting worse is a plus

It sucks.... but tinnitus is an elusive symptom. I;ve had it for over 15 years - came out of a relatively rare disease but it took years to diagnose. Here's the thing... it doesn't matter. Because tinnitus once it starts, with rare exceptions (a mild infection, a physically clogged ear, etc), once it's there it doesn't go. Learning to cope with it is the best you can do - but it's certainly doable!

Loads of people have tinnitus for loads of different reasons. The doctors are telling you your hearing is normal because it is, you have no loss. As others mentioned, tinnitus can happen for a very wide variety of reasons and it rarely goes away. For me personally it comes and goes, but I have moderately severe loss in one ear and moderate in the other with a lifelong history of chronic ear infections and now otosclerosis. You may never find the cause and it will most likely never go away. Definitely look for support groups online! They're so nice to be apart of when you're struggling with things like this.

Besides not listening to loud music, there is nothing you do.

If they didn’t do speech audiometry, they should do that.

You have very good hearing according to that diagram.

Sometimes it might feel like tinnitus is in the way and makes it harder to pick sounds out, but that’s not really a hearing loss, just how tinnitus can influence cognition regarding hearing.

This is general thoughts based on the original post and some of the comments.

Tinnitus doesn't always have a straight forward cause and in many ways is more neurological than otological. I have a lifelong history of a myriad of ear issues since infancy. Mostly middle ear in childhood, and I've had bilateral high pitch tinnitus since age 8. I can't begin to tell you why. Was it the antibiotic I had a reaction to? Was it one too many infections? I have no clue. In the end it doesn't really matter. Also, tinnitus is often a death of a thousand cuts, no single one does it except in extreme exposure or medical instances. Even when it is hair cell damage it doesn't happen in a day and isn't a question of what, but when. There's countless generic, environmental, pure chance factors that make up the equation. That final straw just happened to be the one, if it wasn't that piece of straw the next to fall would have done it. 

What I do know is the current best treatment tends to be behavioral. I've learned to not pay attention to it, and if it wears at me things that will distract away from it. Though I can be alone with it in the dark silence and it just not get in the way. My 9 or 10 year old brain when I realized that it was never going to go away just redefined silence to include that sound. 

There are some really positive patient groups out there and different programs formal and informal to retrain your brain.

I've actually needed them at reinforcement at points since I developed inner ear disease that leads to fluctuations in my tinnitus that I do need to pay attention to (Menieres with a twist). So I've had to learn to check in to note changes when those changes mean potential relapse take action, and then check back out and not get hyper focused and freaking out at every little shift and falling to the panic and doom that threatens to be par for the course with Menieres Disease. 

So it seems most potential scary things have been ruled out and it can be the time now to instead look at solutions for you on how to manage this. It takes time, and no two solutions are going to look exactly the same, but there is a life with this where it can mostly live in the background and not be in the way, it doesn't seem like it but it's there.

This is the project of an old friend of mine 
https://rewiringtinnitus.com/

Not selling any of his stuff or proffering his way as being the way, but there are some solid roots to how he approaches things. And there's a lot of positive communities that are solution focused on managing tinnitus in his orbit. Dude is a marvel he has the type of Menieres that's far more treatment resistant than mine and is just the living embodiment of how to manage it. He actually like me had tinnitus unrelated beforehand and his own coping strategies for it were unmoored by Menieres and he kinda got to analyze what had actually worked from before, what research had come out since and tailor this. And then more and more of people in the support groups we were in were finding it helpful. 

Point being he's allowed to not be your cup of tea, but the core premise of habituation is the path forward. It can look like dozens of things. Also unless he has drastically changed he promotes himself sure, but he doesn't care if you buy the book, or spend a cent on him. 

One of many papers on habituation and lots of other interesting tinnitus info
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850883/

Page from a tinnitus association on it, I believe Australia 
https://tinnitus.org.au/management/habituation/

Worth noting it doesn't make it go away and companion issues won't necessarily improve like auditory processing, but for anything else to make an impact, even what other conditions may be in play, will be easier to find and treat with habituation being present.",2024-11-02 00:45:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ghkmml/i_can_not_put_up_with_this_bullsit_anymore/

1gglbu2,hardofhearing,Concert Interpreter - Can they move you and not your companions?,"Hi all. I hope this is an appropriate place to pose this question. I am attending a sold-out concert soon with another HoH individual and 2 others. We requested an interpreter for the show, but we just found out today that they are only relocating me and the other HoH girl, not the whole party. 

Can they do this? I understand that it’s a sold-out show, but aren’t they under an obligation to relocate up to 3 companions to contiguous seats, or at least move the others in the party as close to us as possible?

It’s rather frustrating as I feel like if we had separately requested accommodations, we each would have been granted a companion. 

I’ve never had this happen before and don’t know how to proceed. 

Edited for clarity in P2

AFAIK there’s nothing that forces them to keep your party together. At comic con when the room is full, they will have your partner sit somewhere near. If the venue only had 10 deaf seats, they might already have 8 other people who requested terps. 

The last concert I attended had a spot in the pit sectioned off. I was the only deaf person but there was plenty of room for my friends.

1ggj26i,hardofhearing,Which Social Media Platform Do You Find Most Accessible?,"Hey everyone! I’m curious about which social media platform you find the most accessible and easy to use. Some platforms have great captioning features, while others are harder to navigate for those of us who are deaf or hard of hearing.

For me, Instagram has been pretty good with captions on stories, but sometimes I find YouTube’s auto-captions can be hit or miss. How about you? Do you have a favorite platform that makes accessibility easier, or maybe one that still has a long way to go?

Let’s compare experiences and maybe find some hidden gems! 😊

[댓글]
The biggest one I have is one you mentioned: YouTube and their vile auto captions. Every single time it’s clear a YouTuber has either paid to have their captions professionally done or taken the time to personally caption the video I have to leave a thank you comment to let them know the extra effort isn’t unnoticed. I have a lot of channels I absolutely love because they caption consistently

I believe TikTok is meant to be really good for captioned content but it’s not a platform I really use. Instagram seems most consistent with auto captions and because a lot of it is short form videos and designed to also be on TikTok I think creators make more of an effort to make it accessible to the d/Deaf HOH community. Agree with others that YouTube is hit and miss, quite often the captions are so bad I end up giving up on watching.

One thing I have to do (with YouTube) as a HOH person is slow down the speed at which the video plays. Foreign accents seems to run so fast I cannot follow otherwise.

[댓글]
Sorry you got treated that way. 

Do you have an ENT to help you go over the results? They can see if there’s an underlying condition, although if you’ve been HoH this long, there’s probably nothing that can be done besides what you are already doing with hearing aids. 

You seem to have mild to moderate loss but nowhere near the worst I’ve seen.

Be forewarned, I am a layman and have absolutely no training other than having profound hearing loss for 40 years.

What you have is an audiogram describing the hearing loss you have in comparison to the average person.

This is what the common sounds are on that audiogram

https://www.centralspeech.ca/uploads/ck/images/audiogram_of_familiar_sounds.jpg

When you compare the two, it should help you figure out what sounds you can grasp and what is past the threshold of the capabilities of the body's sound processing.

The khz (kilohertz) are the pitch range and the dbl (decibel loss) is the loudness loss. Hearing loss is both based on the loudness and pitch capabilities.

When a hearing aid/cochlear implant is programmed, it takes on what you can hear in the pitch and amplifies that and ignores what you can hear well and also... ignores the pitch range of what you cannot hear at all even with sound amplification since it would not work.

Your hearing loss goes into the severe range. It’s bad. How old are your hearing aids?

You have moderate to severe hearing loss in your right ear (moderate at low pitch/frequency sound graduating down to severe at high pitch/frequency sound) and your left ear is severe hearing loss across all pitches/frequencies.

The number of decibels (DB) measures how loud something is in order for you to be able to hear a sound in a frequency. 70db means you could only hear something when it was played at 70db, which is loud to most people but not the loudest. Most people only need the sound to be played at about 0db-25db. Needing to play a sound at 25db/30db (depends who you ask) or louder is classed as having mild hearing loss.

Do you have an audiologist? I see mine every year. I complete a hearing test. I get new hearing aids every 3 years. I always have talks with my audiologist about how well I can hear with my hearing aids and how much I have to increase the volume to hear. We have made numerous adjustments as I have adjusted to wearing hearing aids. If you can see one, I think you will get more support. 🫂

You're moderate-severe, I'd say. I'm moderate at 45-65db loss across the board

[deleted]

The [ shapes show the test results for your ear bones. The X and O shapes are the test results for your eardrums. 

There are mainly 2 parts of the ear that are responsible for hearing: your ear bones and eardrums. Both the [ and X/ O shapes should be toward the top of the graph, anywhere between the -20 and 20 values on the y-axis. Anything below that is considered hearing loss. 

Therefore, you have lots of hearing loss on both sides due to both your ear bones and eardrums not functioning properly.",2024-10-31 00:42:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gg266j/can_anyone_tell_me_how_bad_my_hearing_loss_is/

Hyperbaric helps with healing due to oxygen saturation, but I don’t think it would help unless there’s an open wound.

I have no idea how lasers would help either. Good luck though.

There's a lot of snake oil surrounding hyperbaric and laser treatments these days. Both together sounds sketchy as hell. 

Who's trying to sell you on this treatment? If there's an MD involved, check their record with state medical board.

My most pronounced hearing loss is in the lower frequencies, but the highest frequencies are dim, too. I wear hearing aids in both ears.

Music has always been important to me. I played the flute, guitar, vibraphone, and keyboards when I was younger. In my teens, radio was far more important to me than TV, and I loved wearing headphones in the dark to explore the stations. In college, I took singing lessons. As an adult, I invested in the highest quality speakers and headphones I could afford. Then chronic tinnitus caused constant roaring, like standing near a powerful waterfall, and my hearing began to fade. I knew I was losing lower frequencies when I had to pump up the bass just to hear it. I was devastated when my ENT and audiologist confirmed that I wasn't imagining things. I was hard of hearing.

Ever since then, I have been totally fixated on music, even more than before. I devote every moment I reasonably can to deep diving into the discographies and live performances of my favorite artists. I explore Spotify and YouTube, looking for anything I might have missed in my youth and upcoming artists alike. I have even started collecting books about musical artists and digging through online libraries for archived magazine articles. I want to hear everything. I want to know everything. I want to experience as much music as I can as deeply as I can before it's taken from me. It guts me to know I can't hear music the same way as people with full hearing, and never will again.

1gf3yhj,hardofhearing,"Subtitles on smart glasses, but actually useful for DHH people (AirCaps)","We're a tiny team of 2 that is trying to make smart glasses for people with hearing loss - but ones that are ACTUALLY USEFUL for the d/Deaf &amp; HoH community! You can see them at[ www.aircaps.com](http://www.aircaps.com/)

We've personally tried almost every single smart glasses product over the course of years (XRAI, Xander, HearView, Leion, Epson, Sony, etc.). What we've realized is that these devices have so much potential for the hearing loss community, but the people developing them usually don't think deeply about how to make them actually useful for d/Deaf &amp; HoH users. They don't involve the community in the design process - most are just adapting existing general consumer products for this use case, rather than designing the product from the ground up with d/Deaf &amp; HoH needs in mind.

We wanted to do something because of personal experiences with family members and close friends. So we decided to develop a product that makes some tradeoffs on the ""general consumer"" front, but is actually tailored for the people who will use it.

Based on talking to over 500 people in the community across 5 different countries (and our own experiences trying out glasses in Broadway &amp; movie theaters and tech conferences), here's what we thought was the priority:

1. Designed by the DHH community, for the DHH community (outsider ""technologists"" will never know what the lived experience is like)
2. Full, unfiltered, and truly equal access. This means accuracy as CLOSE to 100% (95% as claimed by many companies is not going to cut it). Also, no censoring (this is what HearView does), or other filtering.
3. Comfort, comfort, comfort. The Sony and Epson glasses on Broadway &amp; in movie theaters are UNBEARABLE. Same with XReal glasses. We couldn't wear them for more than 10 minutes without headaches, pain around the nose, behind the ear. So we made a tradeoff - our glasses max out at 36 grams because comfort is paramount, rather than packing in high-res screens for gaming.
4. Aesthetically appealing (aka, no ""glasshole"" appearance). We're not saying that people should ""hide"" their assistive technology (we actually think the opposite). But at the same time, that doesn't mean you should look like a complete dork when wearing a clunky headset (just look at pictures of the XRAI One glasses or the Leion Hey glasses and you'll know what we mean). We’ve had a few users say AirCaps look like designer glasses. 
5. Convenience. You shouldn't have to go out of your way to use a product that gives you equal access. That means no dealing with cables connected to your phone &amp; draining your phone's battery like the XReal glasses. That also means having a battery life of more than 2 hours - our glasses last the entire day so you don't have to constantly recharge. This also means being able to use the product when you don’t have an internet connection - we have both an online and offline mode for captions
6. Specific features tailored to the use-case. No other product to our knowledge has real-time speaker separation - we can do this. Not only that, you can register voice profiles for each person you speak to based on just 10 seconds of audio and it will recognize and label that speaker. And, you can hide your own speech so you don't see redundant captions of what you are saying (unless you want that!). And you know how every speech recognition software messes up on proper nouns, names and technical terminology? Well, you can add custom vocabulary to our speech recognition to make sure it correctly recognizes these words. How did we know to add this stuff? We actually TALKED to DHH people in the community and asked them how they would design the product!
7. Complete privacy. We don’t store audio, transcriptions, or any other personal information ANYWHERE. The audio is immediately discarded after transcription, and you can’t export conversation transcripts. We care about your privacy. And if you think that’s not a big deal, HearView explicitly says in their Privacy Policy that they have the right to sell your information without informing you :)

We're happy to answer literally any question you have. We are also doing live video demos (you can book one on our website). We would love to hear comments about other products / this product / what you think about smart glasses in general - and we're super open to feedback, so if you think we're missing something important, please don't hesitate to tell us!

You can check out demo videos (through the lens) on our website as well as what others who have tried it have said about it. And feel free to DM us or email us ([aircaps@aircaps.com](mailto:aircaps@aircaps.com))!

TLDR: We're creating subtitle smart glasses specifically for the DHH community, co-designed with input from 500+ people, focusing on high accuracy, comfort, subtle style, convenience, and unique features like multi-speaker identification and custom vocab - features the community actually wants.",2024-10-29 20:01:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gf3yhj/subtitles_on_smart_glasses_but_actually_useful/

1ge3d7p,hardofhearing,Feeling like an asshole for calling myself deaf.,"
I've been hard of hearing my entire life, and was completely deaf in kindergarten until a month before my fifth birthday. 
I also have auditory processing disorder and am selectively mute, both are probably linked to my autism. 

All this leads to me having a very hard time when it comes to verbal communication. Especially when there's even just a bit of background noise, I can't understand spoken language at all anymore. At home this isn't much of a problem, since I live with four other people who have very similar issues. 

But when I'm out and I notice someone is trying to talk to me,   I panic every time. I usually can't understand them the first, second, or third time and it feels so awful asking a stranger to repeat themselves over and over again. 

I had a situation like this on Saturday again. I was standing in line in a grocery store and at some point noticed the man behind me was talking to me. I could understand only very little of what he said and was also unable to speak on my own at that moment. So I just looked at him, pointed at my ear and shook my head. 

When people I only know online ask me to voice chat with me or send me voice messages, unless I've known them for a long time and trust them, I usually say ""I'm sorry, I'm deaf"" since I am so embarrassed about the details of my hearing loss and other related issues. It's easier to get the point of ""I won't understand you"" across like this, than list the reasons and possibly come across as attention seeking or pity seeking or exaggerating. 

I feel kinda shitty for it, like it's somewhat unfair to people who are actually considered deaf on paper. Is this wrong, should I stop? What should I do instead? I'm kinda at loss. 

(posting this on two subs because it's kinda weighing me down a lot)",2024-10-28 14:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ge3d7p/feeling_like_an_asshole_for_calling_myself_deaf/
1gdpoff,hardofhearing,How Do You Feel About Using ASL in Public Spaces?,"Hey everyone! I’ve been thinking about how using ASL (or any sign language) in public spaces can feel a little different from speaking out loud, especially if people around us start watching. For me, I feel proud to sign, but I know sometimes it can draw attention, which can feel a bit awkward.

How do you feel about it? Do you feel comfortable signing in public, or do you sometimes prefer other ways to communicate? I’d love to hear your experiences—do you have any tips for handling curious looks or even questions from people?

Let’s talk about how we all handle signing in public spaces! 😊

[댓글]
I feel comfy with it but it took a few times to get past my body’s auto response to being looked/gawked at, which is turn beet red 🥴 Thankfully that’s stopped happening, ha! Now I just ignore bystanders, unless they’re being rude and I’m feeling spicy and then I’ll say something about them staring or whatever. 

I’ve discovered I actually feel more awkward when my friends and I use any combo of auditory sounds and sign. Usually signing to each other but maybe ordering coffee in english, or clapping to get the other persons attention, or something like that. I guess I still feel a bit weird or concerned about hearing people thinking we’re “faking” because we can hear a little or speak or access sound with devices or whatever silly stereotype they have about d/hh people that isn’t just “they can’t hear anything ever”. I’m working on breaking that anxiety down, though! And it’s by no means overwhelming.

I'm fine with it. I reason that humans are naturally drawn to movement, so it makes sense they'd gawk a bit. Though they shouldn't stare continuously if they're aware that staring for a really long time at someone is rude. 

I don't care if people are looking at me, especially if I can't see them myself. But I could imagine other people might have an issue with that.

I love it. It’s great if signing is seen. Hearing people need exposure to sign. Here in Europe most places are multi cultural, people do travel and work in different places. No one should be ashamed of using their language openly, it’s perfectly normal.

The situation I’d be cautious about is if I and the interpreter are signing and just chatting fore a meeting and my manager or someone else enters. It would be rude to exclude them, since they’re used to me talking. Then it might be a good idea to simcom for inclusion. For Deaf who only sign, that’s different of course.

Just beware that people might understand. You never know if someone has a Deaf connection or is in sign language classes. Never assume people don’t understand, so no gossip or comments about people in public.",2024-10-28 00:34:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gdpoff/how_do_you_feel_about_using_asl_in_public_spaces/
1gdjksk,hardofhearing,"It's been this way since I was old enough to remember because of a ton of hearing tests in grade school, etc.  Hearing aids only made the A/C across the building louder to me, they didn't help hearing people.  I realized how much I relied on lip reading when covid was a thing and everyone wore masks","I'm kind of down in the dumps right now.  I know people get frustrated at having to basically yell at me to hear what they say after two or three times, where I can at least get them to look at me and I can do my ""learned on the job"" lip reading.

I had a boss not too long ago (3-4 years the job paid shit anyway) just go off on me because she was so mad I couldn't understand when she mumbled.  It made me feel like I was doing something wrong.  I hate this impairment so much...

Unfortunately, there’s a lot of rude people out there . . . I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with their BS. Regarding hearing aids, I suggest you try a different audiologist for adjustment and/or newer hearing aids than the ones you currently own. There have been many recent, technological advances in blocking out background noise. You really shouldn’t have conversations routinely drowned out by AC background noise—though that was certainly a common issue with older model hearing aids. I’ve been wearing hearing aids over 30 years, and my early pairs were literally like listening to the world through a poor quality transistor radio. Things have definitely gotten better in that department. People, on the other hand, are still a work in progress . . .

I totally understand. But I’m curious how long ago you tried hearing aids and for how long? I got my first pair about two years ago and they have been truly life changing. They were really overwhelming at first but once I got used to them my brain learned to focus on voices and push other sounds to the background. My life is so much easier now.

I agree and relate to you so much. That was my childhood growing up, people yelling at me because they were frustrated. I've since learned to really play the disabled card (lol) early - Inform people that I am hard of hearing when I first meet them. 

Hearing aids are frustrating and I don't like wearing them HOWEVER I really notice the difference when I don't have them, I can't hear. 

Go see a good audiologist and get some GOOD hearing aids that are suited to your needs. Hearing aid technology has come such a long way from when I got my first pair 20 years ago. Give it another chance? Switch up the model and don't be afraid to tell people to stfu and calm their titties because they cant speak properly. Keeping in mind, you also need to advocate for yourself as unfortunately hearing loss is pretty permanent... 

Best of luck

I’m the same way- it never helped with things I was trying to hear. Just amplified annoying noises like wind. I can’t wear them. I get migraines and sensory overload",2024-10-27 19:50:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gdjksk/its_been_this_way_since_i_was_old_enough_to/
1gd4e8v,hardofhearing,Tympanoplasty: Is this normal?,"Hello all!

I have Meniere’s Syndrome. A rare inner ear disorder that causes very loud tinnitus, feeling of the ears being full (they are not, it’s the Cochlea), hearing loss, and very severe vertigo. 

Long story short, I ended up on a medical regime that has all but eliminated vertigo and most of the bad symptoms! Yay! My Meniere’s seems to (for now) be more advanced in one ear that has lost about 40% hearing while the other has been more mild and had lost basically nothing. 

Anyways, because of years and years of treatment that required intra and transatlantic shots and ear tubes, my ear drums developed some holes that would not close. Being that I don’t need steroid shots anymore, my ear doctor and I agreed to have a double Tympanoplasty to close up my ear drums holes. The idea was not that hearing would improve much, but at least being normalcy, prevent infections, allow for swimming, etc. 

I had my tympanoplasty 3 days ago…. And I can’t hear any outside noise. At all! Maybe  if someone screams super loud next to me I hear a little, but for all accounts all outside noises are muted! It’s driving me crazy. My wife called the doctors office twice and they say it’s the “packing” they put in my ears and that it will get better. Was that everyone’s experience too? I CAN hear my own voice very well and I hear chewing and swallowing and other internal sounds from my body. But I cannot hear almost ANYTHING from the outside. 

Normal?

Looking to see what others who had the surgery went through. 

[댓글]
The fact you can still hear internal sounds means your inner ear is still working and you're just experiencing conductive hearing loss. The packing can cause this and for some people (including myself when I've had ear surgery) your ear can fill with blood and you need to wait for that to drain before you can hear again.

Ok, you should make an appointment with an ent

Definitely recommend you see an ENT.

The symptoms you describe could be caused by earwax, that's 100% treatable.

But if it's not earwax, you'll then need the ENT to figure out what's causing your hearing loss, and then do a thorough hearing test. The results of the exam are given in a document called an audiogram-- make sure you get a copy! 

Then you'll have to make a decision about whether to get hearing aids, and if so, from who. Don't fall for a hard sell from the ENT-- there are other options.",2024-10-26 20:37:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gcubo7/feel_like_my_hearing_is_going_downhill_recently/

He will have to see what kind of phone they require him to use. My last job required I use an iPhone, I just uploaded a caption app. It helped a lot. On my personal phone, my hearing aids are automatically routed via bluetooth.  

Tell him to do a vibe check before he tells them. Some employers are turned off by hearing aids and look for other reasons not to hire us.

My work got in-line phone amplifiers for the clinics I work at. They work well and are easy to use.

1gbwz77,hardofhearing,How Has Captioning Helped You in Everyday Life?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to talk about captioning and how it’s helped us in different situations. For me, captions make a huge difference when I’m watching movies or videos—it’s like I’m finally in on the whole conversation! They also help a lot in online meetings or even when reading announcements in public places.

How about you? Have captions made life easier for you in certain ways? Maybe they’ve helped at school, work, or just in everyday activities? I’d love to hear your stories and how captioning has changed things for you!

Looking forward to reading your experiences! 😊

[댓글]
I'm HOH but my wife is not.  Since turning on captions on Netflix a few years ago, she appreciates them as much as I do.

I’ve been using closed captions for over 30 years. I have a profound loss so they’re pretty necessary for me. 

Automatic captions on my phone, zoom/teams etc have been the absolute game changer though. Now I can confidently make phone calls and it also helps me understand my family. It’s amazing.

On a practical level, they're helpful to me in literally all scenarios where they're a possibility, but a specific example that I really love talking about is the subtitles that accompany the directional microphone in the Metal Gear Solid video game franchise


The microphone is used to listen to enemies through walls and the audio will be louder or quieter depending on where the microphone is pointed - in the subtitles for these sequences, the text itself will get larger or smaller dynamically as you move to represent this as well, which I always thought was an incredibly cool way to give deaf audiences that gameplay mechanic without compromising on actually making them do the puzzle

I work remotely and I get super anxious if the captions don't load.

Captions absolutely help me too. I rely on them and sometimes my husband asks to turn them off because he finds them distracting. 

I saw a comedian recently and really wished after the fact that I had looked into captions at the venue. I wore my hearing aids but missed enough to be taken out of the moment. According to my hearing friend the comedian (Iliza) was mumbling and she missed some jokes too. I really worry about the increased risk of dementia later in life and am trying to stay diligent so I don’t check out of conversations any longer.

I’ve been using captions for many years. Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to watch anything. I also have Live Transcribe that I turn on when I want to have a conversation with someone. I use CaptionCall for all my calls. It’s really helpful because I have a transcript that I can refer back to if needed, like for appointments.

My live caption app is the only reason I passed Spanish during COVID

They help me immensely with movies/tv as you said and I’ve even thought of getting the captioning glasses for in person convos. They look super cool if they work well. I also completely stopped going to movie theaters because I was unaware of the captioning services and struggled too much to hear. Last year I went to Barbie when it came out and used the captioning thing that sits in your cup holder. It worked really well and I was happy to know I have the option of going to the movie theater again

I wouldn’t be able to work without Microsoft teams captions. 
Watch tv and movies with them on too!

Literally many scenarios as a person with hearing loss. I can understand phone calls &amp; in person conversations. Captioning apps like [Nagish](https://getapp.nagish.com/7Z9B/eojo3uc6) is so great for that reason as an example

Of course everyone loves captioning! 🤩

I’m very torn in how I feel about automated transcription, though. I work with technology l, and it’s impossible not to see the advantages of automated transcriptions. Nonetheless, I really like languages and take communication very seriously. There are so many shortcomings of automated transcription due to the algorithms not actually understanding the context in the way humans do, that it’s crazy. I feel sad about hearing people exposing us to accept those shortcomings. I very much prefer human interpreters and transcribers.

I also haven’t found a good app for automated transcription that works well for daily use. Mainly use MS Translator, but dislike the interface and that you cannot adjust text size.

Can’t live without them.

Subtitles on the telly didn't exist till around 1995, which meant telly didn't exist for me for the first 30 years of my life! I suddenly felt included in the hearing world when subbies arrived.

I find them helpful on social media and some tv/shows movies. Thankfully, imo, my hearing is generally ok so I’m usually catch everything first time (only one slightly low point at 1khz in my right ear but it’s mainly between 30-45 across the range so not really HoH. I’m getting a full assessment in two weeks which is great) 

It’s more a problem if the person has a deeper voice/lowers their tone or volume and that’s when I rely on increased volume and captions to know what is being said

I have meniere's disease. My experience with captions has been life-changing. They help me keep my attention on whatever I'm doing, they help me follow what's going on in TV and movies. They separate out the background sounds from the dialogue. I figured that if a thing doesn't have captions then it must not have been that important

They're great when I am on the bus and they have the text announcements with the audio ones, mainly in an unfamiliar area or it's dark outside. Same thing on trains but on buses they are still not always a thing where I live.

It also helps me with french listening comprehension when I use french subtitles so I am more able to understand people without them now (although it's still a struggle). 

I usually use them the most often when I didn't hear something multiple times no matter how many times I reversed the video so a caption is very helpful because I wouldn't not understand it. I hate not knowing what was said. 

I love reading song lyrics because I often struggle with understanding song lyrics without reading them, even from songs I've known since I was tiny. I love music.

I’ve been using captions on Zoom and it’s so helpful! If I miss just a word or phrase - there it is in the caption and I can catch up quickly without needing to ask.

I use the app nagish to caption my phone calls and its a game changer

I couldn't watch TV or film without it. Literally",2024-10-25 15:29:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gbwz77/how_has_captioning_helped_you_in_everyday_life/

[댓글]
This barely touches the hoh category. Yes hearing at the 0db line would be called “perfect” hearing but many doctors count normal hearing until 20dB loss or smth. 
If you benefit from them or not is up to you. Maybe just try a pair before buying them. Most acoustics let you try hearing aids before deciding which one or if. I would always suggest that. Most of the time it’s free of charge or covered by healthcare. After that you can decide for yourself

Very mild hearing loss in the low and high frequencies, normal hearing in the middle frequencies. The benefits from hearing aids would be minor, but depending on the cost and your resources you may find them worth it.

You hearing loss is very mild, as the other commenter said you probably wouldn’t find much benefit from hearing aids and depending on your age this bit of loss is very normal. Hearing aids can help preserve the hearing you have left and prevent tinnitus if you’re at risk of it but that’s no guarantee. You’d also likely struggle to get insurance to cover any costs for hearing aids for mild hearing loss like this. If it were me I would do my best to protect the hearing I have left by using ear protection in loud places and not listening to loud music and get hearing tests every couple years at least just to be sure. Unless there’s something interesting happening that would probably be enough to preserve what you have and you’ll adjust to such mild loss quickly.

0-20db is considered within normal ranges of hearing so given your results I’m not sure hearing aids would actually help.

I don't think you would benefit at all from hearing aids. This is extremely mild. If you find yourself especially struggling still, maybe talk to a doctor about audio processing disorders.",2024-10-23 15:58:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1gae1px/first_hearing_test_hoh/

1g9xbdf,hardofhearing,Ear still blocked,"Heya guys so I'm fully deaf in my left and partially deaf in my right. I wear hearing aid in my right ear. 

Two weeks ago I was pushing the tragus because it felt nice which created like a suction, then afterwards it got blocked. (Could feel the pressure) I know, I'm an idiot. I thought ""I'll put olive oil"" 

Later that night I suffered vertigo and booked appointment to see my doctor the next day. Which she thinks it could be wax next to my ear drum and told me to continue to use olive drops. The vertigo lasted 2/3 days. 

Tonight I managed to get the wax out, with combination of ear syringe and olive oil. (Used a camera to check inner ear) However my hearing is still blocked but it's not full. I'm thinking it's probably due to olive oil on my ear drum? 

I want to know what the best caught of action.   Should I stop using olive oil and see how it goes because I've been using it practically every day. 
  

[댓글]
The olive oil is definitely going to impact your hearing too - I get the same with ear drops or water in my ear.

Try taking a bath and let the ears marinate underwater for 30mins?  If all the wax is gone.  If that hurts I'm afraid that (not a doctor, just personal experience) the eardrum might have been damaged and better stop any contact with external matter and probably consulting is a good idea.  Other thing that comes to mind...pressure?  I'm freshly done with a cold that affected my ears and I regularly had to blow in my nose while clogging it to ""pop"" the ears (many people are extremely uncomfortable with this and it's generally not advised (again, not a doctor)...but I do it gently.

  
source: wearing 2 hearing aids since as long as I can remember.

Also this sounds weird as hell but what about plugging your nose and blowing like you’re blowing your nose. But with both nostrils closed.

I cry too when my feelings are hurt. I’m sorry they aren’t speaking up. 🫠😔 sometimes when I can’t hear someone it feels like I can’t breathe. I’m pretty dramatic. lol But it’s like a lack of recognition. Like you know I’m HoH but you continue to mumble or talk where I can’t hear you. It all feels so deliberate and it’s hard not to take it personal. I’m sorry I don’t have anything helpful to say. I just wanted to validate you and I hope you don’t feel alone. 🥺💙

You have every right to be hurt and upset. It is overwhelming to constantly have to remind people. You’re not alone in feeling like this and feeling the frustration of dealing with people who do this. Ugh…

I have pondered this myself and some people are just low talkers but then you throw in the self absorbed bunch, the ones who keep forgetting but mean well, the ones who just don’t know and the ones who could care less and you have basically what feels like a bunch of adults who really just don’t care if you hear them or not. It sucks and aside from constantly educating people (which gets tiring)I have yet to find a solution. On the other foot most people talk nonsense anyways so we probably aren’t missing much! LOL

You're valid for feeling this way, it does hurt. I try to surround myself with people that support me, but it's hard to do that with coworkers someimes. Family should always be willing to speak up, write it down or learn ASL. It just doesn't seem that hard to me. I learned that those sorts of responses are reflections on them not me.  

I will never understand adults that act that way.",2024-10-22 23:40:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g9wj3g/the_hurt/
1g8yo5w,hardofhearing,Hearing in background noise,"Hello everyone , i really need your help . I took a one gentamicin injection 160 mg for an UTI , and after 30 mins i felt pressure in my ears and started hurting a little , i noticed after that i struggle to hear in noisy places , even my voice can’t barely hear it when there is noise or when I’m watching TV at high volume and started to talk . I went to ENT and i did the audiogram and my hearing was perfect , i can hear up to 17khz and the quieter sounds without problem but once there is some noise i struggle to hear .
Now it’s been a month since i took the injection and the pressure in my ears still and also struggling to hear in background noise .
Are you guys you with hearing problems in noise also can’t hear your voice when you talk ?
And do you guys think that i can recover from this and the pressure will go or its permanent ?
Please if you can help i will really appreciate it , and sorry guys for my English it’s not my native language

Go back to the ENT. You might want speech audiometry testing in addition to tone audiometry.

Luckily your audio gram is perfect. Meaning cochlear is intact. I had the same problem as you. The gentamicin can disrupt the auditory cortex of your brain. You have drug induced audio processing disorder. Your hearing problem is inside your brain itself.

I have many, many many many encounters with this illness and I still make full recovery after many many months. The longest was about 2years. Still temporarily regardless. 

It can be difficult to cope in the meantime. But I can help you because I’m literally in the same boat RIGHzt NOW as you.",2024-10-21 19:39:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g8yo5w/hearing_in_background_noise/
1g8tswb,hardofhearing,APD,"Hello!
I’ve just returned from an hearing appointment where I’ve been told that as well as having a profound loss in my left ear to a severe to profound loss in my right ear that I also have auditory processing disorder. I am beyond frustrated. I’ve been hard of hearing since I was 6 years old. Worn hearing aids since forever (I’m 51) and have repeatedly told audiologists that I’m still not understanding speech at times no matter how loud someone speaks or rephrasing. I have been made to feel that I’m just not trying hard enough or it’s the hearing aids. So today I’m told “yeah you have central auditory processing disorder.” Nothing can be done about it… I’m exhausted and frustrated after years of dealing with this. What should my next steps be? I’m frustrated and everyone around me is frustrated by my hearing difficulties. ☹️

[댓글]
I am severe/profound deaf.   Maybe some APD as well. 

Have  Phonak  aids with the  strongest receivers, but  still have  some difficulty understanding some  people.

One thing to do , is  to ask people to  speak more slowly,  that  them speaking louder does not help.

That  should help with your  APD...

Lots of ENTs have no knowledge or experience of APD. I've been told to discuss APD with a speech therapist.

I wear hearing aids for my CAPD, and it helps with the hearing portion some, they weren't recommended when i was diagnosed 16 years ago so that's a recent thing. Back then, when I acquired CAPD from a head injury, I was just told to learn to read lips and get over it. Not much can help with the more learning disability side of it though. I've heard of some brain training programs out there but unsure of the efficacy.

unsure of your next steps beyond speaking to an audio who knows what they're doing. people misunderstand the clinical threshold needed for CAPD and think it is lower than it really is, and there's misinformation out there.

I was recently told I need to get Cochlear Implants.  I also have always had issues understanding what people are saying but my hearing tests have not been bad enough for CI’s, that is until a few weeks ago.  I’m going in for a consultation next week but I’m hopeful it will help, if I proceed with the process.",2024-10-21 16:23:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g8tswb/apd/

Should check out AMPHL, there’s a website and Facebook page/group. Association of Medical Professionals with Hearing Loss. Most members are US based but the international proportion is growing

not a physician, but in the medical field. agree with above, check out AMPHL. i’d also suggest trying different hearing aids from a different audiologist; hearing aids are only as good as the audiologist that programs them. my first experience was similar to you (loud, tinny, etc.) but with a different set of aids and programming i’ve had a much better experience.

the Innocaption app on your cell phone works pretty well.",2024-10-20 17:35:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g846li/any_us_hoh_physicians_here/
1g8226l,hardofhearing,What’s One Thing You Wish Hearing People Understood About Being Deaf or HOH?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to start a conversation about something I’m sure many of us have thought about—what’s one thing you wish hearing people understood about being deaf or hard of hearing? Whether it’s about communication, social interactions, or just everyday experiences, what’s something you feel they often miss or don’t realize?

For me, I wish more people understood that it’s not just about volume—speaking louder doesn’t always help, and context or clarity can be more important. Also, that constant effort to follow conversations can be really exhausting!

I’d love to hear what your experiences have been and what you wish people understood better. Let’s help spread some awareness by sharing our thoughts! 😊

[댓글]
It's just as frustrating for us when we have to keep asking you to repeat something.

Clarity. Clarity matters. I can hear enough to know that you're speaking, but I can't understand your words. 

And it matters which way your fucking head is pointing! Don't start talking to me and then turn around mid-sentence.

Deaf ≠ 100% loss of hearing

Speech deficits don’t mean I have a developmental disability 

Closed captioning means I can participate in entertainment, too, it’s not taking anything away from your experience 

If I repeat what you’ve said, it’s to make sure we are both on the same page 

If you repeatedly make fake hand gestures at me, you’re going to find out what my hands can do

“Trying harder” doesn’t mean I can understand you better. If what I’m hearing is the adults in a Peanuts cartoon it’s not going to become more clear when I try harder.

That’s exactly what I would say too! Don’t yell at me! Just enunciate please! And holy crap I told my office just this past month that I can’t keep up with the group conversations so I just choose to keep working and not participate and people tell me I’m too quiet. 
I’ve had to remind people that they need to get my attention first and at least look towards me and not talk to their monitor. 
More hearing people need to understand that a lot of us HOH rely on lip reading. 
Basically “look at me when you’re talking to me and enunciate for everyone’s forsaken sanity PLEASE.”

1. Speak clearly and face me. If you’re walking in front of me and talking there’s 100% guarantee I’m not going to hear/understand you. 
2. Don’t mumble or speak super quickly. If I tell you I’m hard of hearing and can’t understand what you’re saying - ESPECIALLY on the phone - that doesn’t mean speaking more quickly is going to help. (This literally happened the other day and I had to put my phone on speaker so my wife could decipher what the person was saying.) 
3. Just because I wear HAs doesn’t mean I can actually make out what you’re saying, especially in loud places like a restaurant. Or if you’re walking in front of me and talking. 
4. That there are days where hearing is overwhelming and we just need the world to be quieter, so we remove our HAs.

1. No, you can’t try my hearing aids on. I cannot tell you the number of FULLY GROWN ADULTS that want to try them on. (A former friend had a MELTDOWN because i wouldn’t let her try them)

2. Those hearing aids you see in Walmart are not what my ENT and audiologist rec comment for my level of hearing loss. 

3. You are not qualified to give “advice”  or “test” my hearing. 

4. I  need my hearing aids, they aren’t a crutch and you cannot cure me. 

5. I’m not ashamed of my hearing aids or being hard of hearing. If you’re ashamed or think I should be…that’s a YOU problem.  


It’s really a respect thing for me. It’s common sense. Human decency.

Saying ‘never mind’ when we didn’t hear or understand you is infuriating!

That it’s not just an elderly issue. I got my first hearing aids at 22.

1. Being hoh doesn't mean I'm dumb. 

2. Face me so I can read your lips. 

3. If it's important enough to say the first time. It's important enough to let me understand.  

4. Speak slowly and clearly. Especially if you have an accent, or a soft voice. 

5. Ennounciate!

6. Closed captioning doesn't hurt you. But makes whatever we are watching accessible to me. 

7. Still not stupid. Just hoh.

That hearing aids aren't like glasses, my dude. You can pop your glasses on and they do a pretty good job at correcting your vision. You might need extra help for small text or whatever but generally glasses take you from *I can't see* to *I can see!*

Hearing aids don't do that. Sure, they help to magnify the sounds you can't hear as well, but if your ears don't work then they simply don't work. Those calcified lil bones don't suddenly transmit the sound any better. Nerves don't magically begin to work. BAHAs and Cochlear implants are marvellous things but they still rely on human parts of you and don't *magically* fix anything the way glasses do.

And also, if I can't see you, I can't hear ya! It's amazing how rude hearing people are to each other, nevermind to us. Why would you begin a conversation with anyone who hasn't realised you're there yet? Why would you cover your mouth when speaking to somebody? Why mumble? Hearing people do it to everyone, not just us.

thiizziswhaddihearrrifyousoundboreedanddontenunciaatee

Pronounce the spaces between words. Enunciate. For everybody else too, but for me especially. Please. I'm so much more annoyed than you are.

Having to listen in a multi-sound environment *drains* the life out of me. Please don't make me request that we go to a quiet place for the 100th time, meet me halfway and just remember. If we've been friends for X years, don't play music at max volume just so I have to ask for the billionth time for reasonable accommodations. It's humiliating.

Don't say ""Oh I'm hard of hearing too, sometimes I have trouble hearing my friends at nightclubs and loud bars."" It's patronizing.

That it’s not our fault that we can’t hear

""Volume is not the same as clarity"" is the biggest one for me. And also, just because I have CIs doesn't mean I can hear normally. They do a pretty good job, but they don't compare to 100% normal, natural hearing.

And when I say I have hearing issues, please don't say, ""What?"" If I had a dollar for every time I heard that one, I could retire. It was mildly amusing the first time, but not the 100th.

Stop turning your head and looking around mid-sentence

Same as a lot of others here:

1) don't just speak louder, speak clearly and try to say the same thing with different words. Sometimes the pattern of certain words one after another is hard to decipher if they have tones I struggle to hear.

2) if I repeat back to you part of a message and need you to repeat, I don't want your whole paragraph repeated--just the words I couldn't hear. Don't recite your whole monologue again, just the part I couldn't get.

3) I won't hear you in another room. I likely won't hear you if you're not facing me and directly talking to me.

Whenever I relay to people that I am totally deaf in my R ear..the major response is "" oh, that's ok""..maybe for you, not me. Occasionally,  I do say that to them, but the subtlety escapes most people. I don't  know why, it just annoys me..

Sigh. 
Agree with so many things that have been said already. 
I’ll add…

The fact that I’ve followed 90% of a conversation and want 10% clarified does not mean that I’ve not heard / not understood / am hiding the true extent of my hearing loss

I have good days and bad days. 

Please accommodate me by popping subtitles on. I rely on them now. Don’t make me ask every single time.

That ‘nevermind, it wasnt that important’ is the most annoying thing. It was important enough to say it in the first place!

Yelling at me won’t make me understand what you said.

That yes I can be HoH at 26, its not an ‘old people thing’

Talking loud and fast doesn't mean we will hear you. It makes us anxious. Speaking clearly at normal volume and speed and making eye contact works fine with us. If you think we are unable to hear you, type on your note app or send a text instead.
I've got a few great friends who take it seriously and didn't even need to tell them as if they were already prepared how to talk to an HOH. Once, I was with my bf and his friends, and they were talking and joking about something that I didn't get; my bf explained to me what they were talking about and the context behind the jokes as well so patiently while his friend patiently waited for us. My other friends, whenever we are in crowded places, they send me texts.
However, people aren't patient enough most the times, they lose their cool and get aggressive, which really makes our social life really hard and isolated sometimes.

Stop mumbling. Like holy shit

I hard for us to control/know how loud we get while speaking

The golden rules…get my attention, face me and be within 6 six feet.

Volume isn’t the key, clarity and enunciation count.

I think the most interesting thing was when I was doing some hearing rehab, I have a CI, and my husband realized that certain sounds were more difficult than others. Each and every word is different, geez, different from each and every person. 

It’s challenging, exhausting and often frustrating. Be patient and work with me for understanding….

Look/face me when you’re talking to me! Please for the love of goddddd don’t get pissed at me when you know I’m HOH and continue to ask you to look at me when you speak so I have a bit more to work with when conversing with you

I struggle in group conversations to keep up.
I look moody but it's my concentration face.
I rely heavily on lip reading and will stare at you.
I have very limited awareness of surrounding conversations, so just because I am in the room, does not mean I heard what you were talking about.
Saying ""nothing"" or ""never mind"" is not funny and is actually insulting.
Hearing fatigue is a real thing and can be hard work in dim lighting or background noises.

That not ask hearing loss is the same: talk to me about what I need and don't need, rather than assume, please! (Or in addition to assuming...I don't mind the initiative at all! But my hearing loss is very different from my co-worker's and what works well for him may not work well for me).

Yes! You can be as loud as you want; I still won't hear the consonants correctly if at all. Just look at me or experience the polite, vague smile and nod  as I walk away. Just look at me. Yes, I can usually get a good idea of what your saying, but please don't make me. It's exhausting. 

If you have a bushy mustache, sorry. I can't read your lips so I'm going to confirm *everything* you said.

Not all deaf people have speech issues.  My hearing loss is adult-onset, so I can speak perfectly clearly.  But that does not mean I can hear you.  
Soooo many people assume I am lying about not being able to hear just because THEY can understand what I am saying.

T a l k i n g   R i di c u lo u s l y   S l o w    W I L L  I n c r e a s e   t h e   C h a n c e   o f   G e t t i n g   P u n c h e d

  
Also hearing and IQ have no correlation

If you tell me something that’s very important, don’t assume that I heard it. Get confirmation from me that I heard it and understood it. Otherwise, you didn’t say it.

EDIT: My username should have been OldBlindHOHMan. But I figured too many people wouldn’t get what HOH meant.

I can rarely get someone to clarify just a part of a sentence. I'll say, what was the part after ""identifiable phrase?"" And here we go, we all get to start over. Sometimes they'll turn away or mumble the same part I missed the first time 😭. 

I think people who communicate freely almost don't even know what they're saying. It's just spilling out. I need to be hyper attentive even when you're just thinking aloud.



Also, I still don't know how to react to this. When I try to communicate that I have a need and say I'm hard of hearing, then the person says, oh yeah I'm so deaf, like it's no big deal. I always think, are you?

I'm not ashamed, you don't need to tell me it's okay. I'm just letting you know because I think it might matter and help us both over the next hour or two. 

Should I clarify? Should I advocate for them to not ignore their hearing loss? Do they know that I'm wearing hearing aids? Are they? 🤣 Like bro, let's be HoH friends! How often are people saying this when they don't actually have hearing loss? It's so much more common than people think I honestly want to be like, ok but have you talked to a doctor about it? But that feels like over stepping.

So many of mine have been said already except one that really irritates me. 

Closed Captioning. If something is said in the audio in another language put it in the CC don’t just put “speaks Spanish” or “speaks foreign language”. If a Spanish speaker can understand it without CC then a Spanish speaker should be able to understand it reading CC too. CC is used all the time by all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons - this just makes it more comprehensible for everyone.

That people say they don’t judge but they do. They might not say it to your face but I know.

My wife is thin skinned and takes these types of comments as criticism. What’s worse is when she’s on a call using ear buds her enunciation and volume are far better. We do well at dinner sitting across from each other at home but in restaurants it’s not a lot of fun. 
Getting together with her family is a challenge because they are very loud so much so I have to reduce my HAs volume

It takes so much effort to have a conversation because I can't understand what you're saying without putting in a ton of work. It's exhausting. So please, for the love of god, stop yapping on and on about unimportant things. 

I don't care what your dog had for breakfast or how long it took you to get a stain out of your carpet or how your kid whom I've never met has a new dress. I HAVE to save my energy for listening to patrons, following instructions pertinent to work, and being aware of our surroundings. When you yammer on about things that don't need to be said, it drains me so fast and then I can't properly do my job!

Don’t make fun of me for being a “loud talker” and act like I’m annoying for talking so loud. I don’t always pick the right volume for the situation and don’t realize that I might be talking a little too loud.

Also that I can’t hear you if you talk to me while I’m eating because the sound of myself chewing means I can’t hear what you are saying. This is why I end up eating soooo slowly because I have to stop eating to hear what my coworkers are saying to me.

Wait you can speak normal! *pikachu face* 

I get that people why people are surprises by it, because of the stereotype image they have of deaf and HoH people. But yeah most of us can talk :)

How uncomfortable Hearingaids can get or how overstimulated we get from loud noises

That turning the volume uo doesn't make things any clearer. Now its just muffled, louder.

I learned that every thing I do as a hearing person seems to miscommunicate alot by body language alone. I was sitting in a bar and talking and laughing with friends around, 1st time in this dimly litted place and the guy next to my boyfriend said something that wasn't able to be conveyed to him right away and I don't know if its was a just a feminine gesture to cover your mouth when eating or laughing at times I forget and he got so mad because he thought I was talking and laughing with the dude sitting next to him. He broke up with me and would not take any explanation but I was upset because he didn't give me enough time to explain and he got mad and said that I don't know how to communicate with him. So I am really trying hard to understand where I went wrong aside from the obvious. But never cover my mouth argument is worthy to avoid no matter what.

Just how much it has limited my ability to socialize, do certain sports or hobbies. How lonely it is.

Here's the thing about speaking louder vs clearer: In general, speaking louder increases the volume of the vowels.  But the vowels are already the loudest sounds.  It's those quiet, shy consonants that I can't hear.  When you enunciate, you increase the volume of the consonants &amp; i have a much better chance of hearing you.

This thread may not change the hearing world, but it makes my world so much better knowing i'm not alone.  Thank you all!

I can’t hear individual voices against background noise well, and yet people talk to me while facing away or while looking down or in low tones like I can hear whispers with road noise. I’m talking about people who know I have trouble with this. I have to ask them to say it again, which annoys me both because I need to ask and because they’re not thinking that maybe they should talk to me if they want to talk to me.

That I can’t hear them or much of what is happening, that’s about it lol

When we say what or pardon, please repeat exactly what you just said, not explain what you meant. I'm not an idiot, I just didn't hear you.

Don’t mind if we want to sit a particular way. I hear from my right ear and I need to always sit in a particular spot to hear everyone.

When there's a bunch of loud noises at once or I'm trying to understand something over background noise in a chaotic place I get so overwhelmed and overstimulated. I might get a bit irritable or just completely check out of whatever is going on. It's also so exhausting and draining to socialize for extended periods of time, because my brain has to work so hard to keep up.

Hearing aids, cochlear implants, etc, are not a simple easy fix or a one size fits all. Yes, they help but that doesn’t negate that I still struggle and have to put so much energy into following along in a simple conversation. 

This might be personal to me, but I hate when people say hearing impaired it makes me feel like something is broken or that there is something wrong with me. I’d much rather you say hard of hearing or deafness when referring to my disability

Just because I'm HOH, doesn't mean I'm not bothered by certain sounds.

When i am pissed that i dont hear and i ask few times other person to repeat and then they go like ""nevermind"" ,sometimes feeling annoyed that i don't understand.Like it's not worse for you than me,isn't it?

There isn't only voice to communicate, you can write down or even add gestures, doesn't have to be facial expression along your voice, 2 inputs are better than one and we can switch to what we understand better and it helps GREATLY about context.

Also I keep expressing my struggles to hearing people this way : imagine a multi-level fill in the blanks situation - at the letter level, causing blanks at the syllabic level, causing blanks at the word level, causing blanks at the context level...add to that the uncertainty of being sure we understand..and other potential issues...

I've worn hearing aids since I was a few months old. Moderate-severe in both ears. Normal annoying shit like people thinking you can lip read, the telephone game, etc.

Getting up for work is so stressful. Like... I can't use my phone alarm. I have those bed shaking sonic boom ones but if you have a partner... that is not a pleasant way to wake up lol. 

And the batteries....

God,  the batteries. They're EVERWHERE.

You could check with vocational rehab about trying/getting an electronic stethoscope. They’re pretty expensive but im pretty sure most are compatible with hearing aids. Vocational rehab might be able to help with the cost or your work should cover it as an accommodation for you.

would it be possible to put the sethoscope directly at the hearing aid microphone to pick it up through amplification?

InnoCaption

I've got a Samsung phone and there's live captions already installed, it's under accessibility menu. I'm sure apple and pixel have it too.

Caption call mobile, it’s free app

InnoCaption is great

Nagish! You can even link your normal phone number to it so you don't need to use theirs. I also can't understand anything on the phone and don't even have to tell people I have hearing loss when I use Nagish.

Also just a reminder that if your HAs are Bluetooth compatible you can stream your phone through them.  I find it hard to understand people on calls without using BT, but BT makes it soooo much easier to understand them.

I cannot understand calls unless I hear them in stereo in my hearing aids via blue tooth.  Otherwise it's text only

If you have an iPhone turn on the captions!! It’s a game changer. I have the side button on my phone set to turn the captions on / off. Works for all apps/calls/live captions.

I’m using CaptionCall. It works really good for me

CaptionMate is really good and free to use you do have to make the calls through the app but it’s helped me tremendously

I use Caption Call for calls.

Most of these work very much alike:

- InnoCaption
- CaptionMate
- CaptionCall
- ClearCaptions Mobile
- RogerVoice
- Nagish

Give them all a try and see which one works best for you.

1g67e6r,hardofhearing,New coworker,"Hi,

So I have a new co-worker. But has a bushy mustache and bushy beard. Mustache not trimmed, so I cannot read lips. How do I communicate with this co-worker?

text. teams/skype. Discord. pen/paper. Don’t be shy informing them that you’re deaf or HoH and that you may use other means to communicate.

Hi there! I also went through this struggle before. The girl I was working with barely moved her lips while talking and it was very difficult for me to understand what she was saying and it almost felt like Ventriloquism. And nobody in my office knew ASL so I was trapped. Then one day I was scrolling through Instagram and stumbled upon this app called Live Transcribe Pro. It was better than all the apps I've used before. It had a very user-friendly surface and was very easy to use. I approached her and told her the difficulty I was having and she was super cool about it I used the app whenever I was with her and till i left the office for a better opportunity, we were best buds. So I suggest you talk to them, and say that you're having some difficulty reading lips. I think they will understand you.",2024-10-18 02:01:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g67e6r/new_coworker/

1g5yi2w,hardofhearing,Assisted Listening Device Server,"I'm trying to find a low/no cost solution to add an ALD to an event space. The options I've looked out are the ListenEverywhere and AudioFetch Express 5/Signature. I was wondering if there might be a software solution I could use that would add the same capabilities with the same No Internet access required functionality of those two previous devices. I have several SFF mini PCs that I could use to run the software and a simple wifi network already. I thought maybe a VLC stream might be able to handle this or some other software, but I'm unsure of the latency and I guess I would have to figure that out.

The venue doesn't have a lot of funds and doesn't bring in a lot of money either. It's run as a benefit for the people who come for entertainment. This is just a personal pursuit in trying to add something extra for the older people who do come.

Well, a VLC stream might work if I could actually get it to run on a smartphone. I could start the stream and I could load the stream from another computer or from the localhost, but I couldn't load the stream from my smartphone with VLC installed or from a web browser. The latency on localhost to localhost stream to player latency was almost a full second it sounded like. I've found a program called Icecast and Darkcast, but they require a Linux install so I'm running a VM of Linux on my windows PC and following an install guide. I'll see how that goes and see if it offers better latency.

1g5tdd5,hardofhearing,Hearing aids in rain and roller coasters,"Hello. I am 21 and have had hearing aids for a while, but I live in an entirely hearing community and have not had any connection to or community with any other people with hearing loss like mine. (Nice to meet you all by the way, I am new here).

So far, I have just been keeping my hearing aids off if I go out in the rain. I live in a desert, so it is not typically an issue for me to just remove them and slip them in a little container to keep them dry. However, I will be moving somewhere a lot rainier soon, and worry for my hearing aids' safety in bad weather.

Does anybody have any tips or products on what you are supposed to do when it rains?

(My audiologist told me how to use the hearing aids, not how to live daily life with them ^^; so i have been making everything up as i go along.)

While i am here, i was also wondering what you do (especially young adults) when doing things like riding roller coasters? Typically I just leave my hearing aids at home if i know we will be doing things like that, but seeing as my family and friends are all hearing and not typically willing to accommodate for my hearing loss (signing with me or making sure i know when they are talking or turning towards me so I can lip read, etc) it is not ideal to not have them. But I have had surgeries that make it a little easier for them to fall out. So I can't risk leaving them in. Thoughts?

Thank you in advance! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

[댓글]
There’s a company called DeafMetal that makes really cool jewelry that tethers your hearing aids to your ears. I wear them mountain biking, because I have had hearing aids fall out before and I would never find them on the trail! That would work for roller coasters. And they look great!

As for rain, I’d check the manual for your HAs. They should be fine. I got a little drier from Amazon that I use for mine after I get home.

I forgot to take my hearing aid out when riding VelociCoaster at Universal Studios. I found it tangled in my hair after the ride. So thankfully I didn't lose it! But I'll definitely be taking it out in future. I wear it in the rain all the time though without any problems.

I am an older dude, was taught to always take off my hearing aids when it rains, and always took them off for rollercoasters and physical activity. Was more worried about a side impact while they were in my ear, but sweat was also a concern. I used to use a hard case that was provided by my audiologist but these days I just use a generic airpods or earpro case. If you can get cargo/golf pants or shorts etc. with a zipper pocket that's probably the best way to avoid losing them at a theme park

I've just always had something on hand to cover my head when it rains. If it's raining more than a sprinkle and I don't have a rain hat or hood, I turn my hearing aids off and put them in a zippered pocket. 

I think they've got better waterproofing than they used to, but I would NOT trust any hearing aids to be worn in more than a sprinkle. 

I haven't had an issue with them on roller coasters. My hearing aids stay on WAY better than my glasses do and I've never lost those at an amusement park. I wouldn't wear them for high intensity daredevil activities but I don't do that anyways.

I live in Portland, OR and it rains A LOT. I don’t ever worry about my HAs in light rain if I’m just out running errands and not constantly out in the rain. Even a heavier rain, if I’m just running from the parking lot into the grocery store I don’t really worry about it. 

If I’m going to be walking my dog out in the rain I always wear a jacket with a hood, so my ears are generally protected. Although if the weather is particularly nasty and we HAVE to go out, I just won’t wear them. 

FWIW I used to have shoulder-length hair (very thick too), and that did a decent job of covering my ears and protecting my HAs in light rain. I have a pixie cut now, but I don’t know that my HAs have ever been in danger from the rain. Oh, and, we attended a rainy outdoor wedding in June and we were outside for the ceremony for 30+ minutes. My HAs were totally fine in steady light-ish rain. 

The only time I’ve ever really worried about water was when I’ve jumped in the shower and forgotten to remove them. But even then there’s been no harm done. I wear Oticon Opn S2 RITE rechargeable HAs.

Do you have also issues with wind? Or it's mainly rain/humidity?

Another place that sells protective covers for the rain and cords to keep them from getting lost is Gear for Ears. [https://www.gearforears.com/](https://www.gearforears.com/)

With analog aids, I wasn't too worried about them getting wet. Once they dried out they were fine again. Those were bulletproof. When those were no longer available and I had to switch to digital, now they were so sensitive and easily could be damaged by moisture. If I was out, I usually had on a wide-brim cowboy hat. Even in pouring rain it kept them dry. I'm too deaf for HAs now though so I no longer use them.

Have a talk with your family that they need to do a better job at accommodating you and leave your hearing aids at home. I’m a huge fan of rollercoasters but it’s not worth risking losing $6000 hearing aids.

I leave mine in for regular rain but when it’s heavy I will take them out and pop them in their case in my pocket. I don’t really ride rollercoasters but if I did I’d do the same then, mine came in a hard case so I’d just pop it in a zipped pocket.

i live in a rainy/snowy ish city and the best solution i found is to always carry an umbrella in my purse because i dont like to take them out since it makes it harder for me to communicate with hearing people around me, if the rain or snow is too heavy and then i just put on a hoodie to better protect them alongside with my umbrella! No advice for rollercoasters tho :(

Not sure if anyone's mentioned this yet but I use eargear. I work outside and in a very rainy climate, especially in this upcoming season. Eargear is a fabric cover that isn't totally waterproof, but makes me feel much more protected. Good for dirt and debris too, as I work around that too. 
In addition, I usually wear a waterproof bucket hat :) 

https://www.gearforears.com/

Why would you be standing in the rain with your hearing aids in? I don’t know. If I have to be in rough weather I just put my hearing aids in my case and use my AirPods Pro with live listen. I can’t imagine ever being in it for very long.",2024-10-17 15:20:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g5tdd5/hearing_aids_in_rain_and_roller_coasters/
1g5gixl,hardofhearing,Anyone learnt sign language to cope with difficulties?,"Title, anyone learnt SL and did it have a positive affect on social encounters? I am having a tough time rn with hearing conversations and dealing with feelings of being on the outside, looking for solutions as I feel that being HoH is making it too difficult to keep up with conversations at my work and I’m unable to join in…

[댓글]
Im working on this with my partner. He and I are using it to communicate in public places. For example, I’ve learned how to sign that I didn’t hear someone and ask him to explain it to me.

[deleted]

I am in the process of learning right now, since my hearing deteriorated to a degree where like you mentioned, it is hard to keep a conversation going, feels like I'm always on the outside of a conversation and a lot of hearing people are unable to cope or accommodate.

What I found helpful is using a transcription app in social settings as well. I know it's cumbersome but it's just another tool to help me be part of the conversation, even if it doesn't work 100% of the time.

We just need to use whichever tools we've got at our disposal.

ASL has given me a huge community and a sense of belonging. It’s very worth it and makes communicating so much easier when in groups who use it. Biggest problem is most of my friends are hearing and don’t sign.

Sure! It’s the best thing I ever did, and can only wish I had the opportunity to do so sooner.

Sign languages are just regular languages. Don’t expect fluency. Don’t have deadlines. Just take signing for what it is and get it into your life. Figure out how to enjoy learning, and approach learning with curiosity. You need to find ways to get signing into your life, and that’s a life long journey.

Yes I’ve been learning to sign and I love it. I wish literally anyone in my family would learn to sign for me

Yes! Best decision of my life!


I love BSL and I love the community around it. It has opened doors for me that I never even knew existed.

I LOVE signing!!!

Ear strain is a bitch. It physically hurts my head to have to try my best to hear people when I literally can’t. And lip reading is a life saver, but it doesn’t always work (sometimes the person isn’t facing you the whole time or has weird facial hair or it’s a lecture of some kind and you are sitting behind someone tall, etc.)

But SL makes it *so much easier.*
- No ear strain.
- No lip reading.
- Just clear and pure communication.
- Without the weird language barriers.
Nobody really talks about how awful it is to have language barriers with **your own first language** when you have hearing loss, but it sucks big time. Signing removes all of that and is a million times less exhausting.

Cons to SL:
Mostly just the fact that if your experience and (lack of) support system is anything like mine, nobody is going to learn it for you. But that isn’t the case with everybody. A lot of people find that when they start getting fluent in SL, others in their life jump at the opportunity to learn either because they think it’s interesting or because they would like to support you. So many people have actually come to me (because i am fluent) so they can learn how to sign in order to communicate with other people in their lives who are deaf or hard of hearing. If you have people in your life who are that supportive, I’d say the chances are likely that they will learn it beside you and it would be a great resource for you.

Funny story: The only person who learned it for me is my brother, who only learned mostly just the swear words so we can tell each other that we look like shit from across the room. He did technically learn a lot more, he just forgot all of it besides the swear words. (At least he is trying lol)

Overall, I personally think it is 100% worth it. :)
Why not expand your resources for your own disability?

I don't want to discourage you from learning asl, but I will say that for me it was not the solution I was hoping it would be. So yes, explore it, but don't expect it to be an easy fix. 

I wasn't really able to get any friends or family as hyped about it as I was, so it didn't benefit me in conversations with them (they'd get excited at first and make big promises, but would lose interest after learning 5-6 words).

Level 1&amp;2 classes connected me with hearing students who were serious about trying to learn, but I couldn't learn much from practicing with them bc we'd just amplify our misunderstandings. The only way to really improve beyond basic vocab is to practice with fluent signers. 

I found it very hard to get ""in"" with the Deaf community, and when I did manage to come across Deaf people we didn't necessarily have anything else in common-- just being deaf or hoh sparks a little conversation, but it doesn't mean you'll become best friends. Deaf people are so fast at it too, so I felt even more left out in those circles than I did in hearing conversations. 

Is it a skill worth having? 100% yes. Will it help you instantly gain full access to information, fit in, and feel accepted? Unfortunately no.

I am starting to learn it on life print with Bill vicars. I am getting deafer so I'm starting early. I haven't had a chance to use it irl yet",2024-10-17 02:22:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g5gixl/anyone_learnt_sign_language_to_cope_with/
1g522cy,hardofhearing,Patched Tympanic Membrane,"Hey everyone! 

Back in August I severely damaged my ear drum with a q-tip. I lost most of my hearing in that ear almost immediately. 

I was followed by an ENT for a couple of weeks who believed that there was no way this injury would heal on its own. 

He referred me to another ENT to see if he believed it could be repaired. 

About 6 weeks after the injury (end of September), I had a procedure completed. I was never told the name of it, but I believe it to be similar to a myringoplasty. The hole in my tympanic membrane was patched with synthetic graft material and sandwiched between two pieces of Gelfoam. This was completed with only local anesthetic. 

He told me that I should be fine to fly the end of October (approximately one month post procedure). However, I am still nervous about this. I’ve done a pile of research and will try all the tips that I’ve found. 

My hearing is still quite poor in that ear. It’s certainly improved some, but not as much as I would have thought. 

The last couple of days, I’ve felt a slight movement of air as well on that side. That’s making me think that the seal is not complete and maybe the graft failed. 

The earliest I can get in to see the ENT is the end of November. 

I guess I’m just looking for any advice about it my flight and or similar situations with respect to healing after that kind of procedure. Any information is welcome. I don’t know anyone personally who has gone through this, so I’m glad I found this sub.

1g4zchp,hardofhearing,Are the hearing loss simulators accurate for you?,"Do you feel that they can present the levels of hearing loss well?

[댓글]
I have no idea as i don’t know what things are supposed to sound like 😂

I can't tell if the original level is supposed to be correct, but in general no. 

Everything just gets more muddled and quieter in the simulators, which isn't my experience. I experience my life in higher frequencies because I can't hear the lower ones, sort of like the low frequencies are just being replaced by higher ones. 

It's not muddled at all, everything's so loud that my speech recognition is nonexistent. (Aka the loudness/environmental noise is what makes it muffled in the first place)

I do have an atypical hearing loss, so it may be different for other people.

This is best one:

[https://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-mining/HLSimWeb](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-mining/HLSimWeb)

I can't tell because I'm listening to them with hearing loss. I can't tell if they sound like my hearing loss to people without hearing loss, because I have hearing loss. Hearing aids don't work for me at this point, so I can't pop in hearing aids and listen to them with closer to normal hearing to see if they compare to what I hear.

In seventh grade music class, we talked about hearing loss and were given audios of what different levels of hearing loss, and also chronic tinnitus, sound like. I couldn't hear half them and couldn't tell the difference between the other half lol. Nobody knew I was HOH and had that chronic tinnitus back then, and I didn't speak up, but it was kinda funny sitting there like ""ah yes this is totally a new experience for me, totally not everyday life, I can totally hear this, yeah!""

nah, I have CAPD and struggle to find a good simulation for that.

1g48bfq,hardofhearing,Got my HA Today!,"Phonak Audeo 90. Holy cow. Everything is so LOUD. I'm at 85% prescription. I can hear myself chew. The keyboard and mouse clicks. My footsteps. Any advice for getting through these next few days while my brain adjusts?

[댓글]
Yeah it is too much of a good thing sometime. Chewing sound, ambulance, farts and people talking shit about you...

It can be overwhelming.
I suggest you lower down the volume by 20% to make it more gentle.

Take listening breaks.  I also created programs that dim sound somewhat.  I created one for coffee shops, essentially pulled down all non-essential pitches on the equalizer.  I narrowed the mic focus as much as possible.  On my break at work, I can play soft music to mask people talking by using Bluetooth plus mic and setting ambient to zero.  

I'm still getting sound, obviously.  But the ability to control or just dim sound helps quite a lot.  I'm not sure why, but adjusting the volume on my HAs isn't super helpful. Perhaps it's because I have open domes and they leak sound quote a bit.

Do try to wear them though. Especially when you go to a store or anyplace you can hear voices. You’ll be picking up more of conversations than you expect, and your ears will adjust and make better use of what you’re hearing 

Ive had a pair for just about a month now. Still getting used to them, but they make a difference and the longer I wear them the more I forget I have them on.

Wear them for short periods of time to begin with. And definitely turn the volume down a couple clicks, then slowly turn it back up to the level you need. I had shoulder surgery back in April, and was in too much pain to wear my hearing aids for about 2 weeks. When I put them back in, I felt completely overwhelmed, and had to take them out after half an hour. I slowly worked back up to wearing them, and then they were comfortable again.

It's easy to get overwhelmed when you have new HAs. 

It's best to leave them in all day to help your brain adjust, but if it's too much, lower the volume two or three steps, wait a few minutes, then slowly bring it back up again.

If it’s particularly noisy, lower the volume temporarily. That’s much better and helpful than removing the hearing aids.

Does meditation or deep breathing
Help? 

Turn the volume down. My audiologist told me it was very important to wear them as much as possible and she also programmed them lower and told me to turn volume down when i started feeling overwhelmed. I went back to my one month appt yesterday and we are back to “normal” already as to where Widex wants it set. She mentioned 1-4 (?) and I was at 2. We went to 4 yesterday. 
Your brain will adapt and you might need to up your self care in the meantime- it’s a lot! Hang in there!!

It is a good idea to not keep hearing aids in 100% of the time during the first few days. You can overwhelm yourself, and also your ears. I would them out or lower the volume to give yourself breaks throughout the day until you are comfortable me with them.

My audiologist worked near the freeway, so when I got mine for the first time I was so overwhelmed by all the many car noises on the way home that I took them out for most of the trip.

Also, if the sounds continue to bother you, it is always ok to go back and talk to your audiologist about it and they can work on adjusting them for you until the sound level is at comfortable levels for you. It does not have to stay exactly where they put it the first time.

Congratulations by the way! ^-^

I don't know what you had before, but when I got my actual HA, it took me about 3 months to feel comfortable with them with all the new stuff.

  
My advice : take notes.  What do you feel could be improved and what do you think you DON'T need to hear?  Ex: aeration noises, traffic noises, compression are things I asked to remove, asked to adjust the dynamism of the sound bubble (like when you talk to someone, it recognizes human voices and cuts the rest off but initially the size of the bubbles was changing too often). 

Also, many sounds might be new to you, give it time!  Took me 6 months for 80% and 95% after 2 years.  I often have to ask ""am I hearing something?""  ""what is that sound?"" to hearing friends and learn stuff like the beep when cars go backwards (took me 3 weeks to learn...)

It can be a good idea to ask the audioprothesist about the configuration possibilities.  One I wish I knew earlier : frequency shifting.  Sounds in the lower frequencies/dB can be shifted at higher freqs/dB to perceive them better.  If there was stuff you learnt before, you gotta re-learn it though.",2024-10-15 13:56:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g48bfq/got_my_ha_today/

First of all, you should definitely go get an audiogram and figure out what level of hearing loss you have. That's quite important.

You can get an audiogram at [Costco](https://www.costco.ca/hearing-aid-faqs.html) if you're in the US or Canada.

Get a diagnosis now.

Welcome to the club. The human hearing organ is honestly garbage. It is prone to the lamest thing in our environment such as chewing on potato chips or nuts could damage it.

I damaged mine too.

Let your ear rest with headphone.
Play radio on the lowest possible volume that you can still hear to keep neuroplasticity in the brain.
Overtime your ear can rest and recover.

Once full recovery is achieve, access the lost with an Audiogram. Most likely ZERO hearing loss. Because anything above 25 decible is considered normal hearing.

Makes you wonder, who comes up with this crack. The ideal hearing should be 0 decible. I do not take any losses as normal.

This makes 99.9% of the human population with varying degree of hearing loss. 


As you can see, it is almost inevitable at this point. They are classifying as functional or non functionality hearing loss really..


If you have airpods, use transparent mode, turn up the volume, viola, you're fixed.

Just baby whatever hearing you have now, overtime your brain will settle as the new normal.",2024-10-14 02:51:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g36gyx/does_snhl_gets_worse_with_time/

I love ConnectClip! I used it during high school and it was very very helpful. Not perfect, but definitely helpful. It requires another conversation with that teacher and as a tip if you get them, i would go in before or after class before you start having them wear it so you can teach them how to turn it on or off and turn it up, so if they need to leave the room for anything or talk to someone privately or you switch from teaching you working quietly on anything in class, they can turn it off and back on again when it is time to start teaching again.

If it helps, there is an app called Otter that i like for transcribing. The free version has limited space for storing transcriptions, but that was never a problem for me since i used it to watch during class and not for long term notes. There are others out there as well, so it might be good to try out a few different ones and see what you like

I’m also in college rn and I’m currently using an EduMic connected to my hearing aids via Bluetooth my only gripe about it is that recently it’ll only pair to one hearing aid and no matter how many times i try and adjust the settings on my phone it won’t work so I’ll just disconnect it. However, majority of the time say 95% it works perfectly fine. 

I would get in contact with your accessibility office or someone who can speak on your behalf such as a access specialist who can arrange accommodations like an ALD or extended time on exams if needed",2024-10-12 05:43:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g1tho7/anyone_have_experience_with_ald/
1g12rnx,hardofhearing,budget friendly alternative hearing aid (Airpods etc),"So I had a Sony WH-CH720N headphone, I realized there is a ambient passthrough, much like a hearing aid. With a voice passthrough option.

While it is very noisy and too much background noise. I can actually hear better using my headphone as audio passthrough. Many environmental sound that wasn't presented to me are there. It was awesome.

It is way better than normal hearing.
I was wondering if real hearing aid is similar to this? I have never had hearing aids before in my life so I don't know.

Have anyone used any other devices as your hearing aid? I've checked the prices for hearing aid but it is incredibly expensive. Your apple airpods is way more cheaper. 
 Can it replace professional hearing aids?

Anyone done this?

No OTC “hearing aids” can replace professionally programmed HAs, but if it’s either OTC HAs or nothing, OTC HAs might be better. I would also look costco HAs as I have heard they are cheaper, and they are close to (if not actually) professionally programmed HAs

Anything over the counter (especially if it is not even technically meant for hearing loss) is not going to be as good. They are also not going usually programmable to your specific hearing loss, which means they won’t accurately cover the exact sound ranges that your hearing specifically struggles with. And most hearing devices bought in regular stores are just sound amplifiers, which are not the same thing and could potentially do more damage.

That being said, if you are finding that something is helpful for your hearing, there is no reason why you shouldn’t use it as long as it doesnt do any damage!

Also if you are curious about real hearing aids, many professional audiology places will let you have a trial pair of hearing aids to see if they seem helpful to you and if you like them. So if you want to try them out to see the difference, that could possibly be an option.

I would also like to point out that if you have never been diagnosed with hearing loss with professional testing and you just struggle with background noise, it could also possibly be an audio processing problem and not hearing itself (a very common misdiagnosis.) I would definitely ask a doctor about this just in case. It can be misdiagnosed even with hearing testing, because without testing for auditory processing specifically, they can sometimes look like the same thing.

(I have been hard of hearing all my life, but only recently found out that i have both hearing loss AND auditory processing difficulties. It definitely explains a lot.)",2024-10-11 05:37:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g12rnx/budget_friendly_alternative_hearing_aid_airpods/

I am 24 and am HoH (getting hearing aids this upcoming week)  I have no personal experience with cochlear implants. I do however have a friend who suddenly lost her hearing when she was 15ish. It turns out I have the same type of hearing loss as her, so she was giving some insight in case the same thing happens to me. Even with her CIs she has to rely on speech - reading to understand people. The type she has prohibit her from gettign any MRIs done. She gets severe migraines from them unfortunately and they said if they were to do it over again, they probably wouldn't choose to get them. 

I will say, it seems that quite a few people have great success with them.  I have joined some Facebook groups and there are a bunch of people who lost their hearing as adults who really love their CIs.",2024-10-10 21:46:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1g0u4zg/cochlear_implant_results/

1g0qtqh,hardofhearing,My Hearing Loss Story ,"This is gonna be a long one. Sit back, relax, and enjoy. 

My hearing loss is because of a chromosomal deletion syndrome. Here is my story about the surgeries I got, why you should not get surgeries as a kid, and more. 

On 12/05/02 she (aka me) underwent bilateral tube placement with tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, electro-turbinectomy of the inferior turbinates and electro-submucous resection.  She has had at least two surgeries on each ear.  On the right, she underwent a right tympanoplasty with reconstruction of the ossicular chain and stapes mobilization on 08/07/07.  On 01/24/08 she again underwent right tympanoplasty with reconstruction of the tympanic membrane, ossicular chain, atticotomy, malleus and stapes mobilization and PE tube placement.  On 10/09/07 she underwent a left tympanoplasty with reconstruction of the tympanic membrane, ossicular chain, and stapes mobilization.  She currently wears hearing aids in both ears but is interested in seeing if there are any other options other than hearing aids to help improve her hearing. 

**What my doctor said about my ears now:** 

Bilateral postauricular scars.  Bilateral cerumen buildup.  That was cleared.  Right ear has a very thickened drum which does not move with Valsalva.  I cannot see or identify the malleus.  The left tympanic membrane does move with Valsalva I can identify a remnant of the malleus and probably a piece of cartilage embedded in the tympanic membrane.

Scores on Audiology tests: Audiogram: I personally evaluated the audiogram which was done today and the results showed on the right ear a mixed hearing loss, with an SRT of 55 and 92% discrimination score. On the left ear a mixed hearing loss, with an SRT of 50 and 88% discrimination score.    
  
End results:  Given her history of multiple ear surgeries this could be the result of several different acicular fixation or discontinue it he.  Since he already had at least 1 trial of acicular chain reconstruction in each ear I do not think this is a simple case of a stapes fixation.  I had a long discussion with her, and her mother, about our options which are: Watchful waiting with continuous use of her hearing aids or surgery to improve her hearing.  Surgery could be either a trial of acicular chain reconstruction with prosthesis or a bone implant.  I went through the risks and benefits of acicular chain reconstructions and told both of them that given her history the risks for hearing loss due to surgery is higher but also that the chances of improving hearing are smaller.  We have gone through the risks and benefits of bone implants 

EAR: Bilateral postauricular scars.  Right side cerumen buildup.  That was cleared.  She seems to have a small right side mastoid cavity that was cleaned today.  Right ear has a very thickened drum which does not move with Valsalva.  I cannot see or identify the malleus.  The left tympanic membrane does move with Valsalva I can identify a remnant of the malleus and probably a piece of cartilage embedded in the tympanic membrane.

I was looking through my medical records from when I was a kid and  I found out I have mild hearing loss(30dcb in my left ear but I'm pretty sure it's now affecting both ears). If someone is talking at a normal volume I can't hear them at all out of my right ear and can barely hear them out of my left ear. I do plan on scheduling a appointment to get it checked eventually but it's going to take awhile. I've struggled my whole life with talking too loud and being told I need to lower my voice. It took me until now (almost 20) to finally realize I speak louder because I can't hear properly. I'm not even sure if I would be able to get hearing aids as my insurance sucks so does the medical system here. At this point I don't even know if I should be upset, mad, or what.

1fwxv3l,hardofhearing,Finally convinced my dad to take a hearing test—thanks to an online option,"My dad has been struggling with hearing issues for quite some time, but he always brushed it off and refused to get it checked professionally. He'd joke about it or blame the background noise, but it was starting to affect our conversations, and I was getting really concerned.

I tried getting him to take some online hearing tests, but they were either too complicated or the results weren't clear. He'd end up more confused and even more skeptical about the whole thing.

Then I came across [onlinehearingtest.org](https://www.onlinehearingtest.org/). They mentioned that they analyze the test using AI, which sounded promising. The first test was free, so I convinced him to give it a shot.

Surprisingly, he found the test straightforward, and we received an audiogram and a diagnosis afterward (I've attached a picture). We're not entirely sure how accurate it is, and I think they're still in beta since some things were a bit rough around the edges, but it finally gave us something tangible to work with. The best part is, he's now open to the idea of getting it professionally checked.

Has anyone else tried this site or have experience with that online test ? how accurate is it?

1fwb7ch,hardofhearing,Getting worse but it's not showing on the tests ,"So I've had issues with my ears my whole life. I was deaf until I was five, got surgery which made it significantly better (though I still had below average hearing), then lost almost all my hearing in my right ear again in elementary school. The causes for that are still unknown, even though I've been to a great number of specialists. 

Lately - which is, the past year - I feel like I've been getting worse again. Although the ""volume"" I hear things at didn't change too much, the ""quality"" did. I can barely understand what people are saying anymore. Everything is muffled and noises melt together and I can't discern them. My tinnitus (which I've also had my entire life, related to my hearing issues) has also been getting louder. 

So I went to a handful of doctors again, did a few hearing tests and they show...nothing. It kinda frustrates me. Even with my hearing aids, it doesn't get better. It helps me identify the direction a sound is coming from and also blocks out the tinnitus a bit, but I still have so much trouble understanding spoken language. Or telling sounds apart in general. I know there's something, but not what it is. This goes for normal face to face conversation, movies, phone calls, music, and so on. Idk what to do anymore. This sucks.

1fw220k,hardofhearing,Oticon Sentio System Users,"Hello fellow mono hearers! Long time reader, first time poster. I just had a quick question. Have you or anyone you know had the new Sentio System from Oticon Medical surgery yet? I’ve looked everywhere for information, but I was just looking for what to expect from surgery and if there are any current users out there. I know it just got FDA approval and they performed the first surgery in Alabama not long ago on someone. 

All the information I find is from their website.

Brief backstory: I was diagnosed with a cholesteatoma in February of 2023, has my first tympanomastiodectomy the following month. The disease was advanced, so I lost my ossicular chain; hence conductive hearing loss. I got my 2nd stage surgery in March of this year with a prosthesis put in. Alas, scar tissue grew around the implant and my hearing is somehow much worse with mixed hearing loss now. Doctor recommended getting a BAHA implant, and wanting to avoid the abutment, I opted for the Cochlear Osia 2. This past month, my implant specialist called and told me about the new Sentio System and how excited they were, they just got approved to do the surgeries, and a representative from the company would fly in to oversee the surgery if I choose it; because I would be the first for the hospital system (Froedtert Medical College of Wisconsin). She felt it would be the better option for me, so I chose it. I’ll be having surgery for it November 21st.


I was just curious what the recovery time would be, how the sound quality is from someone that has actually taken the leap. Any information would be greatly appreciated!

Shokz hands down. They are pricey but they last. I’m also a runner (along with being hard of hearing), they hold up to sweat and being dropped. I love them.

I use them often and don't have any problems but if I'm in a really loud environment I have to put an ear plug in to be able to hear whatever is playing. 

I work at a factory and can wear them and hear fine with no ear plugs most days, I do also have hearing loss on my right side. I do talk on the phone more then listen to stuff. 

Some shows I watch in the factory I'll need to use a headphone. I do have to turn my sound up more then halfway but since they don't go in my ears I'm not as worried about it. 

When I'm on the phone people say they can hear me very well with the bone conducive headphones. 

I use openmove aftershokz.

I borrowed my wife's Shokz, I couldn't hear the music well enough unless I cranked it. Even then it wasn't good and would be clearly audible to those around me.

Try not to worry, a week is not a long time to wait until you can ask someone qualified to give an answer.

I'd suspect you're talking up to a couple of weeks off work. Potentially quite a while where it's not advised that you do any really strenuous exercise (e.g. weight lifting) due to the risk of hurting your ear while it's still healing. I think this is very much precautionary and surgeons are likely to vary on their advice.

But write those questions down and ask them properly next week!

Following this! My dr just told me tympanoplasty was the way to go and scheduled for December. He told me the healing process wont be bad though and itll be like the symptoms I already have (ear drainage, hars to hear, etc). Hope it goes well for you!

Hi there! I can help. Yes, every surgeon is different. If it’s just a tympanoplasty, you’ll be able to work soon after surgery if you just have a desk job. Most patients take a week off of work but I have plenty of patients that’s say they started working the next day cause they felt fine.

Depends on the cause of your hearing loss, if it’s genetic or not there are many causes that aren’t genetic. And if yours is, then it would also depend on the genetics of the person you have a child with.

Most deaf children are born to hearing parents (like you). But above answer is correct.

It really depends on the cause. I was born hearing an lost it around 15-17 years old my hearing loss is caused by a genetic condition causing nerve damage I was told it’s very unlikely for me to have a deaf child but that there is still  always a possibility.

i was born with hearing loss without any family history, and after testing found out that it’s from a genetic mutation. because of this i have a 50/50 chance of passing it on. if yours is genetic, then you can work out the chances. if it isn’t genetic, then it is random",2024-10-03 20:27:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fvhdxp/deaf_in_one_ear_chances_of_my_kid_being_the_same/

Have the hospital/consultants commented on these side effects? Have you managed to talk to them about it?

Call the surgeon's office and let them know what's going on and what your concerns are.  They'll give you way better advice for your specific situation than you can get here.

When I had ear surgery I got a sick note for 2 weeks off work - did you ask your surgeon how long before you go back to usual activities?

I think taste disturbance is a common side effect of ear surgery - usually it's not permanent but like others are saying, it's still worth asking your surgeon about. &amp; similarly with hearing loss - this is most likely temporary while your ear heals.

But yeah see if you've already got anything on what to expect side effect/recovery wise from your surgeon, and if not or if you're still concerned, give them a call. Also take some time off work/uni while you recover - you probably won't need two weeks but definitely give yourself more than a couple of days!

When I had each of my 4 ossicle surgeries, the doctors specifically called out altered taste as a potential temporary or (rare) permanent side effect. I also had packing in my ear and couldn’t hear anything until it was taken out. Are you sure your ear isn’t full of cotton?",2024-10-03 11:27:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fv5f9e/had_surgery_dont_feel_well/

a smart watch that vibrates could work

An Apple Watch is probably his best option. He doesn't need the latest model so a used/refurbished one would be fine.

He can set the watch to vibrate when the phone rings. He can also use ""focus modes"" so that it only vibrates for limited reasons, like he can specify his work phone number.

Another option would be to use Hue light bulbs and IFTTT. He could set up a routine on IFTTT to flash the light bulb when the phone rings. I have one set up to flash my lights when the doorbell rings.

Does he wear hearing aids? Mine connect to my phone using Bluetooth so I sleep with my hearing aids on. The ringer goes straight to my ears. Have yet to have them not work. 

Couple that with an Apple Watch and that’s probably the best you can do.

There’s vibrating alarm clocks that connects to the phone like a phone station on the alarm clock…another option on that one

Apple Watches will vibrate. Very easy to notice and it also will show you the number of the caller on the watch screen. I don’t recommend trying to take calls on the watch itself, it’s very quiet- just take it from the phone.

Hey, I'm on call all the time too.

  
I put my phone directly under my pillow when I'm sleeping so I can feel the vibration when someone calls. Also I wear an apply watch to bed which also vibrates my wrist.

iPhones do not work with hearing aids that are not Apple compatible as far as Bluetooth is concerned. That’s in regards to alarm. Apple is aware of this and will release an update someday.

Also bass triggers my tinnitus a bit, and maybe i have some low frequency hearing loss but on 200hz, because i can hear bass on music without problems (20-160hz) but i have some trouble on voices. also i hear multiple tinnitus, the 1480hz one, other that's more deep (200-400hz) and other on 6000hz, which is only on my right ear.

They play little tricks like sneak up behind me and make noise, to ""prove"" I'm faking it. I never had this problem at previous jobs. And it's getting really difficult to cope.

What you're describing sounds like harassment. If they can't respect that you have a disability, and act accordingly, perhaps it's time to get leadership involved. Talk with your supervisor. If the supervisor is in on it, go up the chain of command.

I’d suggest talking to them again and telling them that you feel very uncomfortable when they do that. 
If it keeps going on after that you might talk with HR about it. I wouldn’t make the HR talk about issues with specific people but that you feel uncomfortable in that working environment rn and maybe a sensitivity training could help. 
Those steps should be reasonable. 
If they now do it more or start having a grunt, document everything.
Make a list with time and date. 
Could be useful for anything legal after that. 
I really hope it doesn’t come that far.

Please take this to a manager or HR, it’s not something you should have to sort out yourself. This is really cruel of them and I’m so sorry you’re having to experience this behaviour

Your coworkers sound really stupid. Either they think hearing is an all-or-nothing thing, or they know but they just think it's great to make fun of someone's disability. Either way, they're stupid. 

But yeah, if you're okay with talking to HR or your supervisor, ask them to talk to your coworkers, and hopefully to say that they (the supervisor/HR) have noticed that other employees are behaving this way, and it needs to stop.

Do you have hearing aids? People seem to lack a lot of empathy...

Most people are dumb unfortunately. Same with blindness, not everyone have 100% blindness. It is either hearing or vision reduced.

It's a spectrum

*connection workers should say co-workers.

I'm kind of an A hole when people give me a hard time about my hearing. It's not like I chose to have crappy hearing. Myself though, I'd probably just find a new job to not have to work with d bags like that haha. I don't feel like HR ever does much good in situations like that. In my experiences, most people are pretty understanding when I have to ask someone to repeat themselves.

The sound like my family. I'm NC with them now. My brother was constantly tiring to prove I'm ""faking"".  Document everything and go to HR or leadership. Remember, HR is there to protect the company so make sure you have documentation at home as well as at work. Document when they did it, the date and time, who did it and who was there to witness it. I'm so sorry this is happening.

I wouldn’t waste my time trying to explain it to them but I’m the same way, a lot of people say it seems like I am not HOH. But it’s because I’m super alert and am LOOKING at the person talking to me reading their lips. I’m putting in a ton of effort to be able to hear them, I don’t think most people realize that part. I can hear noises but I can’t tell what they are or where they’re coming from sometimes. There are different types of hearing loss. I have sensorineural but I also have auditory processing issues which means that even if do hear the words, the connections between my ears and my brain don’t transfer and I don’t know what they said. The closest way I can explain so people kinda get it is it’s like all the words the person said is floating in my mind out of order, with a couple words missing.

This is a workplace violation in most countries, you're being bullied because of your disability. You need to get HR involved and get it sorted, or find another job where you aren't surrounded by assholes.

I know this sounds pretty extreme, if you have hearing aids, take them off and show them. That's what I have to do before, I only did it once and decided it's not my problem if they believe me or not. This is definitely Italy illegal under ADA,research work laws when it comes to ADA so you can take action.",2024-10-01 08:37:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ftjasd/dealing_with_coworkers/
1ftdizq,hardofhearing,Sound is low volume still,"I may have slight low frequency loss and auditory processing disorder. How common is low frequency loss? Like there is no OMPH to sound and overall my hearing feels flat. Also the volume is certain spacious feels muffled.

But I already did two audio test and both of them show normal hearing? Why?

Also the result were inconsistent. Because it is taken in different clinic where my Audio Processing Disorder is changing. Can the tonal test be trusted? Look at the 2k Hertz, it went from the worse to being the best???

Yes due to my audio procressing disorder which I probably had, is changing my perception of different frequencies. It either decrease or increase a particular frequency. And also changes my volume.


I did an youtube hearing test which they play frequency from 125Hz to 20Khx. I can hear from 125Hz to 16.5KHz which minimal volume. I test it with my brother with 125KHz for my low frequency issue and used the lowest volume on my iPhone. I can still hear it and my brother too. 

I still feel like I had hearing loss because honestly the sound just wasn't the same as before. But none of the test captures it at all.

For example low frequencies will sound muddy and ring my head. High frequency would be hyperaucis. 

I am not sure if my hearing loss is Cohclear or Brain (APD) related. My cohclear seem to be able to detect wide range of frequencies but my nervous or brain system seem to be affected. I also had tinnitus which is going away and my sensoriual hearing is improving sightly daily?

How confident can I say if my APD went away, I would make a full recovery since my Cohclear seem capable?

That hearing test is perfectly normal, no loss indicated on either. Some minor variation +/- 5 dB is acceptable between tests

This is what my audiogram used to look like before the meiniers really set in and I got a diagnosis.  You may need more time for it to progress before they can figure out what's wrong. I was told my hearing was normal and all the same things you were, and now I've got hearing aids, mild-moderate loss, and vertigo from hell

I have no idea how common it is or not, but I'm 24 and I have progressive sensorineural hearing loss. I'm getting hearing aids in about 2 weeks (whenever they arrive). I have moderate low frequency hearing loss that rises to mild in the high frequencies. It took them 7 years to know it was progressive. The first hearing test I had was normal even though I was having ringing in my ears. It's gotten slowly worse each year and is now taking slightly bigger drops

1ftck20,hardofhearing,Problems at the laundrymat,"It's exasperating. I had some stranger ready to pop off because I ""kept staring at her"". 

I'm Hard of Hearing. Today's a bad hearing day. I'm not staring, I'm constantly scanning to figure out if someone needs something from me or is talking to me so I don't appear like I'm ignoring them or in the way of what they next need. It's like a no-win situation. I hate having to explain that I'm not staring at you, I'm just going deaf. I'm rude if I don't answer you, and I'm rude if I'm being attentive. My hearing aids aren't even skin colored. They're silver. It's not like you can't see them falling off or sticking out from behind my ears.

i have just given up on scanning rooms at this point. if someone needs me they can come to me. sometimes i even wear bulky headphones since that is a socially acceptable reason to not respond to people

I have my other favorite as someone who reads lips: “why do you keep staring at the bottom half of my face?”

Susan I’m deaf and that’s where your lips are, so you want me to understand you our not.

I thought I was the only one who did this.

Fuck. I just realized I scan rooms all the time trying to anticipate people trying to interact with me.

The great thing about being an introvert who avoids interactions with strangers is that I don't scan rooms. Just ignore others and if they need my attention, they can tap my shoulder.

Basically, who cares if others think that you are rude, when in fact, they are just ignorant of your hearing loss. Stop worrying about what others think and just do you.

It’s all part of the hearing loss journey. As someone who’s deaf, it’s like a 6th sense, always scanning my surroundings since I can’t hear. Totally normal! If someone needs something, they’ll let you know. I usually point to my ear when someone speaks, and that helps them realize I’m deaf, so I use my phone for live transcribe, etc. I made peace with it a long time ago, and honestly, it’s been the best thing ever.",2024-10-01 01:38:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ftck20/problems_at_the_laundrymat/
1ft5nus,hardofhearing,Telling classmates you're hoh?,"I just started my masters degree in Zurich just 2 weeks ago. I did my bachelor's online in the US. I got hearing aids in March 2024, so wearing hearing aids and interacting with people who's first language isn't the same as mine is getting difficult. I find I'm twisting and turning in my chair in class to be able to see their face so I can read their lips. I've had some hearing loss since I was a toddler and somehow developed the ability to lip read, hearing loss got worse with COVID infection and now need hearing aids. 

My question is would you tell the whole class that you read lips and need to be able to see their face? 

I told one teacher because I know some people get weirded out during one and one conversation when they notice I look at their lips while speaking instead of their eyes. I'm sure it's noticeable that I'm basically doing chair yoga to see everyone's lips while they talk.

I always tell people that i am. I just give a heads up, so they know i am not ignoring them or acting out of bad faith, because i know some behavior can be interpreted that way. This way they wont build any negative ideas because of that (they may not like me, but that is alright).

Also, i tell them that when i al they repeat themselves they use the exact same sentence, because i probably heard half of it and just want to fill the gaps. No need to become a screamer, just articulate better. (I need to repeat this a lot, mind you, but i always act like they are acting like an idiot when they become way too loud).

That’s quite the adjustment, going from online to in-class with a slight language barrier as well. Sorry to hear it’s been so difficult!

If I were you, I’d just tell people up front, something along the lines of: “Is it okay if I sit here? I’m hard of hearing and can follow along better if I can read lips.” 

I have a coworker who has an eye condition. During presentations she often reminds us that she needs to sit straight in front of the presentation, otherwise she can’t see it properly. 

Hope this helps!

How is your hearing? Also do people when you told this react bad? I hope it's gonna be fine.

Hi Mariadove,

 I’m leading the development of a pair of headphones designed specifically for the Hard of Hearing community. This project is a collaboration with Logitech, and we’re focused on creating something that truly addresses the needs and challenges faced by HOH individuals.

To make sure we’re heading in the right direction, I would love to hear directly from you! I’m seeking volunteers for short interviews to share your experiences and insights on what could make headphones more effective or comfortable for daily use.

Whether it’s difficulties you’ve faced with traditional headphones, specific features you wish they had, or even general thoughts on assistive technology, your input would be invaluable to our design process.

If you’re interested, feel free to comment below or DM me, and we can set up a time that works best for you.

Thank you in advance for your time and insights!

I did for my grad program.  It prevents (some) anger when I ask the instructor to repeat. Not sure how things work in your country, but I use my ADA accommodations (zoom has to be captioned, and they can wear my Phonak Roger). 

I say this. Hey yall, I'm Bulky. I am hard of hearing and I wear hearing aids. I have a Roger (hold up my Roger) so I can hear you better. I'm going to need captioning on zoom meetings and I might ask you to repeat yourself. 

I also let them know that I'm autistic. It's works for most classes however, I've I'm not in a zoom class and the teacher doesn't caption, I have a hell of a time understanding. 

Most folks are kind about it. I made one friend that knows ASL. I met a Blind student and we kind of stick together.

It's definitely a good idea to advocate for yourself! Letting people know what works best for you, like needing to see their lips to read or making sure the lighting’s good, can make things a lot easier. Most people don’t mind making small adjustments once they know what you need. It’s always better to speak up—whether it’s your teachers or classmates—so they can help you out. It’ll definitely make things smoother for you!",2024-09-30 20:26:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ft5nus/telling_classmates_youre_hoh/
1fszxk2,hardofhearing,Alarm clock,"Does anyone have any recommendations for an alarm clock that shakes the bed? My mom is getting more and more hard of hearing and she cannot hear her alarm if she's not wearing her hearing aids.

There are so many to choose from and I don't trust the reviews online as much as I trust real humans. 

I appreciate suggestions for what to buy, or more importantly, what not to buy.

I have a bed shaker however I don't use it at all anymore. 

What works best for me is a smart watch that has an alarm clock function. I believe I paid 40 dollars for it on Amazon which is less then most bed shaker alarm clocks. It's a fitness/sleep tracker type thing. I set the alarm on the watch, go to sleep and my watch vibrates on my wrist to wake me up. So far it's been totally fool proof. 

Veryfit is the app that goes with the watch. Me and my wife both have the same watch and we're happy with it.

Sonic Boom is your answer. I’ve had one for years and am dead to the world when my ears are off at night.
I slip it under my fitted sheet so it doesn’t get moved or pushed off the bed accidentally.

It might help to shop where you can get free returns.

Just don't do what I did. Bought two shakers, one for the alarm and one for my doorbell. Someone came to see me on a day I worked hard and was tired and went to sleep deeply, but when they rang the shaker doorbell I got up quickly and got dressed and went to work 12 hours too early. 6PM and 6AM in the winter both look dark outside.

Granted, my hearing loss is not super severe, but what has worked the best for me is a tunable white light bulb that starts off at a very dim yellow, and over 60 minutes transitions to a bright white. It taps into the body's natural circadian rhythm, and I've found it to be more effective than any auditory/vibrating alarm in terms of both waking up on time and actually feeling awake in the morning. 

I have smart bulbs that I've just put on schedules, but you can also find alarm clocks that do this, and that might be best for your mom depending on her tech literacy.

I really like those vibrating alarms that you put under your pillow!!

I reccomend a cheap fitbit that can work as an alarm, I started with that since higher pitched alarma would wake everyone else but me. Upgraded to a fitbit back when they first came out just for the alarm and have never looked back. There's nothing like a strong vibration on your wrist to wake you right up!

1fsw7su,hardofhearing,Ear infection or hearing loss?,"Hey all,
So basically 2 days ago after my shower my left ear started ringing, and wouldn’t stop doing so for like an hour and a half. I finally got it to stop via a hot compress. Anyways, fast forward a day later and I’m in the car, with the music on thinking wow this isn’t very loud. I could hear it perfectly clearly, but it wasn’t loud enough for my liking. Anyways, my friends got in the car and told me good god this is pretty loud. I could hear it perfectly fine, and I could hear everything on the lowest volume which they struggled to hear, but I like my music to be “felt” in my ears (probs why I’m posting here lol), and that volume wasn’t doing it. 

Anyways, fast forward today and I am completely paranoid, hyper fixated on sounds (I also have bad anxiety as a side condition ) and have booked in with an audiologist to make sure everything’s fine. 

My ears feel slightly muffled insofar as everything is clear, but bass and other sounds are quite flat if that makes sense? I also have kinda a pressure feeling in my ears. I’m wondering if this all links back to the ringing, and is just an ear infection? I’ve never had any trouble with hearing before and I’m really starting to freak out. I also am quite careful with how loud I listen to headphones. If it helps as info I also have been feeling like I’m about to get sick for the past week, but haven’t gotten sick yet. To add on as well there is extremely high pollen where I live moment as we’ve just hit spring..
Thoughts? 
Thanks!

I think the best thing you can do right now is make a doctor’s appointment. Talk to them about your symptoms and your concerns. Ask them to do a preliminary hearing test, and send in a referral for a full hearing test with an audiologist. It sounds like you’re feeling really overwhelmed and kinda stuck. Try not to spiral or go down the rabbit hole. And see if you can get some antihistamines like Zyrtec (pill) and Flonase (nasal spray). Using them together is safe, and should help reduce any inflammation you’re having due to allergies.

Any updates

1fskmh6,hardofhearing,Someone Claiming to be HOH,"My cousin (HOH that's getting progressively worse) has an ex-friend that recently put HOH in her bio. My cousin asked her about it and the girl explained that she had cholesteatoma (Cholesteatoma is an abnormal growth in your middle ear behind your eardrum. It can be congenital (present from birth), but typically happens because you have chronic ear infections) and that she went to an ""ear doctor"" and the doctor said that it could be serious if she didn't get it removed and that she was Hard of Hearing. 
I think she must have misheard the doctor saying she could be HOH in the FUTURE. I do not deny that she has hearing loss but being HOH and having hearing loss is different.

How does she tell the girl that she isn't HOH? Cholesteatoma is treatable and then once treated will disappear (except a few cases where it has progressed way too far which hers has not) and being HOH is a permanent issue and cannot be fixed only worsen (which my cousin's hearing is getting worse). You can only use devices to help but they don't fix your hearing. 
As a HOH person who has hearingaids I find this offensive that someone claims to be HOH when they are not and could have easily educated themselves especially because they talked to a doctor and they could have listened to what the doctor said!

How does someone with hearing loss not be considered someone who is Hard of Hearing?

It sounds like this ex-friend could have conductive hearing loss. Many conductive hearing losses can be treated, because they are caused by an obstruction rather than irreversible nerve damage.

There's no way to know for sure without an audiogram, but an abnormal growth in the ear can certainly cause conductive hearing loss.

It could be because of the dynamics of being an ""ex""-friend in why you find it offensive, but this person identifying as hard of hearing is not offensive to me. I think anyone with any degree of hearing loss should be able to use that identifier and not be gate-kept away for not being ""hard of hearing enough"" or ""deaf enough.""

There is no olympics for hearing loss. Any degree of hearing loss can impact daily functions and those with any degree of hearing loss should feel free to to use whichever label is beneficial to them.

having hearing loss and being heard of hearing are not different, they are just different labels for the same thing. if anything you are the one being offensive by acting arrogant and like you know everything about being HoH

It sounds like this person is going through a lot with their hearing loss.

I'm sure it's hard for them, confusing, and they are trying to understand it.

The only appropriate response is solidarity and support.

When it comes to hearing loss, most of us who are HOH have a range.

This person has a blockage in the ear.  Yes, it can be operated on.  They are still hard of hearing. 

They went to an ""ear doctor"" for a reason.

Support this person, in solidarity, and with compassion.

Why are you concerned with gatekeeping terms on someone else's hearing problems?

I have had cholesteatoma surgery and now wear a hearing aid. Plus they can come back.

1fqzr9c,hardofhearing,Identifying questions,"I have moderate hearing loss and it is progressing. My question is what is appropriate to identify as?

I am trying to learn ASL as fast as I can to prepare for when I don't have as much hearing as I do now, as well as learning general deaf culture. Any help is appreciated.

The point at which I switched from identifying as hard of hearing to identifying as deaf is when I realized that I need a laundry list of things in order to understand a single thing anyone is saying. 

Like, if you can generally understand people and actually are able to follow conversations to an okay degree, that’s HoH, but just standing there while people make noises you can’t ID as words is deaf. 

It’s not a real qualification, just my personal one, because it’s based on how you come across to hearing people. “deaf” says “i am generally not going to understand you vocally” while hard of hearing is “i’ll probably understand you okay but maybe not in a loud restaurant or if you’re whispering etc”.

“deaf” is also more of a “I need to use/learn [local sign language] in order to effectively communicate”

I’m HoH by definition, but I call myself Deaf because my Deaf teacher in ASL 2 class I took, told me I was apart of the Deaf community. No one’s ever told me I was apart of any community, so I say it with pride. 

Deaf is also easier to explain in loud noises situations. Especially when I don’t have my hearing aides in. Hard of hearing doesn’t seem to garner the same kind of help as “hey, I’m deaf in my left ear…” when I tell ppl I’m HoH in my left they want up yell over there. It’s stupid.

Following bc I have the same question

Deaf is Deaf culture, and deaf is about your ability to hear.

as a hoh person i do not consider myself Deaf or deaf. i'm sure some do.

I can only understand people in a quiet room and usually only after they repeat several times. with my hearing aids, I can usually understand people in a quiet room. I struggle in noisy environments. I say HoH, but within my family I’m the ‘deaf’ one, because if I don’t have my ‘ears’ in, I miss pretty much everything.  🤷🏼‍♀️ however, I’m terrified of giving myself a label because I feel like I won’t be accepted either way so I typically just say I wear hearing aids and leave it at that. I am teaching myself and my daughter ASL.

It's a spectrum. Utilize hard of hearing until you feel comfortable utilizing deaf. I am bimodal, and qualify for a CI in my better ear where I use a HA. Therefore, I now identify as deaf, whereas I always identified as HoH before. But that is my personal story.

I just say I wear hearing aids, and have trouble, hearing, mis hearing, and understanding when people talk to me.

I try not to go to into detail with people i meet, because in my experience people don't really understand that you can hear a sound, but it isn't loud enough to understand, tell what it is, etc. They kinda just want it to be black and white.

Obviously I do not know your financial situation, but ask your audiologist about bluetooth. Lots of hearing aids now come with bluetooth, though is is more expensive. It will he hard to hear music with regular earbuds/headphones.

I am hard of hearing and can listen to loud music without my hearing aids (like you it just sounds muffled) or I can listen through my Bluetooth hearing aids for my clarity or I can listen to music more quietly with over the ear headphones over my hearing aids. Experiment and find what works for you. I recently discovered nwm headphones and am saving to get some. They are over ear open ear headphones from Japan.

What worked best for me was a portable headphone amplifier with a cheap pair of in ear monitors. I could rubber band the headphone amp to my phone or my mp3 player and it would still fit in my pocket.  I do have a pair of over ear headphones that I could use over my hearing aids, but I got the best performance from taking my aids out and using in ear monitors.

Subtitles. Please for the love of God make sure the subtitles exist and actually line up with the dialogs.

Subtitles and real live caption like rainbow six siege did !

The hearing loss in my right ear is far more severe than my left which presents challenges in locating the direction a noise is coming from. I primarily play fps so hearing footsteps and other directional sound cues is paramount for excelling. I still haven’t found a headset or settings that fully accommodate it. I did but turtle beach pros which I think has helped some. 

Trying to get the mix of game audio and music audio right has been a challenge too

Couple things:

1. Good subtitles. Subtitles are more than just a box to be checked - simply having them often isn't really enough. They need to be a large enough font to be read (often on a variety of different screens and resolutions). They need to be legible, in a readable font, with enough contrast against the background to stand out. They need to appear on screen for the right amount of time.
2. Alternatives to audio queues. A lot of games design mechanics that only work if you can hear (indicating nearby enemies via footsteps/shooting, a timing puzzle that ""dings"" when you're supposed to press a button, etc), which can make things tough if you can't hear. There needs to be an option to add a visual cue as well for these - see Apex Legends for a game that does a decent job of this.
3. Granular volume sliders. There's nothing worse than a game that just has one big volume slide for everything - let me set the volume for dialogue, background music, audio cues, ambient sound, etc all separately.

Having a part of the game only relies on sound. For example, in Animal Crossing New Horizons, you catch a mole cricket by hearing it and then you have to dig holes to find it. I could never hear the cricket at all so I had to give my switch to my friend to play for a while so she could catch the cricket for me. I wasn’t able to do it myself and that sucked.

Captions! Also, the most immediate game  that comes to mind with challenges is Five Nights at Freddy's 4. Winning that game requires being able to hear the audio cues. Those definitely need alternatives.

For FPS games or games that rely on sound to locate actions, a visual sound direction indicator.  And the option to use mono audio.

No subtitles, or they are too small of a font for me to read. Or the subtitles are too long to realistically be able to read it all while still playing the game without someone coming along in the game while I'm distracted and killing me. So frustrating but that;s the way it is.

Lacking subtitles makes things difficult, and a challenge I have with for example shooters is that I can’t hear footsteps when they’re closeby, so you’re already at a disadvantage. Would love to see more visual sounds in games.

Along with others... subtitles that are adjustable. And for the love of everything, the ability to mute dogs or other sharp sudden noises. 


If something is ""hidden"" off screen a small flash to signal either there's a need to look around or direction where the noise is coming from....I think it's Fable with the gargoyle hunt, so maddening.

Subtitles help a ton. If queues are heard through sounds, an indicator helps.

Sometimes even if a game has subtitles for key scenes or instructions, they'll neglect to provide it for what they consider background or not important content. I get why- they don't want the screen cluttered up with text. My friends point out things npcs are saying or sounds from offscreen, and I had no idea it was part of the game. 

Its obviously more of a priority to get the main content, but going the extra mile to do the little stuff so I can get the full experience is really appreciated.

During a driving missions maybe put subtitles in center of screen. It's so hard to drive and read.

Correct subtitles and make sure the subtitles indicate which character is speaking or have different colored subtitles for each character. Alternatives to audio cues in the game such as a controller rumble or a visual cue",2024-09-26 12:29:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fpuz4z/hey_there_guys_im_trying_to_understand_what/
1fpevn1,hardofhearing,New hearing test result: some questions...,"Hi there. I'm from the UK and hoping someone can help to interpret the above audiogram, which I received on Monday - along with a set of new hearing aids I'm now wearing full time. All a bit sudden.

For background: I'm 56, first had a hearing test six years ago. Back then I was told I had mild hearing loss in the 25-30 decibel range &amp; was given my first set of aids. Didn't wear them much, tbh, as my hearing seemed OK. Three or four years ago, another hearing test and the result was almost exactly the same. The earlier  audiogram is here for comparison.

This time though, the audiologist said my hearing loss is 50db. He strongly advised wearing aids and fitted a pair there and then. They make a huge difference: the first thing was hearing people talking outside the corridor from his.office! I didn't even realise. And clocks ticking, birds singing, kettles boiling really loud! Still trying to process everything...

This is the NHS, however, and while I'm really appreciative of what I've been given there wasn't much time to ask questions. 

Going back to the audiogram, he  told me my hearing loss is ""moderate"". I've looked it up and that can be anything between 40db &amp; 70db of loss. I also understand it's a sensorineural loss.

But how did the audiologist arrive at 50db hearing loss he referred to? Is it an average based on the combined scores for each of the frequencies divided by? If so, the ""average"" is more than 50db. Could he have been trying not to worry me?

Also, is this worsening in the space of about 45 months normal? What can I expect going forward? Is there a ""linear"" progression?

Sorry for going on. These Signia NHS hearing aids are incredible. Still getting used to them. Things sound incredibly loud and a bit tinny right now, including my own voice. There's a bit of a hiss, although I don't notice it so much even after just two days.

But, man, Bluetooth? The phone relaying a call directly to my ears? Music from my mobile playlist feeding through while taking the dogs for a walk? Listening to a podcast without headphones? I feel like I've been given magic superpowers...

I hope you can help with my questions. Many thanks.

I think he might have meant the 50 db to be human speech range which is the middle region of the audiogram and usually what most people are the most impacted by. Probably just an off the top of his head average to give you an idea, I have a different type of hearing loss so I'm not sure if that's a common way for them to explain it to people.

Across the top are frequencies. You can find charts online that show common sounds at those frequencies and their decibels (ie a leaf blower, ac unit, etc.). Human speech is the whole middle area. On the y axis is the decibels. It's a measurement of how loud a tone had to be at a given frequency for you to hear it. So in this case your hearing gets worse and worse as it gets higher pitched, which is pretty common. Some people also have the reverse, where their low tones are bad and it gets better at higher frequencies, or my type of hearing loss, a cookie bite, where the middle of the audiogram has a ditch in it (that looks like a bit was taken out of it) which is very rare. 

Hearing aids are indeed incredible! You may also notice that you can understand people without looking st their face much easier, I discovered I had been lip reading to fill in blanks when I got my hearing aids and could suddenly take notes without looking at my professors.

ETA: there's also no way to really know how bad it is going to get or how fast. I'm dealing with that right now. You just have to get regularly retested and adjust accordingly, and you can also have some tests done to make sure something else isn't causing the hearing loss. I had an MRI to rule out Lupus specifically because of other testing I had done. But a lot of the time it's just genetics, or age.

Hearing aids truly are helpful. I found that once I began to wear them, I learned better how to listed to the sounds that blended in my ears. I've been fortunate to have hearing aids since I was 8 or so. 

Also, as a student, I love the Bluetooth feature lol. Great for listening to educational videos and music while I study.

We have almost the same amount of hearing loss! Except im 25 and was born hard of hearing.

The 50dB is practically the amount of hearing loss you have in speech recognition, its in a different audiogram than this one. 

You can expect it to worsen as you age but there is no telling in how much and how fast.

There is a lot of head pain and I definitely feel where they made an incision behind my ear. There is some sort of bandage when I touch behind my ear. It hurts quite a bit. 

I was told to make sure I don’t get water in the ear so I cleaned the site with water and changed the cotton dipped in Vaseline. I also feel restless and like I’m in another world and not wanting to do anything when I’m usually active. 

Doctor said I should see some of my hearing come back in a couple weeks, but it can take longer than that for my hearing to return. 

How long did it take to get your hearing back? Do you have any other tips or things that worked for you to get through recovery?

Sleep is your friend. I had some heavy meds 20 years ago when I got mine and I slept for like 10 days straight. Wake up, go to the bathroom, eat a few bites, take my meds, and back to sleep.

The surgery is pretty violent, your neck, shoulders will ache like hell. Thats normal.

Your ear canal is probably stuffed with gauze that dissolves over time. You’ll be able to hear once that’s gone.

Stay in front of the pain, and remember, you’ll be ok.

I got it removed plus facial nerve and a part of my hearing nerve. And a part of my skull behind my ear.  I was on heavy before the surgery and same thing after. Neuropathy medication was started and it got better. I put an ice pack day/night.  You need time to heal and it depends on how you can handle pain. We are all different.

[댓글]
How long have you had hearing loss? Hearing aids are not like glasses, once you lose certain frequencies, nothing can bring that back (aside from CIs or other surgeries for certain conditions). Hearing aids simply turn the sounds you can hear up louder and can help filter out background noise to make things a bit more clear. 

Hearing loss can have a significant impact on the brain. If you’ve had untreated hearing loss for a while, it can impair the brain’s ability to process and understand sounds, which makes it difficult to follow conversations and comprehend speech in general.

Auditory processing disorder is when the person has issues processing speech/sound without related peripheral hearing loss (ie, needing hearing aids) so technically you can’t have APD because you have hearing loss. That being said, many hard of hearing people struggle with speech processing despite adequate gain from hearing aids. That’s just the nature of hearing loss and the imperfections of aids, unfortunately",2024-09-24 19:42:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1folf4z/how_can_i_be_sure_that_i_dont_have_auditory/

[댓글]
How itchy it is when you wear them! And how noisy all the appliances are in the house

How sometimes you feel like the world is too noisy and you sometimes enjoy the silence being hard of hearing provides but get annoyed when you can’t hear things without them. The itchiness and moisture that can buildup in the ear from the ear molds. Pimples in the inner ear preventing you from wearing them. A newfound paranoia of getting wet when you wear them (rain, snow, sprinklers, water guns/balloons, etc.). It’s okay to not hide them. Wear fun colors, decorate them with hearing aid safe stickers and hearing aid charms. They are just as much a tool as glasses. Bluetooth hearing aids to listen to music are so so (putting your phone in your pocket is enough distance to interrupt the signal). Finding over the ear headphones that fit over hearing aids can be a struggle. The cost. Oh my the cost.

All the background noise...and the wind... maddening

I was lucky that my mum had hearing aids a couple of years before me and told me some useful things. Like how funny it is to eat crunchy things, that I would hear my hair rustling, that it would take time to get used to them and to stick with it, that I would get used to all the things that seem too loud/too much. 

But I have sensory processing problems that she doesn't so no one told me how tiring it is, how much they enhance background noise (and even the specific program doesn't help me) and how much longer it would take me to get used to them. I was told by the audiologist I have to have them on all day every day from day one but for me it was better to build up using them.

Resting your head on something just isn't the same. Either it pushes the HAs around, causing feedback, blocks sounds entirely, or lay one of two ways: on your back or facedown.

They crackle. They squeal. Mine squeal in a way I can’t hear them but other people can. They’re itchy. Your ears hurt after wearing them all day. You get tired from trying to separate the words from the noise. Sometimes you feel socially obligated to wear them when you would rather not. 

For me sometimes I feel like I’m wearing them more for everyone else than for myself. I wish my wife would learn some signs.

How loud people fart is…..

I knew I had loud dog toys. But I had no clue. The squeaking the crinkling. The noises! Have to take batteries out of stuff!

I definitely never wear them while driving because the car is too loud.

My ears are killing me after I have them in for about 5-6 hours they get so sore I have to take breaks from wearing them

How loud the world really is. And hearing aids lets you hear ALL sounds around you.  Even the ones you don’t want to hear.

How fun it is to be able to listen to music or podcasts without anyone knowing 😊

But I wish I had someone tell me about how to keep them clean, dry out your ears and the increased risk of ear infections.

Resting your head on something just isn't the same. Either it pushes the HAs around, causing feedback, blocks sounds entirely, or lay one of two ways: on your back or facedown.

The headaches everytime there is a change in volume or a hearing test. Also, you can HEAR the wind, that was new to me.

I have a cochlear implant and I still have to get used to it. I can’t play in the rain or listen to music in the shower anymore so sad lol

How noisy the world is. How annoying people talking can be. How distracting that co-workers clacks keyboard is.

Omg thank you for this thread! It's so nice to be able to relate to people!

Crushing ice in a refrigerator

My hair sweeping across the mic, my centrifuge at work making it hard to hear anything else, when one side won’t stream sound from media, but by god it’ll blast everything else at 150,000,000,000 decibels. How weird it can be if one is t seated quite right, making you take them out and put them back in a few times to be sure you got the sound right. Ugh, cleaning them. That it is possible to get custom molds so they don’t stab you in the brain if your ear canal is too small for medium domes and a bit to big for small domes.

That you have to put them in a drying case or else they get a little gross. Cleanig them can be gross. I've had mine since I was very young and I'm used to the cleaning process, but it baffled me when I found out that people think it's gross. 

Also everyone says having them is good, and it is, however people don't warn you for the bad things like how loud it is. I did not wear mine when I was younger despite having them because it is so hard getting used to the world.

Oh yeah, I just remembered, the surprise at the thundrous sound of going pee the first time after I got mine!

That the battery will always die at the worst possible moment (I miss my rechargeable ones) Forget having conversations in the car or when it’s windy.  I have a new pair with Bluetooth connectivity for the first time and didn’t realize people around me could hear when my phone ring in them until I was in a quiet meeting and got a phone call.

I always have to tell my family that the reason I don’t put in my hearing aids immediately when I get up in the morning, is because I have to adjust the world is loud enough as is and I really don’t need to be overwhelmed by how loud everything is when I’m trying to wake up and get out of bed

Hi SuperbFlounder,

My name is Aaryan, and I’m leading the development of a pair of headphones designed specifically for the Hard of Hearing community. This project is a collaboration with Logitech, and we’re focused on creating something that truly addresses the needs and challenges faced by HOH individuals.

To make sure we’re heading in the right direction, I would love to hear directly from you! I’m seeking volunteers for short interviews to share your experiences and insights on what could make headphones more effective or comfortable for daily use.

Whether it’s difficulties you’ve faced with traditional headphones, specific features you wish they had, or even general thoughts on assistive technology, your input would be invaluable to our design process.

If you’re interested, feel free to comment below or DM me, and we can set up a time that works best for you.

Thank you in advance for your time and insights!",2024-09-24 15:51:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1foftrz/things_nobody_tells_you_when_you_get_hearing_aids/

Your audiologist would be the best person to explain this to you

You have a reverse slope hearing loss, meaning that your low frequencies need to be turned up louder but as you go to higher and higher pitches, your hearing improves.

Those half square symbols mean it's check your underlying hearing which is actually fine, so it indicates a problem in your middle ear. 

Your audiologist should have performed tympanometry as they needed to find out if you have any middle ear effusion causing that raise in your hearing, despite the cochlea itself actually working well. 

TLDR, you have good underlying hearing but something is stopping the sounds coming through properly. Ask your audiologist for further testing/results from tympanometry

Moderate low frequency hearing loss, mild high frequency hearing loss. Your word recognition scores are perfect - when sound is amplified into an audible range, you have no trouble understanding what's being said. That makes you an excellent candidate for hearing aids.

Wow, about the same as me! Reverse slope hearing loss (~moderate low frequency loss, mild high frequency loss). I'm getting my first hearing aids in about a month. :)

Damn you can hear better than me lol

“Think I have a lousy audiologist” maybe it’s time to consider getting a new audiologist if this has been a consistent problem with your hearing aids

Maybe a bad audiologist?  But consider this: our son (18) wore Starkeys for about 7 years before we replaced them.  We originally went with Phonak.  He hated them.  He said the sound quality was completely different, and not in a good way.  The audiologist said that different manufacturers do have variation in their sound profiles, and not liking a certain brand is common.  He ended up with Resounds.  Sound is good, but not too impressed with the reliability.

That sounds like a setting that isn’t being done correctly.  Is the “snow” from your tinnitus, or something else?

Either way, they should be able to remove that.

I’ve used ear drops, but they don’t help much. I’ve been to the doctor twice for ear flushing and using a small machine to suction the wax from my right ear. While it helps a bit, it doesn’t permanently relieve the blocked feeling. For example, when I scratch the left side of my face, I can hear the sound just fine, but when I scratch the right side, it feels muffled, and I can’t hear as well on that side. Something is definitely off.

People suggest I see a specialist, but I’m wondering what they do differently from ear flushing or suctioning that might help relieve the clogged feeling.

I went to a regular doctor for years complaining about full ears. They did exactly what you mentioned without much fanfare and it didn’t take long. The specialist? All the same thing but I was in his office for *over an hour* getting it fixed. Never had an issue again. See a specialist.

Go to an ENT and make sure you mention that you’ve been trying to fix this for years and that your drs keep trying the same thing that doesn’t help. 

They don’t know it’s a reoccurring problem if you don’t emphasize it to them

The symptoms you describe could be from a number of conditions, not necessarily blocked ears.

I had similar symptoms. My audiologist sent me to an ENT specialist who was able to rule out anything serious and give me peace of mind.

1fn4j0j,hardofhearing,"Was I right to call him out, or did I overreact?","My hearing began declining about 20 years ago, shortly before I met my husband. He was made aware of that fact and in the past few years, the loss has gotten worse (now in the severe category) to the point where I now have hearing aids and can't hear much of anything without them. I still struggle with them in and my husband is fully aware of this. Over the course of our 18 years together, I've always made it very clear that I'm hard of hearing from day one, and he's even the one who suggested that I get hearing aids. Still, it's always been a struggle having to remind him and our children (14, 12) that if they have something to tell me, certain conditions must be met (need to be in same room, facing me, no mumbling, etc) unless they want me to ask them to repeat themselves. Before I got my HAs, things were very tense in our household because they were all getting tired of having to repeat themselves or dealing with mistakes I'd made due to mishearing and assuming I'd heard correctly. I've been extra diligent since to repeat what I thought I heard if I have any doubt so they can correct me if need be. There's still moments of frustration on both ends, but overall, the situation has improved 

Now onto today. I honestly don't remember what was said originally, but it was something trivial. My husband said something, I responded in a way that made no sense with what he'd said, and he snapped back with an irritated tone with ""I SAID *xyz*"" to which I responded, ""well, clearly, I misheard you"" He sighed, turned away and shook his head in that irritated way that people do when they're sick of your sh*t. I called him out and said ""don't you be shaking your head over me not hearing you correctly"" and he answered back with ""I can shake my head in frustration all I want""

So the question is, is he right? I know he's allowed to be frustrated, and it's perfectly understandable that he would be, but I can't help but feel massively disrespected as if my disability is such a burden on him or that he's somehow resentful or blaming me for the communication error like its my fault or that I chose to misinterpret what he said. Should I just keep quiet when he shows visible signs that he's annoyed or frustrated with my or my hearing?

I have been asking questions in this sub for a while and i got some help, really helped me to understand things I face daily. 

I have several questions arising in mind lately and I want to know from y'all. I have bilateral SNHL where left ear still within normal range and right ear is HoH. Have tinnitus as well. Tried HA and it made no great difference on Right ear. Often get headache a lot. 

Have spectacles - myopia 

So, right now after giving proper details, I wish to ask a few questions. 

1. Is it normal to have random headaches? Do you all face this? 

2. Being HoH or deaf isn't like a normal person with less sound ability? 

3. At what point the headache goes away? 

4. People with born hearing lost hearing, do they get headache as brain tries to understand each and every sound? At what point it's a life without sound? 

5. Are you'll sexually active and well performing? How has the prolong hearing loss related issues caused sexual issues? Or it never did at all? 

6. As known from many others, headache and rigid feeling due to hearing loss, many became exhausted. Is it new normal? Is there chances of death or other kind of failure? Like stroke or brain haemorrhage or such things? Poor brain plasticity? Or something? 



I'm sure I'm not the only person with all these questions. Please provide inputs and help a HoH brother.

1flubpo,hardofhearing,5 years no solution- Advice?,"Hey I don’t normally do this type of stuff but I need help and advice from people like me, or who may have or are struggling from similar things. Throughout my life, I’ve never passed a hearing test and in 2019 I was recommended to an ENT, which started this whole thing where I learned of my hearing loss. We’ve tried countless things over and over again, and they mention hearing aids but go around it or avoid it, and have me try things that never work. This is really starting to affect me and my mental health, and I just feel wrong and hate being left out of so much. But no one can listen or understand around me. I don’t know what to do, I have a second opinion coming up, but I don’t want to get my hopes up.

1flu6lc,hardofhearing,single cochlear implant update,"hi! i’ve posted a few times in here talking about my journey to seeing if i would qualify for a single cochlear implant. i had my evaluation today and im a candidate so my surgery is scheduled for november 18th!! (which is right after my 22nd birthday which is a little sucky but im still super excited!!) i posted in another group also but if anyone has any tips for post-op and recovery, im all ears! thank you so much in advance🫶

Audiologist here: Take the post-op recovery restrictions seriously. The cochlear implant wire is initially only held in place with some fat packed around the insertion site. The wire (array) can migrate out of the cochlea with too much physical activity or increased intracranial pressure (blowing your nose, bending over, lifting heavy objects). Eventually scar tissue will build up to keep the array in more securely. If the array migrates, you will likely have worse results with your CI or need a second surgery to replace the array. I've only seen it happen twice in 4 years as a CI audiologist, but it's very preventable if you follow the post op restrictions and recommendations. 

Also, some dizziness is very common after surgery! It usually resolves in a few days after surgery.

No tips here, but wishing you all the best with your upcoming surgery! Keep us posted, speedy recovery to you, and I hope you get wonderful results!

No tips but good luck on your surgery and recovery ! ❤️‍🩹 wish you all the best

1fj9la4,hardofhearing,Low- frequency hearing loss question,"If i listen to low-frequencies sounds loud enough to damage my hearing (105dB+), for example bass-heavy music, will i lose or damage my hearing on that frequency range? For example, if i listen to a 35hz tone, will i lose my hearing on 30-40hz tones? Or my hearing will be damaged on treble frequencies? So, will listening bass-heavy sounds affect my hearing only on the low-frequency spectrum, or it will only affect my treble hearing capacity? Or both?


[댓글]
Loud noise damages hearing so I assume it would damage your hearing (whether it would impact only low frequencies or treble I’m not confident in saying)

I wanted to know as well

I just operate on the mindset that music played too loud will damage your hearing. (I have low-freqency hearing loss as well).

I can’t hear low pitches,never could lol even with hearing aids",2024-09-17 20:16:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fj9la4/low_frequency_hearing_loss_question/
1fj2y3i,hardofhearing,"First hearing test, how severe is this? ","31, male, first test since I was in high school 

The ENT that did my test advised I get hearing aids, and that the damage is from nerves so nothing is reversible. Mentioned my results are opposite of most and I can hear higher pitches easier than lower. 

I struggle with understanding certain conversations, which can be frustrating but not something I can’t tolerate day to day. Some people (I assume deeper voices) are certainly harder to hear. 

Am I bad enough that hearing aids are required? I’m mostly worried about the issue becoming worse, and at first glance reading online it sounds like putting off hearing aids can cause my brain to “forget” speech recognition. Am I to this point now?

Moderate hearing loss in the low frequencies, rising to normal hearing in the high frequencies. This is an uncommon type of hearing loss - usually it's high frequency leading. 

&gt; Am I bad enough that hearing aids are required?

""Required"" isn't really the right way to approach hearing aids - they're never *required*. That said, you might find hearing aids helpful. I used to have an audiogram that looks very similar to yours (Meniere's disease), though mine has deteriorated to be more flat. I put off getting hearing aids for a decade but now absolutely swear by them, they're a huge improvement to my quality of life.

&gt; it sounds like putting off hearing aids can cause my brain to “forget” speech recognition. Am I to this point now?

Absolutely not, nowhere close. This only happens if you're functionally deaf, and over a long period of time. If you can still have a normal conversation and understand what's being said, you are at no immediate risk of language loss. 

If you decide you want to give hearing aids a try, a few tips:

* Assuming you're in the US, very, very few insurance companies cover hearing aids - you'll likely be paying out of pocket. A pair can run anywhere from $1000 for over the counter hearing aids (which I personally wouldn't recommend for your profile, but they're an option) up to $6000 for top-of-the-line behind the ear hearing aids with a service package (which are what I use and love). 
* Most audiologists will start you off on a loaner pair to try out. There's no commitment until you decide to buy, so there's little risk to giving them a shot for a month or two. 

I know this is a scary position to be in, I was where you are sitting years ago. Hearing loss is extremely manageable, and even if it deteriorates further there's an incredible amount of technology out there to help. My hearing loss is much worse and I live a very normal life. 

Best of luck. Feel free to reach out with any other questions.

I would get hearing aids. It will improve your quality of life. 

My hearing test is down near the 90-110 range in basically a line straight across for both ears. I wear hearing aids in and I can follow along with conversation if I put an effort into it which is helpful. You'll probably get better results than me using them and I'm able to live a somewhat normal life.

My child has “mild loss” - and let me be clear: ANY loss is significant.

My child got hearing aids a year after diagnosis and it has changed their world.

I know they’re expensive but I think it’s worth trying.

I frequently use my airpods as hearing aids.  They are a bit weak for me, but my hearing loss is a bit more profound.  You can find tutorials on how to use airpods as hearing aids.  I don't live in the US, but i believe there should be audiologists that let you demo hearing aids to make sure they are right for you.

I also have reverse slope hearing loss.  I just did trials of all the top hearing aids, and found the WIDEX to be the best.   Apparently, they are favoured by musicians because they can selectively amplify low frequency sounds.

I have almost the exact same audiogram. My hearing loss is caused by a rare genetic defect that runs in my family. I used to wear Siemens behind the ear hearing aids but I stopped because I hated wearing them, they didnt work so well for the low frequencies (hearing aids are primarily designed to amplify high frequencies), and I got good enough at lip reading that I didn’t have a problem most of the time. 

I don’t want to discourage you from getting hearing aids though. If you find a hearing aid that works good for low frequencies (or if anyone else has recs) please let me know!

Moderate loss in lower frequencies. You’d do well with hearing aids if you’d like them. Id recommend it. I’m 34, with sharper slope but going in the other direction, from moderate to severe/profound.

That's a classic hearing loss pattern seen in Meniere's, but you don't report any vestibular symptoms so.. all good.

Yes, you would benefit tremendously from hearing aids. You may delay it as long as you want, but there would be noticeable benefits in your speech recognition.

I remember getting my first hearing test as an adult and told I had a hearing loss I was in my 20’s I was devastated. There was no explanation why and that’s what scared me. I kept losing my hearing. The hearing aids did help until they didn’t but I adapted and actually enjoyed some of the silence. I now have a cochlear implant which is great. It breaks down sometimes and it’s not 100% normal hearing but it is to me and I don’t even feel deaf most days. Best part when I don’t want to hear I can take it off

Wow, that’s pretty significant for RSHL! Sometimes the audiogram underestimates the low frequency loss if there’s any upward spread of excitation also.

1fh6t5p,hardofhearing,Shallow ear plugs? ,"Does anyone know if there is a product that is essentially a flat or short ear plug that still allows space in my ear to fit conventional earbuds like 1st Gen airpods.  I have been sticking small pieces of tissue paper inside my ear canal whenever I go for walks in the city. But I like to listen to music so I wear my airpods over the balled up tissue that sits in my canal. Weird yes but I can't stand active or passive noise cancelling earbuds. Or any in-ear earbud that deep dive into the canal. They are very uncomfortable and I get feedback ""thumps"" from my footsteps.  I feel like having some layer of hearing protection underneath a conventional earbud allows me to enjoy music out in the public but not continue to damage my hearing by being fully exposed to modified exhaust systems that are prevalent in my area.  I could of course just continue to ball up small pieces of tissue in my ear canal. But was wondering if there are better options or techniques out there

[댓글]
You could try the wax ear plugs that you can mold to just fit over your earbuds. Alternatively, if you don't like sticking earbuds in your ears, you could use over the ear  headphones. They make really cheap ones like Skullcandy or if you have the funds, expensive ones have noise cancelling tech (I can't tell by your post if you don't like noise cancelling tech in general or specifically earbuds with noise cancelling tech).

That said, please don't risk damage to your ears by sticking small things in your ear canals that could break off/get stuck/etc.

In all seriousness switch to over ear headphones and stop trying to shove a bunch of extra stuff in your ears. You can easily get over ear headphones for the same price as AirPods and they’ll have a degree of outside noise reduction built in. [Earbuds are also considered more dangerous to your hearing as a whole because they go in your ear canal, by switching to over ear headphones you’re potentially preventing more hearing loss.](https://www.audiologycharlotte.com/blog/beware-the-hidden-dangers-of-headphones-and-earbuds)

You could go with bone conduction headphones and earplugs. Some of those are pretty discreet.",2024-09-15 07:15:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fh6t5p/shallow_ear_plugs/
1fgxycc,hardofhearing,hearing aid appearance ,"I’m 16 and have been diagnosed with mild-moderate hearing loss. I’m going to be hooked up with hearing aids soon and my doctors are pushing me to go for the “invisible” style. I feel like if i’m going to have hearing aids why not get visible/external ones and show them off. I’ve always thought they were super cool. is that bad? or unusual? i don’t want to offend anyone. another part of my desire for visible hearing aids is that i could match with my deaf cousin, who is 7, and maybe make him feel a little less different and self conscious. id love advice! 

edit for typo

[댓글]
I don't think there's anything wrong with any type of aid! It's all about preference. My daughter likes the way the full molds feel and how they sound, that getting to pick fun colors and sparkles are a huge bonus. Get whatever you want, you're the one wearing them!

I wonder why your AuD is pushing for that type? Sounds like you need to have a convo with them and hear them out so they can hear you.

I was pushed to get hearing aids that matched my hair color, and I still regret it. Do whatever makes you happy!

The doctor may be ""pushing"" that option because they assume a teenager wouldn't want a visible aid and that having an invisible one would make them more likely to use the item. But- I say go for the visible one! Sometimes it's better to have your ""disability"" be visible so that others will be more aware of your needs. 

As someone with both visible and non-visible disabilities I can guarantee that having something about you that is easily discernible will make it much more to get assistance and proper treatment. When I got my hearing aids at 31, I opted for visible options for that reason. People notice and I can talk to them about my experience and needs as well as those of the community at large.

Honestly, most Audis don’t get what it’s like to have hearing aids. I prefer mine to be seen .. ok my ha and ci now .. but if they are seen, some people become aware that you might need them to…slow down, face me and be close. All the better to hear you…. I have had quite a few instances where people have actually stopped and been very supportive once they saw I was hoh.

So in my opinion, seeing is believing. Do what you are most comfortable with, I have found them being visible helps.

I don’t see the issue at all. I was in 1st grade when the first other student got his hearing aids, I was *jealous* the day he came in and they were *Nintendo 64* green.

I wish I could get hearing aids that were bright red! I want people to know and to destigmatize them.

All just preference.
Ds18 had his first pair of hearing aids just prior to 3rd grade. At that age, the audiologist said behind-the-ear was their only option, as his ears were still growing. Once he hit 17, they said he’d now qualify to get invisible ones. He refused, saying, “This is who I am. I’m not interested in hiding who I am.”
Fair enough!
Do what makes you feel good! There are tons of colors and covers/decals, if you want to show them off. 
Also, I love that you are thinking of your cousin. You are setting a great example!

Not bad or unusual. Same boat as you and could be comfortably fit in RIC (less visible) or BTE (more visible) hearing aids. My first pair were RIC and for a multitude of reasons, one of which was DEFINITELY picking fun colors and glitter, I switched to BTE for my latest pair. I’m proud of them and you should be too! Rock those bright ones and ignore what the aud says about discretion. You (or insurance) are paying a lot of money for them, get whatever tf you want (that will work for you lol)!

I would go with whatever work best for your hearing. If you want pizzazz, go for it. 

The behind the ear part of my first set were clear. I loved it. I could see all the mechanics. Now where I get them I can only get boring natural colors. My kiddo has hot pink ear molds. In the military since everybody has to be the same with what they wear when people need hearing aids they often have fun going crazy with whatever colors they want.

Not bad or unusual at all. In my opinion if you're going to have some kind of disability aid you might as well make it fun. It's totally up to the person though, just whatever makes them happy. If anything it is weird your doctor is pushing one way or the other.

I’ve had HAs since I was six, I’m now eighteen. I’ve had three different pairs over the years, the first two BTEs and my most recent one RICs. I personally hate my RICs and feel as though I would have made the decision not to switch to them if I had had more information (I was told that all the problems I had during the trial period would go away if I got custom ear molds, but that wasn’t the case). I don’t recommend switching the type of HAs you use unless you can have a trial period with them, and if you find any issues don’t let the audiologist downplay them. One decision I did make was to go with neutral colors to help with professionalism, (note neutral, not skin tone) I would still make that choice, but for a different reason. Fuck professionalism, but having black HAs means that they don’t get stained by my colored hair. I would say if you plan on getting a job soon, a more neutral color might be something you want to think about

I'm getting my first pair in a couple of weeks.  I was/am afraid of having my ear blocked up, would cause pain on my left side.  So, BTE are the best option for me.  Still, as a girl, I have a choice as to whether I show them or not.  

It's nice that you don't want to hide your HAs for your cousin.  Also, just nice to have a family member who understands.

I would guess they are just used to people wanting to have them hidden so if you’re really sure about wanting them visible, just assure your AuD that you’ve thought about it a lot and you’re confident in your decision and unless there’s a medical reason for the type of aid, they should respect your decision!

Don't forget to google Hearing Aid Jewellery! There's heaps of options to bling up your hearing aids.

There's no wrong way to get hearing aids. I personally adore hearing aids with variations/customizations. When I was younger, I'd have the option to get stickers for them / specific colored ones. Nowadays my present ones while great are lacking in them and are boring design wise. Also for my early years hearing aids, my mom attached them on a pink string in order to keep them connected/together so I wouldn't lose them. She'd put beads on them for the flair and I remember one time, a girl at my school thought it was a necklace from the back.

I think it's adorable to match with other disabled people and generally cool to customize your aids.

Hearing aids could achieve greater things if we all wanted them to be bigger. But companies believe we want them hidden.

Don't get invisible hearing aids unless you want an invisible benefit from them

Ugh I would be thrilled to have someone want a hearing aid that is the totally visible kind 🤣😭

I love decorating my hearing aids! I have the ones that have the wire so I put a tube twist on it so it’s my favorite color and stands out. I love it. I say go for it!

It’s preference really. I prefer the full moulds but I’m a grown up so they don’t let me get sparkly colourful ones. Instead I add little twisty things to the tube or hearing aid jewellery to them. You’ll likely have some form of them forever, they just need to be something you are comfortable with and like

I love that you want to be supportive of your cousin! I thoroughly believe in visibility for hearing aids to help eliminate the stigma of deafness. I decorate my HAs with washi tape, nail stickers and charms and talk about having them often

Totally go for what you want. The stigma around hearing aids is absolutely ridiculous and I just don’t understand why the medical professionals would push us into being more stigmatized. It’s so super obvious it’s much healthier to just accept hearing aids as the tool they are and that definitely can and should be used for personal expression. They are just a piece of electronics, just like tons of other equipment we use to make life easier in various ways.

I was pushed to get the well hidden ones and got some cool wraps for them because I wanted them to be more visible. Right now I’ve got iridescent wrapping around the tube which is fun, but I wish the body were more visible too sometimes!

Edit: You can get colorful wraps on Etsy for the tubing if you end up with the tiny invisible device. There’s also charms you can hang from them too.

Example: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1482981268/

They're you're devices, get them however you want! I ended up picking a color I liked that happened to blend in with my hair - that's not the reason I picked that color, though. Do you! Be bold!

I’m 24, got my OTE at 21. IT IS COOL. it helps raise awareness, reduce stigma, and protects you from being pushed in the pool. lol. most people don’t realize they’re on, and if they do - they think they’re earbuds (idfk) until I take them out. do ittttttt it also makes your life a little easier with a visible disability

I wear glasses and the smaller behind the ear version is nicer, less in the way. However, my hearing is more profound and the peice inside my ear should be bigger to help with the sound better. The one i have is not the perfect fit for me. Make sure whatever you get is the most helpful, everything else is just your choice! Nothing wrong with wanting to be more obvious with your hearing. If mine stood out more, i wonder if it would save me more energy that they see it rather than me going, ""hi im hard of hearing"" cause they can't see the smaller one.

I got my first hearing aid (over-the-ear) at 17. Honestly, no one I didn’t tell realized! And this is when there weren’t other color options at my audiologist’s other than tan. (Kids’ ones came in other colors and I was kinda jealous. I’ve worn OTE brown ones the color of my hair for a long time now, but sometimes I still consider a fun color!)

I still remember that in my senior year of high school, I had younger friends from band who had no idea that I had them (had two by then). 

A lot of older people are really self-conscious about getting them and I’ve convinced some I knew that it was worth it.

I like having visible aids, it relieves some of the need of telling people I'm hard of hearing, because even with aides my hearing isn't normal.

For years i used the invisible type, worried about what people would think, then i started thinking your wny and it has been fantastic.
I'm not sure what the docs are thinking, but you've got it right -- show them off!

I was actually thinking how cool it would be to make DIY kits to modify the hearing aid's appearance: we could have so many options: cartoons, Marval characters, hot pink with zebra stripes...

When I got my first hearing aids, I was always hiding them, just because I was too embarrassed (I was still young). A few years later, we moved from a bigger city to a small village, where everyone knew everyone.
Coincidentally, both children of one of our neighbors, wore hearing aids. The daughter had red BTEs with red ear moulds. The son had blue and blue. Both of them teenagers. And both of them totally open and upfront about their hearing loss.
That was the moment when I thought, OK, if they can do it, I can do it as well. And so I started to wear coloured ear moulds and got coloured hearing aids with my next fitting, too. I had black/silver, translucent blue and now black ones with black moulds.
And the really funny thing: It felt a lot easier to go into public with coloured hearing aids, than with ""invisible"" ones.
So, if you feel like it, go for it!

I see no problem. I was disappointed when I got my first HAs at 18 and my only options were beige and silver. (I got RICs, so colorful molds weren't an option!) I don't know why your doctor is pushing it. That seems unusual. Are you getting RIC or BTE aids? If you have dark hair, maybe you could get hearing aids that match with your hair color and then get molds any color so they could be discrete one day if you desire?

My hearing aid specialist recommended me to get them to match my hair color to hide them, said that most people my age do (I was 18).

I honestly regret it. I had to tell anyone anyways, and while brown hearing aids are cute in their own way, I found myself trying to find hearing aid skins to change the color to something I like

I'm 18 and have had hearing aids.since I was 12. At first the ear piece was purple with glitter and there were red stickers on it. Then I got new ones, red with stars on it. I think they're cool too. You gotta live with them, if you want them visible, then have them be visible! Nothing wrong with that at all.

i don’t think that’s bad at all!! i have an “invisible style” one but it’s still visible and i love it. it’s small ofc but you can really see it when i have my hair up (: makes me feel cool 😎 being proud breaks the stigma for everyone, it’s awesome that you’d want to take pride in your hearing aids!!

BTE-behind the ear and RIC-receiver in canal house the most powerful components including longer life battery, more powerful chips/volume and frequency enhancement, etc.

Your selection of format is pragmatically optimal.",2024-09-14 22:38:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fgxycc/hearing_aid_appearance/

I would kill to have your hearing level bro

Hearing aid specialist here. No, this isn't bad even at your young age. However, you should keep an eye on it and get tested every 2-3 years. 30db is considered normal/ bordering on very mild loss.

High frequencies are naturally the first to decline with age. Consonants in speech (t, f, th, s, sh) fall in the high frequency range. So a high frequency loss may result in missing some of those sounds and a lack of clarity. You probably won't notice it until it gets really bad. But just because you don't notice it doesn't mean you shouldn't treat it. There's a strong link between untreated hearing loss and cognitive decline. All those little sounds that you don't even notice you're missing stimulate the brain.

I was told anything from 10-30 is relatively normal so you’re hearing seems fine atm but it for sure tapers down further on the right. Might be something to watch out incase your hearing starts getting worse 

My hearing does the same at 1khz my right ear is 60db while my left is 40db. I have no idea why there is such a discrepancy

can we switch ears 😂

It's not about age, it's about health and luck / life.

Regarding the loss on one ear:
Are or have you been a farmer and do you tilt your head to the left when looking backwards?

What do you do for work? Are you exposed to any high frequency loud noise?

I can’t link it from Amazon, but search the dreamsky alarm. It’s 25 bucks and works like a charm.  Just chose the vibration setting and slide it inside your pillow case.

The charge lasts like 2 months.

I started sleeping with my hearing aids on when my latest son was born so I could hear him cry. I discovered that my phone’s Bluetooth connection worked with alarms. So I just use the iPhone’s clock app and set multiple alarms. 

I also sleep wearing my Apple Watch. The vibration of the alarm wakes me up

1ff6vcs,hardofhearing,Thoughts on the cochlear implant?,"Hi so I honestly have no idea when I started to loose my hearing and I first found out almost 5 years ago and my hearing is getting worse but it also fluctuates through out the day. 

A few days ago I went to see a specialist (ear,nose, throat doctor) and he can to the conclusion that my hearing loss is from nerve damage. He also heavily recommended (almost insisting) I get the implant to ‘cure’ me of my hearing loss. but I have a lot of concerns as here in Canada the procedure is not done that much (I also don’t trust Canadian drs). 

I do normally wear hearing aids and just want to get new ones. If there is anyone in this subreddit who has had the procedure done could you tell me what it was like and if you regret getting it done and also how it feels wearing them all the time? 

TIA

I personally don’t have a cochlear implant but I heard it’s definitely not a cure for hearing loss. People still struggle with hearing/understanding people. One person explained it that she can’t filter noise and everything is on the same level of volume. Another one explained it as instead of being fully deaf she’s more of hard of hearing and still needs to be able to read lips to understand you.

You might want to head over to r/cochlearimplants since more people have experience with that.

i would talk to an audiologist before you decide anything

Yeah CIs don’t “cure” deafness. R/deaf will tell you that real quick.

I knew a girl in high school who had one. She seemed fine unless she was in a loud room (a gym class, prom, etc) where she preferred to take it out. Since a 2nd cousin does the same thing with her hearing aids in similar circumstances I’m guessing that’s something you know about already. 

Definitely wouldn’t view it as a cure though. I’d definitely not go back to that audiologist.

Late-deafened adult, bilateral CI user here, and no regrets at all.

No, they're not perfect. Yes, background noise, crowds, etc. can be a problem. No, they're not the same as normal hearing...but they allow me to live a fairly normal life. It's way better than being deaf.

I know a lot of deaf/HOH people insist that CIs are not a cure for deafness, and that's technically true: without my processors, I am, in fact, deaf. However, when I have them on, I have a word recognition score in the 90s, and sentence recognition nearly 100% in quiet. I would compare them more to a prosthetic leg: having one doesn't mean you aren't an amputee, but it allows you to live almost as if you weren't.

You will lose whatever hearing you have left if you go that route

Have you had a hearing aid yet? I had SSNHL and at my first appointment they told me I was a CI candidate and pushed that. I ended up getting a second opinion from a university hospital ENT who was shocked and told me they don’t recommend those until at least six months after sudden hearing loss and exploring other options. Also- potential treatments are (always) on the horizon- a CI operation severs the nerve so I could never potentially be able to benefit if a good treatment was found.

There are doctors at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto who ONLY do cochlear implant surgery.   You would be in good hands there.

Wish I could have gotten it.  Lost hearing on one side with covid complications.  I wasn't able to access care fast enough.  Fuck new brunswick.",2024-09-12 16:32:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ff6vcs/thoughts_on_the_cochlear_implant/

“Free hearing exams done from your phone” sorry for the stupid but what exactly would that entail? I have the pros and the settings allow you to modify the sound. This is done by playing two variations of a ringtone and you select 1 or 2. I wonder if the pro 2s will do the same or if it will be more like a beep test. I currently have my pros set to my audiogram and, as much as I love earphones, I will likely hold off on getting the pro 2s. For financial reasons plus I only got my pros around the start of summer this year and I haven’t yet had a full work up by an audiologist

Concerns: only works for mild/moderate HL, can't use these as hearing aids ALL THE TIME because of 4-6 hrs battery life.

Questions: with the AirPods already having 6 hrs of battery life before dying, how will this feature impact it, if it does at all?

I’m excited to try them. I’m a student, and I’m buying a new MacBook Air (with refund money), from the Apple Education Store, which means I’ll get a 250$ gift card to use at Apple. 

So I only need to pay taxes to get these AirPods. I just checked and taxes would be 22.16 USD. 

My concern is privacy. My hearing test is a medical record that would now be stored at Apple instead of a doctor’s office.

I am interested in seeing how the update is as I have been using my pros as hearing aides for nearly a year. So hopefully it will be better then now.

I can't see them replacing my Sony CRE-E10s. I can stream through my IPad for around 12 hours and without streaming they last nearly 24 hours. I have to be able to hear more than four hours a day so a hard pass for me.

I'd be curious how they deal with feedback and occlusion. If you close the ear canal, there can be occlusion. If you amplify sound, there could be feedback. 

I don't think Apple will appreciate the thought of peoples Airpods giving off feedback.",2024-09-12 16:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ff65ud/airpods_pro_2_hearing_aids_update/
1ff32mv,hardofhearing,HOH kid’s classroom accessibility ,"My 5 yo with HOH started kindergarten last week. Today he said he did not want to go to school because it was too loud. He has hearing aids. Do folks know of any sound engineers or programs that offer sound accessibility consultations to parents and schools? Need to consult one to make my son's new kindergarten classroom more acoustically welcoming. He’s been complaining about it being too loud with this hearing aids (he lost some hearing with chemo treatment). He's too young to adjust dB levels on phone app and we're not supposed to do it because we are not the ones wearing the aids. Our Audiologist (not school audiologist) recommended demanding a more acoustically accessible classroom space—this is in addition to reviewing his levels. Want to get opinions outside of school for how to achieve this. Any ideas of someone or orgs that can help me? We are in Northeast USA. 

[댓글]
Do you have the recommendations in writing from the audiologist for a more acoustically accessible classroom and someone to help adjust his HA levels at school?  You could send this information to the school and request your child be evaluated to see if they qualify for accommodations and services under a 504 plan and/or IEP.  In some states (like MA), audiology services at school would likely require an IEP.  I know you want an outside opinion, but chances are the school would want to do their own evaluation before agreeing to make any substantial changes anyway.  You could maybe start by having a conversation with the school districts director of special education to explain your concerns and see what they suggest you do for next steps.

Other ideas / orgs you could follow up with:  find a local educational audiologist to do a private eval, Easter Seals, your state's organization for deaf / HOH, ask the audiologist for who they recommend.  FWIW, you might find that the wait for a private evaluation is way longer than just going to the school where there are set timelines for completing a SPED evaluation.

Second the earlier comment-- your kiddo has a disability (hearing loss) the way you deal with that in a school setting is with an IEP.

For young children, help adjusting hearing aid (HA) volume is a very common accommodation. Do your son's HAs have a physical volume control? I've never heard that parents and teachers shouldn't help a small child adjust their HAs; did the audiologist tell you that?

Also, how long has your son had HAs?

Hey , I’ve worn HAs my whole life. 

There are some rooms that I go in where I have to turn the hearing aids into “noisy environment” mode. It blocks out all excessive background noise. 

Also it is possible they have his HAs programmed too loud. This happened to me a couple years ago and it was driving me batty. I had to go to a new audiologist and she said they were turned up WAY too loud for my needs. At first I didn’t believe her, but she turned them down and I’m shocked how much better I hear now.",2024-09-12 13:51:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ff32mv/hoh_kids_classroom_accessibility/
1feus9v,hardofhearing,Tympanoplasty- local vs general anesthesia ,"I had two tympanoplasties as a young person. Now at 44, my ear drum is full of scar tissue and bone overgrowth? and I can't hear shit. I've been avoiding the surgery I need to remove the material and restore my hearing because of ptsd related to having so many surgeries as a child. But it's time. General anesthesia makes me pretty sick and I hate throwing up on top of everything else. I also have nightmares about the mask and the feeling of breathing in this toxic gas. My surgeon recommended local anesthesia instead, but said I would be aware of the injection, which will be pretty much right into my ear drum. It will hurt, but I won't remember it. And then, I'll be aware of what's happening. Has anyone done this surgery with local/twilight anesthesia? Any words of encouragement or advice? Thanks in advance. I'm trying to get past my fear but really struggling.

1fe6u8o,hardofhearing,Advice for earbuds w/ loss high frequency,"Hi all! 
Just joined the community, happy to have found you. 
I am HoH with dual steep decline in frequencies &gt; ~1000 hz (if I'm reading my audiogram correctly, enclosed for clarity), along with a buckload of tinnitus. I try to wear my hearing aids (first pair in 2016, 2nd pair just in) and they do have Bluetooth, but it is not ideal. Because of the loss in high frequencies, I have a hard time with discerning speech and I much prefer my in-ear, noise-cancelling wireless earbuds for isolating audio. But they are old and worn down and I am looking to buy a new pair. 
Does anybody have any advice regarding what brand or product would suit my needs best? I am curious across all budgets to learn what is best, but in reality would be comfortable spending up to 50/75€. 
I realize I am lucky to still be able to listen to podcasts/audiobooks at all, but this only works for me in a quiet environment, when it is a clear recording, when I sort of know the context and generally if it is by a male speaker (which really frustrates me as a woman ':)). 
Thanks so much if you can and want to share some advice :)

Sorry for the long message - tldr: looking for wireless earbuds with hearing loss at ~1000hz :)

Earbud and OTC hearing aids can help with mild to moderate loss. Your hearing loss goes into the severe-profound range, so you will not get any benefit from these products. You need high powered prescription hearing aids.

Apple just came out with earbuds that qualify as OTC hearing aids.   I don't use apply, but that's where I'd start.  I think they can be purchased starting 9/13.",2024-09-11 10:29:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fe6u8o/advice_for_earbuds_w_loss_high_frequency/

1fdqcmk,hardofhearing,Did I ruin my toddler's life?,"I'm sitting here typing this and crying.

My 3.5 year old passed his newborn hearing test. As he got older he had attention issues, couldn't focus on anything, speech delayed too. He got tubes put in his ears 16 months ago but they didn't really do much.

For 16 months after that, I feel like we didn't advocate for our son properly to get a sedated hearing test to figure out what was going on. We did like 6 hearing tests at the ENTs office but those are so dumb cause they're so highly dependent on toddler behavior.

Today we went to a pediatric audiologist who did some tests and said he probably has some mild hearing loss. We're going to do a sedated one in 5 weeks.

I just feel like we bypassed so much of critical child development months. I feel like an awful father. I hate myself for waiting this long. The kid has been struggling for so long, only starting to get some words a few months ago with intensive speech therapy, and I didn't push for my son as hard as I should have to get what he needed.

I didn’t get hearing aids until I was 4. Hearing tests for new borns wasn’t a thing when I was born. I went to a school for mentally challenged kids until they figured out I was actually HOH. The state provided someone to work with me to catch up anything I missed and I did speech therapy for a year or so. I’m now 24 and have a degree in geophysics. The one thing I regret is my parents not having me learn to sign. It wasn’t necessary and still isn’t but as a life long HOHer I wish I could sign and will learn soon. Anyway you didn’t ruin anything and you have plenty of time. Kids are resilient and catching up is easy for them

I think youre doing everything you can.

I didnt get diagnosed till i was 5, and my mom is HoH too, so. 
I had speech therapy to catch up, and now i communicate just fine!

It's okay, take a deep breath. You're doing your best and you sound like a great parent. You've found it now and you're doing something about it, that's what counts. 😊

You’re not a bad dad. I’m HoH and it’s hereditary and so I get my five year old tested regularly. But you’re right those tests are so subjective even at five. Being a parent in a world that doesn’t support parents is hard. Give yourself some grace. I’m sorry you’re going through this. It’s never too late to advocate for your child and I think insisting on better thorough testing is the right thing to do. ❤️❤️🥺

You’re doing the best you can with the resources and information you had at the time. Some children don’t get diagnosed till much later in life. You’re getting the testing done now and that’s what matters.

My son is 19 months and has bilateral moderate to severe SNHL. He wears hearing aids and is learning sign language and is in speech therapy. 

I thought I ruined my life as well when he was diagnosed and born honestly. He was born 16 weeks premature, has had a lot of medical history. He’s one of the smartest and bravest  kids I’ve met. 

As parents we always want what’s best for our children and that’s what you have been doing. Continue to advocate

[deleted]

Absolutely not. You’re doing the best you can, and being an advocate for him is a powerful thing. 

I didn’t get hearing aids until after I moved out of my parents house because my parents just ignored my hearing loss. This is not an uncommon story for people, especially those who are in the mild/moderate ranges of hearing  loss. 

I now have hearing aids, know sign language (started learning after I moved out, also, and it was the best choice I’ve ever made for myself), work happily and successfully in healthcare, and have wonderful friends since I’m involved in the D/HoH community.

You’re doing the best you can. You haven’t ruined anything. I had a speech impediment because I was HOH. I failed several hearing tests as a kid and teen but my parents insisted it was stubbornness so I didn’t get hearing aids until I was an adult. Your son will be okay.

My mom was in a similar situation when I was a toddler. She was doing the best she could with what she had, and I don't blame her one bit. Don't be so hard on yourself.

Can't state how much I appreciate all the stories and the reassurance. Y'all are wonderful.

You did the absolute best you could with the information you were given by professionals at the time.   Kids are so resilient and can catch up fast.  I'm 57 and wasn't diagnosed until my late 40's, Congenital, Bilateral, Cookie Bite SNHL.  Our brains are amazing at helping us fill in the gaps prior to diagnosis in a lot of cases.  Just know that no matter what there is a loving supportive family around him, and that you've provided that!

🫂

A lot of people have tried to be reassuring - so let me be blunt. No. And for a simple reason.

Humans are resilient and very flexible. They can recover from a lot. Perhaps he hasn't been given the best start but there is plenty of room for bounce-back.

I strongly suggest you try learning some signs with him. Even if he can hear words (etc), his hearing will likely be his weakest sense, and sign language can be a great tool for communicating when hearing fails.  Sign language also has proven benefits for deaf and hard of hearing children's mental health, learning development and language development (including reading and speech).

HOH, now an adult. I swear I had hearing issues when I was younger and my parents didn’t take it seriously. Same with glasses. I’m a successful adult now who wears hearing aids and communicates just fine. You sound like an involved and caring father, and this is not your fault. At all. I want to echo others that I wish I had learned sign language. I am trying now but much harder to pick up as an adult.

I didn’t get diagnosed until I was 3, and I had a cookie bite loss up to 80dB at the time.
Got my hearing aids when I was 3.5yo and people won’t recognize that I have a hearing loss when I’m speaking, my voice is normal. I got speech therapy when I was 4 and 5 and went to a special school for a couple of years.

And why didn’t my parents know? Well I did come to the table when we had to have dinner, it seemed like I was listening ‘fine’ and despite that I have 3 older siblings with good hearing my parents just recognized it very lately. And very honestly my parent’s expectations were a bit skewed due to the following:

Multiple doctors didn’t recognize it, I was born prematurely for 10 weeks, which was quite a lot in the 80s. During multiple tests they just thought I was retarded. They even told my parents I would never be able to bike, or sit on my own, because my balance was really poor. (My hearing problem is in the cochlea, so it makes sense after all)..

I’m 37 now and living my life just fine. I graduated university and have good job, despite ‘missing’ those first couple of years. And I could bike before the age of 4 ;).

Please repost this in r/deaf. Your son needs to start learning to sign. It will help him so much to catch up communicating at an age appropriate level. Don't let any naysayers try to deter you away from signing with your son

I'm similar to your son, very very bad ear infections, had mild to moderate hearing impairment while dealing with all the infections and tubes. I had some mild delays, a few speech issues I did speech therapy to fix in elementary. 

It was the 80s a sedated hearing test didn't exist yet. I can say my hearing tests were always pretty accurate and reflected how bad my middle ear disease was in the moment. I had so many I have very solid memories of being in the booth 😂 and my peds versus normal hearing tests.

I'd be more concerned there may be other co-ocurring issues playing a role in some of this. I also have ADHD and am mildly dyslexic. Ironically while my brother and mom have a lot of speech issues with dyslexia, me the one with HOH doesn't? I just needed help with my S's.

What I wish we had the ability to know is that I have a rare genetic disease that was causing the infections to begin with, and may be the reason for my ADHD and spectrumy traits since I had fevers regular in the 105s some that almost killed me that got to 108. So my brain got a bit crispy. I see no fault in it since the disease didn't have a name and not of its underlying mechanism was known of when I was a child. But had I somehow gotten the knowledge before it came back in adulthood I'd be in better shape, my ears definitely would be since now I have inner ear disease too :/ but it's thankfully well controlled so still mild loss on the left and moderate permanently on the right.

All this to say you didn't screw up. No kids come with a manual, those of us with medical issues definitely don't. Sadly many doctors won't / can't say it, but there is so much we simply do not know, doctors also don't get a manual or crystal ball, they can just do their best. 

Additionally, as a kid who got tubes and needed surgical removal for one (ofc my right ear, always my right 😂) sedation was super traumatic and scary for me. Obviously when it's necessary it's necessary. But it's also sensible to not go for that option right away and wait until it's clinically indicated. It's a big thing to do with a toddler. Also we tend to know things when it's time. Tests are only as useful as the ability to interpret them. Imagine doing a sedated test that was done poorly with an anemic report, and since it was done and ""clean"" people writing it off and not wanting to repeat it. Now there's a good ent on board who has a plan and knows what they are looking for.

I had a diagnosis when I was 7 or 8. I didn’t get hearing aids until I bought them for myself…30 years later. 

My hearing loss may have happened closer to my diagnosis which would affect development differently. But while I get angry about it sometimes (for a number of reasons) I turned out ok. I even got a Master’s degree before I had them.

Awful fathers don't feel like awful fathers.

So firstly, no you didn't ruin anything at all (as others have said). It's still very early and you're doing things exactly right by paying close attention and researching. 

However, I would like you to take something away from this moment. Remember that feeling you had when you were pretty sure that they should be doing a better hearing test, but you doubted yourself bc the experts dismissed it?  That's every day in the world of a disability unfortunately.  

I know you feel guilty for not listening to your instincts this time; it's okay and things are going to be fine. But do let it be a guide for you in the future: when experts are making you feel dismissed, get all the information you can and push for what you know is needed. It doesn't mean you ignore knowledgeable people, but it means you aren't afraid to seem annoying or pushy. 

As an adult with hearing loss, it's the number one thing I learned from my mother--I was never embarrassed or afraid to ask for captions at my job, or to request a seat in the front for college lectures, or to be firm with my doctors because she was always confident and assertive on my behalf as a kid.

I didn't get diagnosed until I was about 3.5 and I don't blame my parents. I blame the doctor who kept saying I'd grow out of not being able to talk correctly and the school system who talked my parents out of teaching me sign language as a young kid. My Dad is HoH but we're the only two who have issues and I had a bilateral hearing loss from birth where he only had it in one ear until an accident at work. My parents were trying their best and you are too

You are doing the best you know how to do each day.  This included surgery and hearing tests.  Guided I would imagine by someone who had their doctorate.  How reasonable is it for you to expect more of yourself than a doctor?  From my perspective, you are a wonderful caring parent who is actively working to protect and preserve their child's hearing.

I failed a hearing test at age 5 in kindergarten.  My Mom didn't notice the hearing loss, and I imagine I had very little hearing on the one side.  It turns out I had CST.  Mom fought for me, contrary to advice she received at the time.  Doing that saved my life. 

I learned to speak normally despite the undiagnosed hearing loss.  A couple of my first words were No! And Me do! Or I'll do it myself.  I imagine my Mom regretted the little chatterbox I became and a rather independent one, too.  I did tend to be quiet in group situations.   That is a challenging listening environment.

You did the absolutely the most important thing, and that was to protect and preserve your child's hearing and health.  That is more important than the ability to hear.  It sounds like your child is healthy and their hearing stable.  Get whatever hearing test is needed and decide if HAs are appropriate.

The language window is about until 7 years old so you have enough time to catch up, no worries there. I had a speech delay that was unrelated to my hearing loss and thanks to years of intensive speech therapy I’m talking like any human being

Your fine. He has probably already learned to adapst, which is goid.

I didn't get diagnosed until I failed kindergarten. I adapted far too well that no one knew until my teacher realized I was watching the other kids for queues. They wanted to hold me back and send me to a separate school. My parents said no and got me a summer tutor to catch up.

Started first grade lowest in everything (no test to see where I was at). I took home the reading textbook (a see spot run type that progressed to full stories), read it, and handed it to the teacher and told her I was done. She had me read one of the last pages. I did. They decided to test to see where my skills were at at that point. Lol The only change from other kids was someone who made sure I understood everything at the end of the day and speech therapy until high school.

Biggest take away, advocate for him when he hits school. That's where he'll need it.

“Mild hearing loss” wouldn’t ruin a child’s life because they didn’t have hearing aids. Both my boys were speech delayed. The oldest is at “the lower end of normal” for hearing. He’s normal and I think it’s allergies and sinus issues (he displays the same symptoms I have of chronic sinus issues). The other one has so far passed the hearing tests…but he’s 2. lol. So no guarantees. He’s talking now, though. 

There’s plenty of time to deal with hearing loss.

Hey! I had something similar when I was little. Back in the day, they didn’t do hearing tests for new borns. My parents noticed that I wasn’t forming words properly (mumbling) as I was getting older and they couldn’t figure out why. My mom has taken me to our GP MULTIPLE times telling him the  concerns she had and they pushed it aside till I was around 3-4 years old. They finally did a hearing test and I failed it. My Eustachian were not draining properly, so I had to get tubes placed in both my ears…unfortunately, this caused a TON of issues for me due to the tubes falling out. I had a lot of ear infections growing up and then I started getting migraines when I was around 8-9 years old. This turned out to be a cholesteatoma…which I had to get removed twice. I am now severe to profoundly deaf in my left ear (mixed hearing loss) because of the tumour/cyst I had. 

With all that said, I think I did pretty well with catching up! It took a bit but I caught up very quickly in school! Went to college and now have a very good job with a baby on the way. You are doing everything you can and I think you are doing a wonderful job! Please keep advocating for your son.

Short answer, no. Heck no. I am hard of hearing and have been my whole life and just got hearting aids last year at the age of 35. I had IEP from 4th grade on to help with my learning due to my hearing. You are doing great and getting things done before he even enters school. The time can be made up and it sounds like you are already doing therapies to help. You are not ruining his life.

I too have mild/mild-moderate hearing loss from birth. My parents didn’t get confirmation until I was around your child’s age, I got my first pair of hearing aids when I was 4. I did speech therapy at my school for a few years (local public school). I excelled in academics and athletics and I’m now 28 years old working in sports broadcast for a major US sport. 
The only “disappointment” I have is never learning ASL, it isn’t necessary for my case but I have anxieties about my future and if I’ll need it then. 

Each child is different, so long as you continue to fight for your kiddo, provide them ample opportunities and find what works best for his learning whether it be specialized classes or main stream, ASL, combined communication, or typical spoken language. There are options, resources and sheer resilience of kids. He’s gonna be okay, and you? You’re doing great!

I don’t think you should blame your self for bealiving  doctors 🥼 , now you’r addressing the issue more and trying to find more answer so never too late ..
Napoleon hill wrote a book “think and grow rich “he was talking about a lot of other stuff and also about him having a deaf child and the struggle, and also a successful story  of his child and him never giving up on him .. take care

Aww don’t worry, you’re just navigating the best you know how, that all you can do. I was born hard of hearing and my parents knew pretty soon but didn’t really do much about it due to other medical issues. I was send to regular schools and just got some extra support as needed. Only got hearing aids when I was ten. I NEVER blamed or resented my parents for not advocating enough. They did their best, they didn’t get proper information when they needed it. Everyone’s journey is different, just try to inform yourself as much as you can and continue to be there for your son like you have been. 

P.s. If you’re up for it, look into your national/local sign language, I learned as an adult and it is SUCH a game changer

My kid had perfect hearing until too many ear infections ruptured her drums enough to steal it. This is a kid who saw an ENT starting at 6 months old and had multiple sets of PE tubes. She also has a speech disorder that hearing loss doesn't help. 

All of this to say that even the most diligent of parents end up with a kid that the stars align, and now they have issues. It doesn't make you a bad parent or neglectful. It makes you a stronger parent. 

Now, you need to explore more ways to help your son. And dont let your school district push you around on getting services!

You’re fine. Get the kid involved in the Deaf community asap

You did your best and will continue to do so. You care a lot more than most. Your son will be fine. I’m 24 and have had hearing issues since a botched tube insert as a baby.

1fdmcyo,hardofhearing,How to Get Virtual Accommodation for On Site Positions? ,"Hi everyone! I work in tech and sadly am getting laid of 9/30. I am also HOH and have about 50% hearing, although I do have hearing aids that I use to help me. However, I only want to work in a virtual job as I believe it levels the playing field for me and prevents stress that would otherwise be caused trying to hear in a noisy office or echoey conference room. 

I have begun applying for other positions, but as many of you know, the current job market is terrible. It used to be easy to find virtual job in tech, but not anymore.

I would love to look for on site positions as well, with the caveat that I would ask for an accommodation to be remote due to my hearing. Legally, I believe I am entitled to this accommodation as well as a fair hiring process where this request is not taken into account.

Realistically, I know if I bring this up in the hiring process that I will likely not get the job. Personally I think this is discrimination.

What do you all think? How can I apply to onsite jobs while requesting this accommodation without it hurting my chances? If I mention this in the hiring process and am rejected, is there any legal recourse for me or will they just say they found a better candidate?

[댓글]
IMO, a company that is not advertising the position as remote or hybrid isn't likely to find a remote work accommodation reasonable for this reason.  And with lots of other qualified candidates, realistically it could hurt your chances to request this.  But it would also be extremely difficult to prove that it was discrimination, especially when other reasonable accommodations could have appropriately leveled the playing field for your condition.

Other accommodations for an in person position might be requesting a private office space (or sound minimizing wall dividers) to minimize noise, and perhaps either using zoom from your private office or requesting some kind of assistive tech device for meetings in the conference room.",2024-09-10 16:38:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1fdmcyo/how_to_get_virtual_accommodation_for_on_site/

What kind of information will help you in the design process, and how can you pose your questions to get at those specific answers?

1favxyj,hardofhearing,Classroom accommodation for 5 year old?,"My son was born with bilateral mod-severe HL. He wore hearing aids for a few years and then all of the sudden he didn't need them anymore.

His tympanogram shows type C and bilateral middle ear dysfunction.

He's in mainstream Kindergarten now and has no accommodations for his former hearing loss, but I'm wondering if maybe we need to make some.

He's seated towards the back of the room.

His teacher is extremely soft spoken. She uses a clip on mic to amplify her voice, but the speaker volume is low and it's muffled. I am not HOH and I had a hard time catching everything that she said during orientation.

He's been off task, chatting with other students and generally not paying attention. I'm thinking a contributing factor might be that he's maybe processing the verbal instructions slower, or he's not hearing all of it and then giving up.

I included his most recent hearing test results. I'm most confused about the graph. I know it shows that he is within ""normal range"" but is it borderline?

Is that even a thing?

You said you included his most recent hearing test, but it isn’t in the post. It could definitely help us better understand what might be helpful for him, but also if he no longer has hearing loss I don’t think he would qualify for accommodations

Do you trust these results? My son had tests that showed almost normal hearing (after having mild to moderate for 2 years). We were changing offices and the new audiologist tested and it showed his typical loss. Since then its progressed even more. 

You can talk to the school. It may be possible to get some accommodations in place like preferential seating, extra check ins for understanding, visual schedules and other helpful practices.

You didn't include the audiogram, can you add it?

That’s weird. You should try to investigate a bit what the potential reasons for the differences in results might be. At least it should be followed up regularly to make sure hearing loss isn’t missed. 

“He's been off task, chatting with other students and generally not paying attention. I'm thinking a contributing factor might be that he's maybe processing the verbal instructions slower, or he's not hearing all of it and then giving up.”

I very much believe you’re right. I’d actually say that even with a mild hearing loss there could be some issues like that. There are many contributing factors to loosing focus, and I do think hearing has a big impact. In combination with a soft spoken teacher, it’s very likely you’re right.

Anyway, for like 8 years they've been fine and I've only had to replace the wax filters like maybe once every couple of months. Starting sometime this spring, the audio is completely blocked and I have to replace the wax filter about every week. It's a dramatic difference.

Is this weird? Could it be related to the age of the aids, or am I just suddenly much more waxy or something? It's still only my first set and I've been trying to make them last as long as possible.

I have an old set that's about 8 years and also a new set. Before I got the new set, my right side old one starting acting up. I sent it in to a HA repair that was recommended on this sub. Only $250 and they replaced the inner works. It works perfect now. 
    Not sure about the wax guard issue though. Sounds like something going on with your ear.

DS is 18. He has had HA’s since 3rd grade. He used to be a once a week or two filter changer. Once puberty hit hard, his wax production went into overdrive. Sometimes he was changing them more than once a day. Nuts. 
His audiologist did suggest going somewhere periodically to have his ears flushed. He’s just waxy, I guess.",2024-09-06 21:32:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1faqmwc/wax_filters/

1f9zz3z,hardofhearing,Cause of low frequency hearing loss?,"Hi! So I've just officially been diagnosed with mild low-frequency hearing loss and have a trial fitting for hearing aids in a few weeks. 

I'm 27 and this has gotten worse over the past few years with no history of noise exposure, frequent ear infections, etc., so I'm just struggling a bit wondering why this has happened and if it will get worse. My audiologist and ENT say they suspect it might be something genetic. 

I went to a vestibular therapist for testing for inner ear issues because I'm having balance issues and vertigo as well and was concerned about something like Meniere's but according to them I'm perfectly fine with my inner ear and the balance issue is likely neurological.

If any of you have this type of hearing loss, do you know the cause of yours?

[댓글]
I have mild hearing loss and all of my hearing is making its way under the normal line. Low and high frequencies are slightly worse though. I also have balance issues/vertigo and my ENT thought it was Menieres for a few years, but this year he ruled it out because my hearing loss is equal in both ears. 


Most likely my hearing loss is something genetic? It's progressive and my ENT thinks it's something on the cellular level probably because I have EDS and suspected Mitochondrial issues.  


The more I research, the more I see that people really don't know what caused their hesri g loss definitively. They have a couple of ideas but really can't pinpoint it.

I have low frequency hearing loss too! And weirdly enough ALSO have balance issues. I was diagnosed with bilateral vestibular hypofunction in March and did PTO to combat that. 

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any answers as to the cause of mine. Hearing issues do run in my family, but I don't know what kind of hearing loss my dad has or what kind my grandpa had, and my mom's hearing loss is due to her job as a band teacher. 

If you get any updates as to connections of reverse slope (low frequency) hearing loss and the balance issues, update me!

Hi! 28 and navigating moderate reverse slope loss - my hearing aid appointment is in a little over a week!

In my case, it's just one ear, and it's being chalked up to a nasty ear infection I had last year (I couldn't move my head without puking, so it was definitely inner ear).

I had an MRI (and you might be sent for one too?) to determine if it was an acoustic neuroma, but when that came back clean, they kinda shrugged and said, yeah, it was probably the ear infection.

Definitely a bit freaky to have a diagnosis by elimination, not confirmation, but I'll be going in every year to monitor the loss, so it might get revisited.",2024-09-05 22:52:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1f9zz3z/cause_of_low_frequency_hearing_loss/

1f9ddr3,hardofhearing,Character is HOH in one ear,"Hello, 

Im writing a story where the main character is hard of hearing in one ear as a result of head trauma when she was younger. I’ve done some research, but can’t find too much about people with one good ear and one ear that is moderately deaf. She wears a hearing aid, but I’m trying to figure out how to describe what things sound like when she doesn’t wear it, such as music or a rainstorm. I’ve read that the HOH ear would hear things like they were underwater, but I’m curious how that mixes with a good ear on the other side.

I was hoping someone who experiences this kind of hearing loss would be able to describe what it sounds like and how it affects them. Thank you!

[댓글]
For me, it's the direction that sound comes from that gets messed up. I'm mostly deaf in left ear, somewhat hoh in right. Without my hearing aids, I have trouble discerning where some sounds are coming from.

I have this condition, although my hearing loss is not profound. For me, it's like I'm wearing a really effective noise canceling headphone on my right ear. 

When I'm wearing my hearing aids, that's when My voice sounds strange to me. It's called occlusion, and it's kind of hard to get used to. It's sort of like the conductive part of your hearing is ramped way up. My voice sounds too loud internally and the tonality is completely different to me.

R/monohearing exists

I am profoundly deaf to high frequencies in my right ear; my left ear has normal age-related hearing loss.

I have aids with open domes, so that the lower frequencies that I can hear can reach my ears, but the higher sounds can be amplified. Even with aids, my right ear remains partly deaf.

With my aids in everything sounds normal, but if people are on my right side I can't make out what they are saying. Without my aids I can hear if people are speaking and I can tell if they are happy, sad, or angry, but I can't make out the actual words. Other sounds are much quieter too, but it just feels like everything has gone quiet.

So, the only thing of slightest interest to a story is that I keep trying to get people to sit or walk on my good side.

So this is me, more or less (some loss in both but mainly in one).


That would still make the character hard of hearing - which is an identity in its own right. You would say that he has 'unilateral hearing loss' (as opposed to 'bilateral hearing loss' - meaning both ears).


I am able to hear most sounds BUT with issues.


Quiet and soft sounds on my left can sometimes be completely lost occassionally.


Sounds on my left also sound 'muddy' or 'hazy', almost like 'blurry' but for sound. Its not quite 'muffled' but that is close. If someone speaks on my left it often sounds like gibberish, like a language I don't know. So I make sure to keep people on my right side so I can hear them.


If a sound occurs within a room I often have no clue where it is coming from. I have to look around to find out, or ask.


I wouldn't notice this during rain or music, that sounds normal to me. I often have more trouble making out lyrics than others, and perhaps miss some subtleties but beyond that music is fine. But I would tend to use mono settings on headphones because I find stereo audio disorienting - especially if there is lyrics / sounds only playing in my left. There are also accessibility features in my phone which means I can boost the sound in one ear but not the other to trh and bring it more level for me.


Rivers are a fun experience because walking up and down rivers sound completely different depending on which side of me they are on. On one side they sound deeper, and the other they sound higher.


Talking in groups is a nightmare scenario. If I keep everyone on my right (better) then that is all voices coming into my right which is hard to make out what everyone is saying individually. If people are on both my left and right then I struggle to hear those on my left. Gods help me if someone is behind me or facing away from me. I definitely use lipreading.


I didn't grow up with sign language and got on fine. School was... school... and was hard to always hear the teacher (etc) but I had a lot of other issues in school which kinda overshadowed my hearing related ones. BUT I did learn sign in my teens and am now fluent - I am aiming to take the highest qualification in BSL this year. I LOVE Deaf signing goups - I feel FREE in them. I can chat and understand everyone, which is a gamechanger for me - I also went off to study Deaf Studies in uni. I would strongly reccomend all deaf and hard of hearing folks give it a try, yes even if you have only mild hearing loss.

For me, it's not a sound at all. I can sometimes physically hear the words, but understanding them is another ballgame. My speech recognition gets worse as my hearing does.

I have this- hearing loss in one ear and one hearing aid. As for music, it sounds different without the HA in that I’m missing some of the highs and mids, so the sound isn’t as full. I’d almost describe it as flat and dull compared to when I’m wearing my HA. Some songs almost sound totally different when I listen to them with my HA vs without. Conversations with others and the TV are much harder to hear without the HA too. 

I suppose describing it as underwater is an apt description.

Edit: I forget to mention that sometimes when I’m not using my HA, sounds can seem like they’re coming from a different location than they really are. In other words, a sound on TV might seem to me like it’s coming from inside another room to my right in my home (not because of surround sound, it’s more extreme and doesn’t happen this way for others watching with me).

I have severe hearing loss, and my right ear is my worst one. The most common thing I do is have people speak on my left side, as that’s the side I hear them the best on. If they’re whispering into my right ear I’ll literally just tell them that I can’t hear in that ear and then have them repeat themselves in my left ear

Me me me me! That's me! Dm me id be more than glad to share stuff :)

That would be me, perfect hearing in my right ear, moderate to severe loss in my left, and I have a hearing aid. I have reverse slope hearing loss, so lower frequencies are the struggle for me. 

Honestly the main thing I notice is lack of sound location, so being able to figure out where sounds are coming from. And if someone approaches me out of eyesight from the left, I won’t hear them and get spooked when they basically “teleport” right next to me, lol. 

Even with my hearing aid, it’s not like it’s 100% fixed. It helps, a lot, but it’s the kind of help where like, if I’m not at a social gathering or going outside of the house, I don’t wear it. It’s not worth the sensation of a thing being in your ear all day unless I really get something out of it, like being able to hear people talk better at a gathering. And it doesn’t sound natural, either. It sounds like something is being put through a tiny speaker in your ear (duh), it doesn’t sound like what your good ear hears. Since I have the benefit of a good ear, I can get through daily life just fine without the hearing aid. I didn’t even discover I had this hearing loss until last year - and it’s not that it was new, I just thought it was normal for everyone to have a “good” ear and a “bad” ear. 🫠

As for the underwater thing, that’s not my personal experience, but, that doesn’t mean it isn’t someone’s experience. For me it’s not like the hearing ability feels muffled or anything, it’s just… not there. Certain sounds just, don’t come through, it’s silent. Whatever I can hear does come through, but it’s much quieter. I hope this helps out.

I am mostly dead in only my left ear! I woke up one day and had zero hearing only in my left, it affected my balance tremendously and I experienced intense vertigo. Overtime, I regained some of my hearing, and I do wear a hearing aid, but I relate to your character. I also have tinnitus in my left ear, which is what is most noticeable to me when I’m not wearing my hearing aid. I also notice when I have earbuds in and I’m listening to music. In crowds, or if there is background noise, I struggle to hear people even if they’re right next to me. I guess at times things sound “underwater”, however I might describe it more as muffled for me. It’s frustrating because even though I have a good ear, it definitely affects my hearing when there’s background noise. 
I really appreciate you writing a character I can relate to into existence!!!!

I'm unsure how to describe it since I've been extremely HOH on my right ear since kindergarten (which was quite a while ago!), but what's a big problem for me is identifying the directions of sound. Someone talking to my right sounds like it's coming from behind me, for example. Sounds coming from my right are generally somewhat distorted, whereas sounds from the left are clearer.

Something I haven't seen mentioned, and how I realized I needed to get to an ENT - when I lay on my side, it's a completely different experience whether my good ear or bad ear is pointing up. My boyfriend was snoring in bed the other night, and I rolled over (putting good ear on pillow). Boom. Silence.

Good question. It’s complex, and I think you should ask a certified Teacher of the Deaf to help you. 

* Problem: How do children learn social interaction and how to communicate about things? Hearing children listen to insults and friends conversations and watch how they do. For example they can listen to dad solving an argument with their brother, and learn from that how it’s possible to solve arguments. Deaf children in Deaf families learn social interaction the same way, but the watch how the adults and other children sign. What happens if the child cannot overhear conversations and parents do sign? Then the child doesn’t have enough examples of how you talk to or sign to other people. They maybe sign or speak, but they don’t understand all the details.

* Solution? It’s difficult and depends on the age, context and situation. At the beginning, maybe the teacher helps and stars the conversation and participates in the conversation. Later, maybe the teacher helps the children to see they both like chess or football, and shows them that’s a thing they can do together, and later talk about together. For older children, they maybe understand much but just do some things wrong when communicating. Then the teacher needs to see what’s wrong, and help the students understand.


I think it’s in general important to create good relationships with the students, and a positive atmosphere. Students need to understand they should be nice to each other, patient and sometimes do things together.


It’s also important to know if there are other problem, and not just deafness. Autism, for example, can create huge communication problems socially. That needs to be handled differently.",2024-09-04 23:37:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1f983m7/how_do_i_support_my_students/

We shouldn't really be proving medical advice and it's hard to tell without other clinical assessment, but I think you should seek the opinion of an ENT doctor.

If it were me, I'd schedule an appointment with a doctor. Hope you feel better soon!

Relief/treatment requires a diagnosis, and for that you should go to a doctor, preferably an ENT. It really could be any number of things.

You could have an infection or just excess wax.  If you wear hearing aides you may be more prone to infections or wax plugs (because wax can’t get out naturally on its own).  Although an ENT is preferred a general practitioner can probably handle this.

I haven't had the surgery.  But I was born with ETD on my left side. My ENT said I was born with the bones meeting.  I now have ETD on my right side, too.  My ENT specialist used the word ""never"" to allow anyone to do surgery on my left side as the pain would be excruciating.  I don't have a normal size eustachian tube, so a balloon isn't going to make the space between 2 bones wider.  I have been unable to do the valsalva on the left since I was a child and am now middle age.

On my right side, the eustachian tube is swelling shut due to allergies. I can sometimes do a valsalva successfully.  I try to do it as often as I am able.  Prednisone used to treat a sinus infection did help temporarily.  I would guess my right side would be a good candidate for balloon therapy.

So, here are my thoughts....Be careful before you insist on a surgery that it is actually appropriate.  Why do you have ETD?  What is the cause? Is there a physical problem?  If the cause is allergies or something similar, how long before the tube swells shut again? 

You should have regular follow-up to keep the ear healthy.

Im super late but have you asked your ENT if eardrum replacement would be helpful? That and Eustachian tube dilation in one go….if you have good insurance…would be crazy to deny at this point. 

Dilation at this point is over a decade old, you should ask your ENT to refer you to a surgeon who specializes in it / other ear surgery.

it's acid reflux (lpr)

I have a similar background of ear history. I have had tubes in and out my whole life and still have not the best hearing and it affects my daily life. I got the balloon dilation and it brought me back to my normal level of hearing and life again but nothing better than I’ve ever been. After months they always get clogged with hard wax, or ear infections, trapped water or something else. The “tubes are in place and looking good but clogged with hard wax that can’t be physically removed” my ent said and did a hearing and pressure test- good pressure and lowest hearing in a while but not “hearing air level” but it doe affect me a lot. I’m considering just getting a hearing aid and saying fuck it to all of this tube maintenance but unsure if that’s the best choice either.",2024-09-04 14:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1f8u4qx/chronic_eustachian_tube_dysfunction_and_tube/
1f8tmp8,hardofhearing,Anyone here who is 20 and has hearing loss?,I guess I need comforting knowing I’m not alone. One way to cope with my ptsd was loud music in my headphones and I know I’ve done damage over the years. I’m planning to get an hearing assessment soon but it’s hard to come to terms with it. ,2024-09-04 13:41:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1f8tmp8/anyone_here_who_is_20_and_has_hearing_loss/
