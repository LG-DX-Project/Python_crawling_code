1oy15nu,hardofhearing,Anyone else get extra bothered by loud noises?,"I became HOH around 2-3 months ago and one of the things I noticed is that loud sounds irritate me a lot more. I hate loud music, loud clattering, anything loud. Went to the club for Halloween and regretted it heavily lol. Ironically, when my parents speak loud to me to get me to hear it irritates me heavily... I find myself using the noise suppression on my hearing aids quite often.

Anyone else relate to this? Why could this be?

[댓글]
yeeeup. i’ve been losing my hearing steadily ever since I spent years in marching band, shit was way too loud for my teenybopper ears. 😭 I have to wear earplugs at work when I do dishes because the plates clattering feel like scissors in my ear canals.

Lost my hearing when I was 3 and I’m now 35. A club has always sucked. I can read lips but it’s *so annoying* to hear nothing over the music.

i think with noise induced hearing loss its entirely possible your injury can cause pain with loud sounds, and thsoe with hearing loss lose the sound buffers we have. all of the hairs in my cochlea that both booths quiet sounds and dampen the louder ones are gone. my acoustic reflexes are also gone, which is what protects a healthy ear from loud sounds

I definitely am. I'm reasonably certain it's because I'm autistic. I wore hearing aids age 12-18, and when no one could make me wear them anymore, I stopped. I just picked up my new ones yesterday (age 31) and remembered immediately why I stopped. Even with the upper volume threshold lowered (the hearing aid techs can do this btw!) I was overstimulated to the point of a full meltdown within four hours. 

The thing I kept thinking the whole time was ""damn, why does *everything* need to make sound? Why can't some things just be silent?"" Frankly, if it wasn't for the benefits to communication and brain health, I wouldn't have gotten new hearing aids at all. My hearing loss is a blessing in the face of my auditory avoidance.

Yep, auditory sensitivity is awful. Though I can't say if it's due to my hearing loss or not, since I've had it since birth and I have other sensory sensitivities. In my case it's likely a sensory processing issue, but being HoH does also mean you get used to a bit more peace and quiet. It also means it's harder to hear people talking over background noise, so this could be your issue as well.",2025-11-15 19:52:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oy15nu/anyone_else_get_extra_bothered_by_loud_noises/
1oxx86o,hardofhearing,Ear Distortion Got Better but Not Gone What Could This Be?,"I’m 15 and last week I suddenly started getting this weird *robotic/buzzy distortion* in my **left ear** whenever I heard sounds. It lasted about 2–3 days and then mostly went away, but my hearing still isn’t completely normal.

Here’s what’s still happening:

* Sounds in my left ear still feel **slightly low-pitched**, especially noticeable in things like my OnePlus Buds Pro boot-up sound
* Occasionally the robotic distortion comes back for a some time
* I have a mild cold, and now I also notice a very faint **“fluid moving” sound** in my **right ear**, but only when I really focus
* My right ear otherwise seems fine
* No injury, nothing loud happened that day, it was a normal day
* I use earbuds regularly but never had this issue before

Last week’s robotic sound scared me a bit, even though it went away. I’m just wondering if this is something like fluid/pressure from my cold and if it can fix itself, or if I should see a doctor/ENT. =

Has anyone had something similar? Should I be concerned that some symptoms are still hanging around?

Yes generally if  you’re having a health issue you should see a health care provider. That being said  if you have a cold it may be worth waiting for that to subside and then assessing if you need to see a dr. Having a cold impacts the ears nose and throat so it’s possible that’s the issue",2025-11-15 17:16:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxx86o/ear_distortion_got_better_but_not_gone_what_could/

Forget your HAs from your bluetooth settings and set them up again as a new set. That usually fixes it.

Also, make sure you're not paired to too many things. I had issues when paired to my computer, ipad, iphone, etc. and had to turn off bluetooth on one of them to get it to connect to my phone.

It is totally wrong to think you are worthless just because of a hearing problem. How old are you? When I was in middle school, I lacked confidence because I wore hearing aids, and my life was a mess. Even in China, where long hair is not allowed for boys in school , I grew my hair long to cover them up. I tried my best to avoid socializing because I thought people would laugh at my hearing aids. Instead of worrying about your irreversible hearing issue, try to improve the things you can change. From my experience, most people don’t actually care about your hearing aids. Sure, they might talk about them occasionally, but most of the time, they’re just being kind and want to understand your situation. If someone laugh at you, just ignore them, or like me punched them. I have been watching a lot of posts from reddit and other platforms to seek for other experience. Only conclusion I can find is be confident. Confidence changed my high school life. If you still struggle to make new friends, I can tell you that social skills are *really* important.  
All I want to say is you have a lot of things to improve on,don’t struggle with something you can’t change.

I'm so sorry you’re feeling sad, worthless, and hopeless. You’re not alone in experiencing those feelings, and many people feel this way at some point in their lives. I’ve personally felt that way. The good news is that feelings are transient, and help is available for times when we feel stuck in unpleasant emotions or situations. 

Have you spoken to your doctor or to a therapist? I’m neither a doctor nor a therapist, but it sounds as if you may be experiencing [depression or major depressive disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007). If so, the PHQ-9 is a [simple diagnostic tool](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1725/phq9-patient-health-questionnaire9) that can provide you with a sense of your level of depression.

The Lifeline has [options for deaf and hard of hearing individuals](https://988lifeline.org/deaf-hard-of-hearing-hearing-loss/). Depression hurts, but there’s treatment available to ease the pain. 

Your first step is to make an appointment with your primary care physician for a physical to make sure you’re healthy and that there are no underlying causes for your depression. Your doctor may be able to recommend a therapist in your area, and s/he may also recommend pharmaceutical treatment(s) for depression. Sometimes the brain needs extra help in getting out of a mental or emotional rut. Next schedule an appointment with a therapist. If you can’t find a therapist in your area, [DeafLead](https://deaflead.org/services/mental-health-services/) may be able to help. 

Please know that you matter and that you’re infinitely valuable. You’re also a stronger person than you know. Nature has given you all the resources you need to survive and thrive. You will feel better with time and treatment. Please don’t give up. Happiness is not beyond your reach.

Hearing aids do more to improve my quality of life than any other health remedy or appliance! No clueless smiling-and-nodding. No failure to engage for fear of misunderstanding or social faux pas. Renewed satisfaction in being a real-time interactive part of family gatherings and intimate moments.

Yes. HAs helped me reenter life!

No. That's never happened. Hearing aids *always* pick up unwanted background noise.

Every family gathering last year had me basically saying nothing and not really interacting a lot, because of all the extra noise making it virtually impossible for me to actually meaningfully participate in the social aspect of these events.

Anytime I'm anywhere and someone wants to socialize with me, it never seems to be quiet enough. A refrigerator can be too distracting. I go to the bar, the store, the coffee shop, or the bank (of all places) and some idiot just *has* to have the radio on.

If anything, even after 30 years of wearing hearing aids (I'm 37), I long for the quiet solitude of just being able to watch Netflix (which has CC) or YouTube (usually with a Bluetooth headset).

Hearing aides don't work for me, but with learning ASL and visiting Deaf spaces I've had a similar experience. I'm enjoying the company of other people for the first time and having a blast!

i would say yes, mostly. i love my phonaks. the settings do well to tune out background noise in social settings. i also get to enjoy music again which is a huge part of my life and something that connects my circle of friends. i’ve done a lot less smile and nodding.

You’re lucky, my hearing is too poor for that.

I would love to know from OP and the other people who say their hearing aids have helped, which hearing aids they have? Because mine are useless with background noise but I've got basic ones and I'm hoping to save up and get something a bit fancier.

We all have our issues with HA. A lot depends on the degree of loss we have and including tinnitus. My hearing loss is severe and HA (Phonak) have literally saved me from severe depression. I’m unable to hear music, but I have been able to get by in every day living. Background noise is our biggest nemesis, and the industry has made some headway with AI chips.

Pretty much everything! Conversations that would get skipped due to fear of non-hearing started happening, brought a lot of extroversion too.

No, not really I think. Although I’m much more responsive instead of saying “what?” or “huh?” all the time or not even responding at all

No, I can just hear better

Well, I can interact better with others, so in a way, yes. But not completely, because I was born hard of hearing and I'm very much in my own world.

I wish. I really miss being social. HAs don’t help me in group settings. Most of my interactions are online, and limited at that. 😞

I suggest on here that everyone state severity of their loss and what type of audiogram/loss- high/low/cookie bite (“U” audiogram)/ reverse cookie bite (upside down U) when comparing experiences.  HA success in social situations depends a lot on these factors as well as the technology.  
I have reverse cookie bite, 70-80 dB on low and high end and sensorineural loss. Started with Phonak Audeo and now Resound Linq9, I think. Nothing has helped me in noisy situations or those where multiple people talk at the same time.  I suffer through restaurants but rarely can hear everyone. I wish more restaurants would invest in sound dampening panels or have some tables away from music speakers. Sigh.

Before I got my hearing aids, I definitely avoided a lot of social situations. I’d often just stay quiet in group conversations or skip noisy events because I was worried I’d mishear or say something wrong. It was mentally exhausting trying to keep up.
After I got my Nova hearing aids from Heardirectclub, it’s like a weight lifted. I can follow conversations much more easily, even in noisy places, and I actually enjoy joining in again. I feel more confident speaking up and just being present without constantly second-guessing myself. Honestly, it’s made me way more social than I’ve been in years.",2025-11-15 05:04:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxj2qv/did_getting_hearing_aids_change_how_social_you_are/

I've owned a couple of sets with BT and never had this problem.  If it happens with different media on different devices like tv and computer, maybe it's using an older version of Bluetooth, or maybe it's using the latest Bluetooth but the processor can't quite handle it properly?

I’ve struggled with this for most of my life, for some background info, I’m a woman and almost 40 and have a hearing loss. I am well educated and hold a job and own my own home. 

I find it hard to make friends that take me seriously or don’t seem to comprehend that I have understanding of human depth and conversations. I am socially awkward due to my hearing loss and have missed a lot on social cues growing up. I have some friends and good ones but the ones I am unsure about, they seem to be surface level friends- not meeting me halfway or understanding me or making an effort. (Don’t get me wrong, with my hearing devices I hear perfectly clear and communicate just fine) but they seem more surface level and just meh. I feel like sometimes I’m a filler friend like an option if no one else is around. Are these people just fake acquaintances? I have a hard time reading social cues as well.

I am currently in therapy figuring out my shit- working on being healthier and making healthier choices and learning my own self worth. But it only seems to solve my problems as it is on my own, but hasn’t seemed to improve my social life. Does anyone have any tips to just let this go and focus on oneself?

Sorry if this all sounds like a midlife crisis- but I’m so tired. 😪

If anyone has any motivating advice or inspiration, please send them my way. 🤟🏼

I'm 57. I've been wearing aids since I was 23. For the longest time I had only hearing friends, which is good. Some understand better than others, that's for sure. When my hearing dropped the last time, two hearing friends didn't fully understand my new communication issues and I had to let it all go and that was hard. I don't know if you have any local hearing loss support groups but that's helped me in the end. They validate my experiences. 

I've been talking about confidence and self-esteem the last week or so on other social media. If you're on LinkedIn, my posts is open to anyone (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelle-wyatt-a410b7233/). It is hard to have confidence with hearing loss, doubting whether or not we heard right or not. Plus people have so many misconceptions about hearing loss. That's the part I'm always correcting.

Hi. 

You took a page from my diary, typed it and called it your own! 🤭🙃🥰🫣 

You are far from alone.

If you’d like to talk/txt/be pen pals, please reach out. I’ve found that the more I talk with those who have walked the path similar to mine, the more we understand each other. I went through my entire life thinking I was broken; I didn’t know anyone else like me. I was living in a very small town, my parents had the best intentions but they kept me isolated (severely) and I never got the chance to go out into the real world until I was in my 30’s. It was…SHOCKING. 

It still is. 

I’m now 44. I have went from hearing aides to a Cochlear Implant, which was the best thing I have ever done in my life. I have been a Cochlear mentor for about 3 years; I went from being the person who viewed my hearing loss as my deepest darkest secret. I hid it at all costs; it was the shame that undid me. Now? I’m proud of my path. I’m one of the, if not the biggest advocates for @CochlearAmerica 
I tell everyone the truth about life with hearing loss, deadness, and how it affects not only you but everyone else around you. Hearing loss is a one way street, fast track to early onset of dementia. Cochlear gave me a chance to learn how to live AGAIN. This time? I hear so much that I have never heard before. 
Fortunately/Unfortunately. 
Ha!

1ox2x78,hardofhearing,How often do you end up charging your hearing aids during,"I’ve been thinking about upgrading soon, but I’m curious how people handle charging routines. I know most newer models are rechargeable now, but do they realistically last a full day with normal use, especially if you stream music or take calls through Bluetooth? Please let me know how your experience has been with rechargeable hearing aids.

[댓글]
battery life for mine (phonak) is the whole day, 9am-10pm give or take and i only charge them when i’m sleeping. on the plus side, if you forget to charge them overnight i find that charging them just for 20-30 minutes gets me through 5-6 hours. I’m constantly listening to music through them, and find it doesn’t affect the battery life. my last hearing aids (first of rechargeable/bluetooth model) lasted me a little more than 4 years until battery was basically gone

Yes, they absolutely last a full day. I've had mine for two years and they last for 14-16hrs even with heavy (like, 8-10 hours) of streaming. 

I've only had them die before I could put them in their charging case maybe... three or four times over the past two years? It's been great. 

But yeah... without streaming, I imagine they'd probably last two full days. They're absolutely not like iphones.

I work 12 hours shifts for work. I use batteries now but back when I had rechargeable I’d throw them in at 5am, and by 7-8pm they would be dying. So for me, did not last a full day. As a guy in his 30’s doing shift work I did not like the rechargeables and switched back to battery.

I've had Resound Quattros for at least 6 years now. I only recharge them at night. They're usually still at 75% battery when I put them on the charger.


I do maybe an hour total of streaming/calls each day.

Most HAs now will last for 30-50ish hours. I wear my Phonak sphere 90s from about 7am to midnight every day and they're usually at 60-70% battery still when I go to charge them. I stream a ton and use the sphere mode a ton. 

I had Oticon More 1s before those and I would typically get about 1.5 days of use out of them before needing to charge. It's a non-issue these days.

Only one time in three years have I ever had a low battery warning from my hearing aids. I must have been streaming very heavily that day.

Mine are 3 years old and still holding a full day charge. I *did* completely forget that I would need to charge them while we were flying overnight from the US to Iceland, so after landing, I had to charge them in the terminal while we waited for our shuttle.

I charge my Jabras every night

Mine can last several days without a charge. I try to charge it every other day if not every day

My last hearing aids were Kirkland brand and they were the first generation of rechargeable. The battery sucked. I have long days (6-11) and they would start to die between 3-6 pm depending on how much Bluetooth I used (usually a lot). 

My new hearing aids are ReSound. The battery is amazing. I can stream all day and they have tons of power left at night. Also the charging dock holds battery so if you can't plug into an outlet you can just set them in the case and they'll recharge quickly. However, their water resistance sucks (I had to get them fixed by the manufacturer after only 3 months due to a sweaty workout) and I've had a lot of issues with the Bluetooth. My next set will be Phonak and I'm never getting anything other than that.

Oticon Intent. On workdays I take them out of the charger at around 7 am, listen to music and podcasts, make calls all day. At 10 pm they are still at around 30 % charge. 

Age is about 1 year.

My Widex Moments last a full day, unless it's a heavy Bluetooth usage day.  I put them in the charger when I go to sleep around 10-ish and take them out of the charger when I wake up at 5....

I had to upgrade to a stronger hearing aid so now have battery powered but my old was a rechargeable phonak and lasted me one day easily. Sometimes two days since I never used the music or calls (couldn’t hear them clearly enough).

I have oticon HAs and wear them an average of 3/4 hours a day (I have sensory problems, and wearing them for a long time is too much). I usually only charge them once a week. To be fair, I do have a charging case and I just put them back in there each time instead of putting them in the regular case, so they're always at 100% each use, and the case holds about 3 full charges. They definitely last longer than my battery HAs did.

I've got Phonak rechargeables for a mild to profound bilateral loss, put them in around 7-8 am and they last me until 9/10 pm. use them for Bluetooth pretty consistently throughout the day (laptop, phone calls, music, etc). but I normally take them out by 4pm cuz I'm done hearing lol

Mine, Oticon Intent 4, last about 20 hours.

I charge mine at night and the charge lasts for the whole day. Every once in a while they disconnect from charging and I have to charge them. Rare tho

I have \~5 year old Resound Quattros and they still last 18-20 hours/day.

I stream a lot. My Phonak hearing aid is good for 7 hours of continuous streaming.

My phonaks usually run out of batteries around 21-22 in the evening.  Which is usually OK as I'm winding down but very impractical with a social life.
Ideally I would allow them 30 minutes of charging in the afternoon on those days.

If I use them for audio a lot they run out an hour to three earlier. 
I usually charge them at night and out them in just before leaving the house in the morning (around 7).

I get a full day, 7a–10.30p listening to music almost the whole time. The amount of amplification does make a difference—my right ear is much deafer than my left ear and I can see the difference in battery level easily, but just checking right now, it’s 5p and I have over 75% battery in both HAs (although they’re also relatively new since I just replaced them last month).

I’ve been using Heardirectclub Nova rechargeable hearing aids for about a year. Usually, they last all day with normal use. I only charge them overnight. If I’m streaming a lot, I might top them up at lunch, but overall it’s way easier than swapping batteries.",2025-11-14 17:32:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ox2x78/how_often_do_you_end_up_charging_your_hearing/

1ow97e7,hardofhearing,Hearing parent with HOH child,"Hello all!

I am a mom of a newly diagnosed child (2F) with moderate hearing loss. She has a genetic condition called Marshalls Syndrome, that causes progressive hearing loss. We are working on getting hearing aids ordered and have seen all the medical professionals  (Audiology, ENT, etc).

We are already plugged in with TEIS (TN early intervention) and have seen a Social worker. My husband and I both work full time and She goes to daycare full time. 

  
Mainly I am posting because I have no idea what I am doing.  No one in my or my husbands family have gone through this process and we feel so alone. People in our circle are supportive, but they just don't understand as most of our friends don't even have kids, let alone one with a disability. 

  
Any insight would be helpful. Also, any recommendation for support groups or assistance would be appreciated as well. We are just lost and need guidance. &lt;3

[댓글]
Connecting with early intervention is a good thing. Encourage ASL and spoken english equally. Check out r/podc.

*hugs* 

You could see if there is an active hands &amp; voices program near you. 

Gallaudet has extension offices, not sure if there is one in TN, but if there is contact them. Shared Saturday Reading is an amazing experience. 

StartASL has ASL1 for free online.

I know it would be a big trip and investment if it were a good fit for your child, but our experience doing cochlear implants at Boston Children's was outstanding. We hesitated going through with it, and now that it's done we wish we had done it much earlier. 

I also recommend looking up wrights Law and getting their books. They are THE go to lawyers and advocates for special education. If they ever do an in person training near you I highly recommend it.

I'm HoH myself (100% deaf in left ear, severe-profound in right ear).

Depending on where you are, there may regularly held social events for Deaf/HoH people. Those can go a very long way to not only help you and your husband, but especially your daughter so she sees others just like her. It's likely to be at a place similar to, say, BW-3's (that's where I used to go to one all the time where I live). It's also a fantastic way to learn sign language and getting help because all of you will be totally immersed in that environment. It might be overwhelming at first, but I promise everyone there will be so eager to help!

HOH child here! Definitely do both English and sign language. Join deaf communities. You are not alone in this. There’s a lot more of us out there than you think and a lot of support!

Two of my sister's kids have genetic hearing loss so she's a few years ahead of you. 


My suggestions:


1. Reach out to your local nonprofit(s) for Deaf and HoH people and ask them to connect you with resources. Often there are more resources available  than most people are aware of. 
2. Start her learning accessible tech, languages, and devices before she needs them. For my nephew, it was a lot easier for him to adjust  to a hearing assist device in school because he wasn't having to figure it out and try to follow  along in class at the same time. 
3. Read up about  disability protection in your jurisdiction.  IME, as a child who had chronic medical disabilities growing up, if you don't know your/your kid's rights, you/your kid *will* get screwed over by folks who don't  care about  your rights (I could go into detail about my numerous near misses as a kid with brittle asthma, but I'll spare you. Suffice to say I know from experience that if you're not looking out for her, nobody is).

As a hearing Mom who raised two HOH kids, I wanted to chime in.  First of all, lots of good resources suggested. Just be proactive in your area and keep asking questions to get plugged in to what's available.

  
The path we took involved having our kids aided during all waking hours (except showers and swimming pools). I know it's hard when they're little, just do your best. My kids had hearing aids fitted when they were infants. Our goal was to have it feel weird to them when they aren't wearing the hearing aids since that is so crucial to development. 

  
And then talk, talk, talk. When I ran out of material I turned to books. We read books everywhere. On the floor, in the tub, in the car, on the sofa, in bed. The books became friends, but were really a gateway to language. Language acquisition came differently for my hoh kids than my hearing kids. They didn't absorb it like sponges. They needed more explanation, more interaction. 

  
It takes a lot of intention. But it does not have to be limiting. My two kids now: lawyer and medical laboratory scientist in their mid-20's.

Hi! I'm also the hearing parent of a HOH child. I recommend getting connected with the Deaf community, such as through a school for the deaf. Sign up for a Deaf mentor if you can. I have found it so valuable to learn from DHH adults since my child (16 months) cannot yet tell me about his experience. Connecting with other families of DHH kids can also be helpful, though to be honest, I've had some mixed experiences with other hearing parents having ableist views about our kids. But we do still attend playgroups and events for DHH kids because it's important to me that my kids see and get to know other DHH kids. I don't want my son to feel like he's the only one.

I also recommend learning ASL! Real time in person or virtual classes are ideal, but I know that can be challenging as the parent of young children. I have mostly been using the app Lingvano alongside the ASL at Home curriculum (https://www.aslathome.org/) and this book by Cecilia Grugan: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/714348/learn-to-sign-with-your-baby-by-cecilia-s-grugan-illustrated-by-brittany-castle/. ASL at Home is free to families with DHH kids. The latter two are both helpful for the kinds of vocabulary you need with young kids that might not come up as soon in ASL classes designed for adults. The site Lifeprint also has good resources, and the Oklahoma School for the Deaf offers free online classes every semester. We've also learned from our Deaf mentor. Learn ASL from Deaf people!

My son was diagnosed at 7 weeks and has had hearing aids for a little over a year now. I know it can feel like a lot to process at first, but truly, it's now just a normal part of our lives. You've got this!

Hi friend, I know things are stressful right now, and it feels like you're in uncharted waters. You've probably never met a Deaf person before. The good news is that this feels like unfamiliar ground but it's not. We've got the maps and now, we can help you find them too. Welcome to the Deaf/HoH community; we're happy you're here. 

Now, into the helpful stuff.

 [This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nIl25bnKeQl0OXkMZoq9PkW-vC6VFAqlMgBVK4-EsxM/edit?usp=sharing) is a free Google doc full of resources, and most of the research and statistics from my college career. There are statistics on Deaf people, sign language, advice to learn ASL, Deaf cultural media and documentaries, and advice to practice and teach language, reading skills, and some other stuff besides. It's a lot of what you'll need up through age 7 or so and hopefully, you find it helpful.

1ovta1y,hardofhearing,People look at me differently when I tell them I’m hard of hearing,"Hi all I’m 34, male. I take care of myself, I’m independent, I’ve built my life from scratch. But every damn time I try to talk to someone new a potential partner, someone I could genuinely connect with the moment I mention that I’m hard of hearing, everything changes.

It’s like a switch flips. The tone shifts, the replies get colder, and not long after… they vanish. I’m not angry about rejection that’s part of life but the reaction stings. It’s as if being hard of hearing suddenly makes me unworthy of basic respect or interest.

I’m not looking for pity or attention. I work, I live alone, I handle my life just fine. I just can’t hear as well as you do. That’s all. But people act like it’s some tragedy. The looks of pity, the “oh that’s sad” comments they drive me insane.

I’m honestly fed up. I’m not broken, I’m not less of a man. I just wish people saw the person first, not the hearing loss.

Anyone else who’s gone through something like this how do you keep your head straight when people keep treating you like you’re damaged goods?

[댓글]
Kinda trying to put a positive spin on this, in that they may be trying to make accommodations for you for when they talk to you?

For years ive said im hard of hearing which people dont really understand the implications, but now say partially deaf, which has better impact. Most people who know me, know to face me now, but that's taken years to ""teach"" them. Some dont bother and that's showing me the person they are, so I dont bother with them. Since partially deafness/hoh is more common, there is more awareness. 

However, there is one new meet, who will be chatting to others, I say hello and immediately she'll switch into exaggerated mouth movements and gestures. Almost talking to me like im stupid. But I take no offence. That's her ignorance and uneducated. I just smile and internally think im deaf, not stupid, go away and learn.

I’m sorry this happened to you. Those types of people aren’t worth your time. I gave up on dating because of my hearing loss, but have made many great friends who try to accommodate and are considerate of my hearing loss without making it a big deal or treating me as different. I hope you’re able to find people who don’t treat you like you’re damaged goods!

All. The. Time.

I just roll my eyes and ignore them and forget I ever crossed paths with them, honestly. I'm aware for some that's easier said than done, but a way to approach it is this: at the end of the day, does it matter in the grand scheme? Will you be thinking about this on your death bed many years from now?

There'll always be people like that, and there's not a lot we can do about that except control our own interactions with them. You could just walk away if it's bad enough.

As for the dating scene, if you're doing online dating, I find it helps tremendously to lay everything out on your profile. That's what I did and I eventually met my wife. I had nothing to hide or reveal on our first date, she knew up front what she was dealing with. That helps remove the anxiety on your part and, in a way, weeds out the potential mates you wouldn't want to be with anyway. Yeah, you might not get as many responses, but the few you do get? THOSE are the ones you want to be talking to. Especially the ones who contact you first!

Although I am also HoH, this rarely happens to me, people are actually willing to communicate. Also, your attitude towards life is positive enough so reactions people give to your disability hold no value. Sometimes we tend to lack confidence for this reason but then God chose us because we are strong enough to deal with it everyday. About the potential partner, not everyone is willing to communicate and stay for life given the challenges. I would say, look as much, go out and socialize through various activities, you'll definitely find the one.

Hello everyone I'm hearing of hard I'm not deaf .  
I just be alone everydays . It hurting too much I'm very hard to tell the communication.. that why  my friends is ignore me but I don't know yet what happened to me...
I'm hearing lost and my mind lost though 💔💔😭😭

I usually just mention it casually after we’ve been chatting for a while if it’s online. Usually before we plan to meet, and I just say it as a “btw you have speak clearly and directly at me because I have had bad hearing since I was young” type of thing vs hitting them with a medical condition right out the gate. If they are the right type of person they will want to know more as you get to know each other better.

I'm 35! I was in the same boat for a while.

Dating just reaaaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyy sucked as a gay dude. It's all so shallow now.  I ended up just putting everything front and center, and let people filter themselves out the door.

Dating feels so transactional and empty with the swiping - I had to mentally bolster myself, and just told myself that they are doing me a favor! You wouldn't want to be in a deep relationship with any of those people and then they suddenly reveal their shallow side and flake off on you when things are serious or you need them.

Someone who cares about you and is interested, will never be bothered at all, never be bothered by repeating what they say or learning new ways to communicate- And will be excited to be with you!

I just recently married after almost 5 years together!

There are good people out there, don't give up, but don't lower your standards for crappy people.

I went through the same thing. Lost my hearing in my early 30s and dating was a bit rough. I just stopped bringing it up or if people noticed, I just continued on as if everything was normal, because it was. 

If you're running into people that judge you at 34.... fuck em. I can't think of a single functioning adult that is worth their salt who would judge someone for a disability. Just do your thing man, there are plenty of women out there who don't give a shit and just want a nice, stable dude. It's hard enough dating in your 30s, the good ones are going to prioritize people who have their shit together over small physical things. 

I was able to land and marry a hottie as a mid/late 30s HA wearing male and I'm practically deaf, short, and pretty damn nerdy. If I could make it happen, I know for a fact that you can too! 

Biggest lesson I learned way back was that respect isn't earned, it's demanded. Meaning, if you act embarrassed of your hearing or bring it up in a way that opens the door to it, people will treat you like that. Just own it and be yourself. Confidence goes a lot further than you would think. Also, figure out where you can go on dates and hear well, wait a couple dates in for anywhere that might be a challenge.

Yes, this has been a common experience for me too. I put this info up front and center on my dating profile, I managed to phrase it in a positive way. ""It helps if you're interested in learning ASL or know some already as I'm \[deaf identity here\]."" 

The sad truth is many (most) people discriminate. The silver lining to this is being up front with the info saves me time, energy and emotional turmoil. There is no worrying about when to tell them like it's some dark secret. Anyone that connects has passed the initial discrimination filter, a promising sign.
  
I suggest focusing on making friends rather than going straight to a serious relationship. As a friend they get to know you. They see your heart and the (minor) flaws are no longer an instant disqualifier like they are when dating from the get-go. Relationships built on friendship is a great foundation as well.

Yup, I’m 35F and dealt with the same. As if it wasn’t hard enough dating with hearing loss to begin with!

I’m hard of hearing myself, granted only partially but I have a button that wear when I’m at work to tell ppl such. Some folks notice it and they speak up, or I tell them up front that I can’t hear them at first. I’ve even had some try to use sigh language which is kind of them, but I don’t even know much ASL!

I am sorry that you’ve faced such hurtles when it comes to your hearing, but I’d say it could help you figure out who is worth your time in some factors. Wishing you the best either way!

31f here and for me its kind of a joke. Like if you joke around about being deaf people are like, really? No way. And then they think its wild that im so functional even though the beep thresholds are in the 40s and 50s db 🤣😭

There seems to be a vibe that domes from saying you’re “hard of hearing” vs saying “I can’t hear very well” it’s weird but try and see if the people around you treat you differently?

I’m a 38 year old woman and I m literally in the exact same boat. I just feel like people don’t take us seriously or want to make the effort to communicate - even if we just have to ask for repetition. Yes learning ASL is great and that’s a whole community and culture but for us who are in the majority of the hearing world, it gets quite lonely.

OP, I'm very old and I've been very hard of hearing for a very, very long time and I've never, ever - not even once - experienced what you describe.

Are you telling this to people before you spend time with them?",2025-11-13 05:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ovta1y/people_look_at_me_differently_when_i_tell_them_im/

1ovgbq2,hardofhearing,Moderate Hearing Loss in One Ear - Seeking Advice for Next Steps,"Last week, after years of off-and-on tinnitus, a Meniere's diagnosis I never learned how to properly manage, and vestibular migraines, I found out I have permanent moderate hearing loss in my right ear.

My speech reception/awareness theshold is 25dB in my right ear, 10dB in my left. My word recognition was marked as 100% at 65dB for my right ear, and at 50dB for my left.

I was wondering if anyone out who has similar experience to this may have any recommendations. My ENT said a hearing aid evaluation is a reasonable next step, but she seemed to imply only some people similar to me find hearing aids preferable. 

My big question for that specifically is: Because my left ear is all good as of now, my main issue is struggling to hear people in loud environments, and differentiating someone/something I'm listening to from noise in general. Would a hearing aid help with this? Would it be worth some potential cons? And even the basics, like what even are the subjective cons for hearing aids? 

I haven't been able to find too much about those with a similar situation to mine, specifically when it comes to hearing aids, so any info would be very helpful.

I have a - diagnosed - selective hearing disorder and a slightly damped hearing on my one ear. It's already hard for me to converse with people in calm environments sometimes because I just can't hear what they say and need to ask to repeat several times. I'm imagining on conventions and especially in fursuit this would be even worse. 
I don't understand sign language very well. I know some letters and some simple phrases but that's it. There's also no real courses to take to improve this in my area.

1osmjp8,hardofhearing,Congenital deafness due to Kallmann syndrome,"I have a medical condition called Kallmann syndrome that affects puberty and fertility.

I also have two additional symptoms that are associated with having Kallmann syndrome, congenital anosmia and congenital hearing loss. 

My lack of sense of smell and poor hearing were both noticed in childhood but it took until I was 23 to be correctly diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome. The fact I had poor hearing and no sense of smell as well as not starting puberty should have led to an earlier diagnosis but that is another story. I was incorrectly labelled as a ""late bloomer"" for a long time as a teenager. 

I was once told I had 70% hearing loss in my left ear and 10% in my right ear. Senso-neural hearing loss. I believe the testing is different now. I used to have testing done through the NHS but they basically said it is not getting worse or better so they was not much point in having appointments any more. 

At school I was given a NHS (I live in the UK) hearing aid for my ""bad"" ear using a in ear mould. It worked up to a point but I did not like wearing it much and I ended up losing more than one of them.

As I got older I stopped using an aid for a while but found I had to restart about 10 years ago. The modern aids seem to suit me better and I got told that there was no point having an aid in my ""bad"" ear as no amount of volume would help, so instead I have a modern blue tooth chargeable aid (from Costco) for my good ear which suits me far better. 

I like the fact I can play podcasts from my I Phone through the hearing aid but I still wear headphones since I am so used to them and I do not have to worry about any noise leakage from the hearing aid.

They can determine what accommodations are reasonable/suitable and then instruct the office accordingly.

*  800-842-4681 (Voice) 
* 800-367-8939 (TTY)

Frankly this is absolutely appalling.

It's a one party state, you can record whatever you want if you're in the conversation. Your doctor's an idiot. This probably violates the ADA and you may want to insist on CART if you can't record (and you can) so you know wtf the doctor is saying. Auxiliary aids are exempt from HIPAA and it's your records being disclosed to you so it wouldn't apply anyway.

I'd e-mail a Hard of Hearing or Deaf or Disability group in the area to find out more.

Livetranscribe doesn't keep a record like the other person said but you're perfectly able to do so.

Not a lawyer not legal advice.

Android Live Transcribe has an option to transcribe without saving records

Is it something that they can arrange on their end?  They should be fine with a transcriber that they control, I would believe.

Ask for CART

That’s a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.

If it were me, I would tell them that you are a person with a disability and require accommodation to have equal access to care. Point out that they are violating the ADA and that they should be more concerned about that than you recording the conversation unless the care team is actively planning in advance to commit medical malpractice. Note that you are consenting to the recording so there’s no risk of you asserting a HIPPA claim. Request that they provide a suitable alternative or consent to you using your transcriber.

I got one put in when I was 12-14 years old, and I’m 26 now. 

I’m HOH with a hearing aid but it’s still there. (HOH from birth trauma and possibly the ear infections) 


I get 1-3 ear infections a year, even after the placement. I can’t clean my ear out because it’s narrow and my ear secretes extra wax, and it affects my daily life now. My ENT says the tube won’t come out on its own, and when I’m not dealing with wax impaction or chronic otitis media.. it works okay? I guess. It was supposed to help with my hearing, but seeing as I’m HOH even with the PE.. I don’t know. 


Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? Talk about? I feel like the tube shouldn’t be in there anymore but now I’m betting it’ll be a bigger issue. Is this just what I have to live with? I wonder if there’s scar tissue or something affecting the whole canal. I’m just lost on what to do, has anyone else experienced this?

I’m sure there’s some implications that would say it would make my hearing loss worse, but seeing as I’m already HOH, it’s not a big deal to me. It’s the constant internal sounds, and the fact that I can’t use my hearing aid when I’m having issues, which causes more stress on me.

Just want to say I totally relate. I don’t really have an answer other than get a second opinion if you can since this current path doesn’t seem to really be working for you. 

I was in your position many moons ago, and because of the constant drainage and/or ear infections my ENT convinced me bone-anchored hearing aids were the better option. And they are if you can’t keep your ears dry. 

So I had the first implant surgery. And apparently my insurance stiffed the surgery center. So they refused to schedule the second one. And that’s how I have one BAHA implant. 

Years later I found a different surgeon who performed a tympanoplasty on one ear, and that’s been great. Got me to the point I could wear regular hearing aids. But the other ear has a microscopic hole that still drains and sometimes bursts so it’s still a chancer. 

*All that to say* you’re right. Permanent tubes and regular hearing aids don’t play well with each other, generally. You need a plan for dry ears or for a different type of hearing aid. If you’re current provider isn’t listening to your needs, get another opinion — assuming that’s an option. 

I hope you find a good solution soon.

I have one PE tube. It was inserted this year after many, many ear infections in my right ear. I am HoH but only really the right ear. 

The persistent infections perforated my ear drum more than once and I go so many infections. I don’t know why. I could constantly hear fluid in there and felt pressure a lot. The tube has really helped all that and I worry about it coming out and going back to life without it. 

Yours could be helping more than you think? Sorry you’re having a tough time. The unknown aspects of hearing loss are hard. A lot of what ifs.

Edit. I have worn my hearing aid only once since having the tube put it.",2025-11-06 15:45:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oq2cni/pe_tubes/
1oowqp0,hardofhearing,Music with headphones.,"1 month ago i decided to buy some headphones off of ross for 30 bucks, they seemed great! i listened and listened about 75 decibels~ but then a week ago (more on my left ear) i had this popping yet aching pain in both of my ears lately i havent had them checked out yet so is this a sign of tinnitus? ear infection? you name it.

It could be an ear infection,  I've got plenty of them before getting my hearing checked.  It's best to go to the doctor and get antibiotics.  Hope you feel better soon.

75 dB is enough to damage your hearing. ""Sounds at 75 dB are generally considered safe for short periods, but prolonged exposure to noise at this level can potentially lead to hearing loss over time. It's best to limit exposure to sounds above 70 dB to protect your hearing.""",2025-11-05 07:39:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oowqp0/music_with_headphones/
1oorwu4,hardofhearing,"Missing an old childhood friend, Harris.","Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this really belongs here, but I’ve been carrying this for a while and just needed to share.

A long time ago, back around 2002–2007, we went to the same Queensdale elementary school. He’s deaf / hard of hearing and so am I too. I remember his birthday being in May. After 2007, he moved away — I was told it might’ve been to Cuba, but I never knew for sure. Now it's 2025, he would be 26 right now.

It’s been so many years now. I’ve searched in every way I can think of. I guess this post is half a vent, half a small hope that someone here might remember him.

I just want to know he’s okay, somewhere out there.

Thanks for letting me put this out there.

1ool929,hardofhearing,Struggling with Hearing Loss Working in Retail,"Not sure what I am asking, or if it’s just a rant. Does anyone have any suggestions for navigating hearing loss at work? I am currently working in retail. Some days are okay, but it’s been a struggle lately. I fear that my hearing has changed again. I am currently using a single hearing aid. I’ve not been able to get a second device yet. 

Lately, it’s been a struggle with hearing customers and particularly answering phones. It’s becoming distressing to me because I feel my performance at work has greatly diminished. Not really sure what my alternatives are and trying to make the best of it. Would really appreciate any suggestions or advice for help. Thank you!

I also work retail, and it's such a pain. I'm lucky enough to have loud colleagues and stable hearing, but still, it's insane the number of customers who mumble their orders; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble it slightly differently; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble in another different way; I ask them to speak up, and say it again; and then they yell at you; I usually pull out one of my hearing aids, show it to them, then say I'm hard of hearing, and ask if they could just repeat their order loudly and clearly; they usually do, and look kinda ashamed about yelling at me (which is the least consolation I would ask for). 

If you can get a few colleagues on side, to speak up for you (literally, not as in talk to management, although telling customers that they need to speak up is nice), you'll find it gets much easier. If you are able to take tasks from colleagues and give them the phone, that also tends to go pretty well if you plan how to do that ahead of time. 

But generally, retail is already crappy, but apparently it's more crappy if you can't hear what's going on. Finding the spare time to enjoy it is great though.",2025-11-04 22:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ool929/struggling_with_hearing_loss_working_in_retail/

1omxyxc,hardofhearing,Safety questions,"Hey everyone who are here, I have two safety questions. Easy and hard

I don’t hear the smoke detector so which brand do you use and why, like powerful strobe light. 

If my wife has a fall how would I know. The iPhone app would notify me after emergency notification. Any other ways to do this? And, she’s diabetic and would send an alert to my phone which I probably wouldn’t hear. Other than in the canal aids, any ideas? I take out mine at night.  TIA

[댓글]
If your concerns is specifically when you're asleep, I'd recommend getting a bed shaker. I got mine to alert me when the baby is crying, but you can set them up to go off with fire alarms, phone alerts, etc. Here's the brand I use: https://www.sereneinnovations.com/collections/home-alert

I have an IPhone and Apple Watch. Notifications can buzz on my wrist. It’s enough of a buzz to wake me up. Maybe look for an app that can connect to an Apple Watch. Apple Watch also has a fall detection feature. I don’t know how it connects to others, but I imagine it has some kind of alert system. 

Alternatively, look for an app that has different options for notification sounds. Something at a good frequency for you.

She can get a smart watch with fall detection. It will send an alert to your phone. If you have smart house things (like Google home and hue lights) you could program your phone to send those alerts to the lights so they blink. I don't know how to do that, but I know it's possible.

Ask your local fire department about smoke alarms. Many install ones appropriate for hearing loss.

You may want to look into getting an alert system for the deaf or hard of hearing. These systems monitor for common sounds (doorbell, kitchen appliances, fire/smoke alarm, baby cry, pet sounds) and send a notification of the sound to a receiver that alerts the deaf or hard of hearing person of the sound. Many of these alert systems also can be triggered by the push of a button transmitter. If your wife were to push the button, the alert system would notify you via whatever receiver mechanism you’ve selected (light, sound, vibration, or all three). 

[Diglo](https://www.diglo.com) (formerly Harris Communications) is a good source for alert technologies for deaf and hard of hearing consumers. 

[Sonic Alert](https://www.sonicalert.com/home-aware-signaling?page=1) has a [HomeAware system](https://www.diglo.com/sonic-alert-homeaware-ii-signaling-hub;sku=SA-HA360M-II;s=322;p=SA-HA360M-II) that listens for smoke/CO detector alerts/sirens and alerts the homeowner with flashing lights, sound, and/or vibration. 

[Silent Call](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/transmitter) also has [transmitters](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/fire-alarm-transmitter-contact-input) and [receivers](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/medallion-series-shake-up-receiver-with-vibrator-su5001mc) that can be tied into smoke/CO detectors (as well as phones, weather alerts, doorbells). 

There’s also a [Safe Awake](https://www.hearmore.com/product/safeawake-smoke-alarm-aid-with-bed-shaker?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21019171632&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADD0mp6_Y3kUzBvreN2C6OA7F6PdA&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8fbEk7jMkAMVbjRECB3-KiOMEAQYBSABEgJ71_D_BwE) monitor for smoke/CO detectors.

After researching my options for a few weeks, I just made the decision to get a [bundled alerting system](https://us.bellman.com/collections/alerting-devices) from [Bellman &amp; Symfon](https://us.bellman.com). Although the price point was higher than I would have preferred, I liked that the system is modular, easy-to-use, and has a wide range of plug and play transmitters, receivers, and accessories to choose from. This is my first alert system, and so finding something safe, simple, and scalable was important to me. 

I hope you’ll find something that meets your needs.

[EDIT: In my research I also found the following two First Alert alarm options that have strobe lights: [smoke](https://a.co/d/8nMdhBe) and [smoke/CO](https://a.co/d/28eD6yN). I think both of these would be good options for D/HH homes.]

[Another Edit: I also really like [SquareGlow](https://www.squareglow.com/). They are [deaf-owned](https://www.squareglow.com/pages/about-us) and more budget friendly than most, and their products have a modern look and feel. They have a reasonably priced [SOS button](https://www.squareglow.com/collections/accessories/products/squareglow-sos-button) ([SquareGlow on Diglo](https://www.diglo.com/shop-by-alerting-system/squareglow;d=3;c=33;s=341)).

1ombvgx,hardofhearing,partial deaf and ear wax are nightmare for me,"Call this my bad luck or anything, but being a cerumen and partially deaf is a nightmare for me. The earwax makes it more tough to listen to other people. Also, i have been using earphones a lot lately, which i might think are also a reason for the increase in earwax buildup. I have had this earwax tool and it has performed great till now, however i wonder if someone else is facing a situation like me.

I remove my earwax daily and it has now become an after shower routine for me, as throughout the day the earwax eventually builds up and clogs up the ear.

[댓글]
Earwax problems are  a  common for me too cause when I put on my hearing aids my body makes extra earwax to push out the „foreign  body“. So I think a similar things is prolly happening with your earphones. You might want to wear headphones instead just to be safe

I’m in the same boat and have my ears professionally cleaned about once a year. I wear OTEs and AirPods and it’s just the best thing to do - anyone who wears something in the canal daily and produces a lot of wet wax naturally would generally benefit from getting it looked at occasionally and discussing what cadence of cleaning makes sense.

What hearing we have is so precious that I simply don’t risk doing the removal myself.

Would be worth having a specialist look at it and see if anything could be done medically",2025-11-02 08:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ombvgx/partial_deaf_and_ear_wax_are_nightmare_for_me/
1om5w00,hardofhearing,Looking for an app or device that helps with text to speech?,"Hi I’m currently a student. Lectures are hard with my hearing loss. What are your favorite apps that help with transcribing what the person in front of you is saying into text? Im also looking for a device that does something similar. Thanks! 

[댓글]
I’m a big fan of live transcribe for everyday use, although there does seem to be some difference in accuracy between the free and paid for versions. I’ve never really had a problem with it personally and have found paying for the app worth it. 

I also occasionally use the otter app if I know there’s going to be many different speakers. It also summarises the conversation and allows you to save them to look back on.

I use an iPhone so can’t tell you whether these apps work for android use. Hope you find something that works for you.

Android LiveTranscribe is free and pretty accurate. I have the app on my phone but I also have several cheap Samsung tablets that I use exclusively for LiveTranscribe and several of my friends keep a tablet at their houses with LiveTranscribe in case I come over. It’s nice having a dedicated device so I can use my phone for phone things while having a conversation. It doesn’t differentiate between speakers, but you can have it save your conversations for a period of days.

Lots of decent Speech to Text stuff.

Most people like LiveTranscribe on Android. I mostly used that until I wrote my own app.

If you're in the US you have the right to accommodations per the ADA(for now with the way trump is gutting everything). This means you can use/ get/ demand CART which is like closed captions in class. (Yes, even if you have an ASL interpreter) 

If you're talking about just everyday personal interactions, I use live transcribe but it's always a hit or miss. It often misunderstands to the point of where I'll just put it away bc it's nonsense. 

If you have enough hearing for it to be worthwhile, you can invest in a Roger pen; which is a microphone that connects to your hearing aids for people to talk into.

Both Apple and Android have Live Transcribe or Live Captions built in.

Otter.ai is my preferred app for live transcription, it saves the transcript, although you have to pay.

Innocaption is a free call transcribing app that also offers human transcribers, through the FCC.

Grain.com is my actual favorite app for transcription that I use on my video calls, however it's not live. I use the Zoom or Google or Teams captions during the call and then get the Grain transcript afterwards. Best quality I've found.

But you were looking for a text-to-speech app. How would that help? Shouldn’t you want a speech-to-text app?

for real time lecture transcription, google live transcribe is probably the easiest option if you’re using android since it instantly captions what’s being said. if you want to record lectures and later convert them to text, uniconverter does a good job handling that offline so you don’t have to depend on wifi or cloud services. it’s pretty useful for reviewing notes privately afterward.",2025-11-02 02:20:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om5w00/looking_for_an_app_or_device_that_helps_with_text/
1om4j0o,hardofhearing,I’m new here! Any advice? How are the people here?,"I just got diagnosed with Mild Hearing Loss a couple days ago after teachers and my parents started to realized that I was struggling with my hearing.

It’s only mild of course, so it shouldn’t be a big deal, but I’m kinda worried.

I can barely hear my friends in large crowds, and microphones sometimes don’t help as they echo, making the words sound gibberish or muffled to me.

I can’t understand men well since their voices are deeper, which means I have trouble talking to my dad, brother, and friends that are boys, and it kinda makes me sad.

I think it’s affecting my school life too because I tend to not understand what my teachers are saying, but I’m too scared to ask for them to repeat themselves because I don’t want to be accused of not listening.

Right now I’m teaching myself ASL. I used to do it when I was younger before I grew out of it, so I need to reconnect with it.

But anything else? It kinda hurts to not hear everything, and a bit scary too.

Edit: I’m also teaching myself to lip-read, and it’s actually a bit easier than expected, but I still struggling with it.

[댓글]
We’re all frustrated and exhausted and have commiseration as a group. Get proper hearing aids. ASL is good to learn but you need someone to communicate with and that’s a big expectation.

Welcome to the group. Who diagnosed your hearing loss? Did you have a comprehensive hearing test with an audiologist? Did they review your audiogram and explain what it meant in a way you could understand it? Besides diagnosing you with mild loss what did they recommend? If you’re not understanding in multiple situations they should have recommended some type of assistive devices such as hearing aids. If not, why didn’t they? 
Lots of questions that you deserve to have answered. Many of our first lessons in having hearing loss was the importance of advocating for ourselves. We need and deserve complete information. If you’re in the US check out the Hearing Loss Association of America at hearing loss.org. I’ve learned so much from them and you do t have to be a member to access their resources. You can handle this with help from those who know. Good luck!

Thanks for explaining further. I’m not an audiologist so I hesitate to contradict what you were told after three tests, but I decided to google “no hearing aids for mild hearing loss.” I did so based on your clear description of when you have trouble understanding words. You’re better than most people at identifying and describing your challenges. I do know loss of high frequencies is the most common symptom. It especially impacts how well we understand in noisy environments. Most Google results say people can be helped. Here’s what the Cleveland Clinic (a trusted source) says”:
 Even people with a mild degree of hearing loss may find that they are having trouble hearing what they should. Today’s digital hearing aids give audiologists the capability of programming the aids to fit a wide range of hearing losses. You don’t need to have a lot of hearing loss to find that a hearing loss can cause you a lot of frustration. Persons with a mild hearing loss may find that they have difficulty hearing quiet speech, or hearing someone speaking from a distance. If a hearing loss is negatively affecting your life it’s time to schedule an appointment with an audiologist to find out what amplification options could benefit you. “Hearing aids are for people with a great deal of hearing loss. I just have a mild hearing loss, I don’t need hearing aids.” There are many options available to help people with any degree of hearing loss – from mild to profound. An audiologist can review these options to see which would be the best fit for you!”
 I identify with your frustration but I don’t want to cause you trouble with your provider, so please proceed as you feel comfortable. Sometimes second opinion can be a good idea.",2025-11-02 01:12:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om4j0o/im_new_here_any_advice_how_are_the_people_here/
1om2xz0,hardofhearing,Has anyone experienced this?,"Went for a hearing test yesterday and the results were 3 losses between 1-8hz at 30db and the rest were at 20db in one ear, the other has a drop at 4hz at 40db and the rest were at 15/20db.

For the worse ear, she said a HA wouldn’t help even though I fall short in 3 areas despite working with primary children and having tinnitus. Real world experience was quickly dismissed.

She said if I’d been 70+ she would have given me tablets for the tinnitus (didn’t know that was an option…) and HA’s won’t do anything for the tinnitus.

She asked about the tinnitus and I said it was predominantly in one ear but I could hear it in both. Was I sure it was only one ear because if it was I need an mri but if it’s both I don’t. I’ve had the tinnitus for 10+ years. 

She then asked ‘so what are you going to do?’ and I said get a new job as I can’t hear the children with the background noise so I’m effectively unable to do my job. 

The next statement from her ‘I’ll write a letter and see if you can have one as you’re borderline’ despite being at 3 30db losses. Who exactly is she writing to? 

As I was leaving she ended on saying ‘I’ll put you forward for a HA, if it doesn’t work at least we’ve tried’.

I’m in the north of England and have waited 18 months for the NHS appointment and when I got there I felt I had to beg for help and she was spouting BS, am I the only one or was she right in what she said?

Reading this over I feel it’s more of a vent but I’m curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar? 



[댓글]
I was told by my audiologist that he wouldn’t push me for hearing aids as that was my decision to make. With that being said I’m not sure exactly who she’s writing to. Maybe because your hearing loss isn’t severe enough she’s worried that the manufacturer/ hospital won’t want to float the cost. 









Additionally while I understand that hearing aids aren’t necessarily a treatment for tinnitus I don’t understand why she wouldn’t give you treatment for it. Ask for a second option from someone else and get an appointment with an ent if you haven’t.

Definitely get a second opinion. The NHS is a fantastic resource but it's so overstretched and underfunded, it's a struggle to get the help you're supposed to be entitled to. When you find the right person it's amazing and they can change your life, but it's a fight to find the right professional and then say the right thing to them. I was born deaf but I was 26 by the time I got an appointment with a professor in ENT, I said ""no matter how loud the hearing aids are, nothing ever gets any clearer"" - and because of him, I got my BAHA processor on my 27th birthday :) Before him, they just kept turning my hearing aids up and up and up...

Stand your ground the best you can. Write down everything she said while you can remember it and at the next appointment, ask them to explain everything in detail. Bring a handy hearing person to sit in with you if you've got one. I'm in my thirties but still ask my mum to come with me to these type of appointments because she's great at asking WHO are you writing to, when I'm still processing that she'll write to someone.",2025-11-01 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om2xz0/has_anyone_experienced_this/

Had moderate to severe hearing loss in my left and deaf in my right ear my whole life.

A few weeks ago after my Rituximaub infusion for MS, I noticed something felt off.

Felt plugged up or sounds muted a bit. Went to a CVS MinuteClinic and no signs of ear infection. Went to an ENT and had a bit of wax removed and a hearing test.

Test showed a 5 drop in the 250 range and like 15 in 10k and above.

My ear was puffy from wax removal and both the ENT and my normal audiologist didn't see anything concerning as the changes fell within normal range of error.

If I clear my eustachian tubes everything sounds better. Been taking a generic antihistamine to try and help.

Finally, my hearing aid is an Oticon OPN so not sure if that thing is EOL since its old.

In the meantime I progressed to moderate-severe loss, which was only detected a year ago. I'm just now testing new aids and adjustment is difficult, my world suddenly got really really noisy again. Especially my kids (4 and 6).  
I knew that they are ""of the louder variety"" already. They like loud play (stomping, running, shouting, arguing...) but also their normal talking voice seems louder than average.   
Their father keeps complaining how loud they are (his hearing is very good). And we had neighbours complaining that our kids are too loud (we live in an appartment building).   
And I myself feel that I cannot really assess their noise level. With the new hearing aids they aften seem sooo loud (but the rustling of my jacket is also really loud...), without it's no problem (obviously).  
  
Now It suddenly occured to me: what if it's me being HoH causing my kids to be so loud? That they feel the need to be loud to be heard, literally.

1ojg2sz,hardofhearing,Gaming for hard of hearing,"Hello folks long time Reddit lurker. My question regarding gaming for the hard of hearing involves a predicament, I find that using regular gaming headsets effects my hearing to non hearing levels.

If the issue is you can't hear your surroundings or yourself talking, open back headphones will fix this

Have you considered a tabletop microphone?

Maybe bone conduction headset

If you don‘t wear hearing aids (which you could BT stream the audio with, and control the balance between audio stream and outside world (hearing aid mics)), and if you don‘t want to use open over the ear headphones, there are also ear buds that do not occlude the ear canal (e.g. Sony‘s „LinkBuds Open“).",2025-10-29 20:44:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ojg2sz/gaming_for_hard_of_hearing/

I don't want someone to tell me what it is because I'm going to the doctors in a few days but I am extremely nervous. I have had panic attacks over my blocked hearing for over a year now and now it's clearing up I think I have hearing loss in one ear and it's freaking me out so much I had just thrown up from intense stress. I can't eat or sleep. Any advice, coping, or comfort someone can give? I am 20 and having this young is why I'm panicking so much. I know I'll eventually need a hearing test but my anxiety has been so intense I can't even think about it without panicking. How would you cope with this? I need some encouragement I'm really low

I am hard of hearing beginning in my 30s. It’s tough, I won’t lie to you. It can be very lonely, at least for me, because it’s hard for me to hear in group settings.

However, it truly has made me focus on the type of people that will be supportive of me regardless, which has shown me the type of people I want to have in my life. 

If you do have hearing loss, the most important thing you can do is to get tested. I know firsthand it’s scary as hell, but if you leave hearing loss without treatment (whether that’s steroids, surgery, or hearing aids), your hearing nerve and brain will get used to not having the sound input. That can cause long-lasting damage to both.

So please get tested. Cry and scream at the results if you need to. But please know that having something “wrong” with you, if that’s what the test shows… simply means you’re human. 

Not better. Not worse. Just human.

I had to start therapy and was prescribed Zoloft. Both really helped!

Have they tried putting a tube in your ear with the pressure yet?

Let me ask a few questions, if I might. 

When did this dysfunction occur? Was it a sudden onset? If so, can you tell me the circumstances surrounding it? 

I hear do you live? Have you always lived there?

How are your sinuses?

Have you seen an audiologist, an ENT, genetic counselor?

I have been diagnosed with audio processing disorder since I was a kid, it has gotten worse. But today I went to an audiologist and was told that I do have some hearing loss. It’s nothing too major, but it does affect me daily to the point I read lips. My audiologist said that I now need hearing aids due to the combination of these diagnosis.

Does this make me hearing impaired? I don’t wish to overstep, or disrespect anyone. I am sorry if I do.

Oh to add, I’m kind of scared? Hearing aids are so expensive. Is there anywhere I can find them for something more reasonable?

You could post here or at r/AudiProcDisorder.

Having a processing disorder is often associated with hearing loss (depending on your disorder) they tend to go hand in hand. 

Hearing loss is something EVERYONE will experience in life, I’m glad you’re able to read lips, it’s extremely helpful and you are welcome in EVERY COMMUNITY! 

Please don’t ever feel that what you have, don’t have or feel is what defines YOU. You are YOU. You decide where You feel happiest and own it. Find YOUR PEOPLE, love them as they 🥰 💚💚💚💚 Grow/Go from there/Hear/Here.

I too have auditory processing disorder (ANSD) and all my hearing tests were normal and I finally got to know about ANSD after a ABR/bera test.
For me too, over the years (especially after covid and resulting very limited social interaction) it has become just a little bit difficult to understand people and ask them again and again (specially in noisy enviornment with more than 55 db of background noise). My Audiologist also recommended a hearing device to me.
I guess hearing issues does form a broad spectrum and we all can share and learn from each other's perspective and experience 😃

Plus you’ll prolly still find usefull/relatable info

I’ve never heard the term Auditory Processing Disorder, but it sounds like me. 

I lost 40% of the hearing in my left ear in 1995. But the loss was to the tone test. When it comes to identifying the sound, or speech, or what direction the sound comes from, I can’t do that with the left ear. If the right ear is brought into play, my comprehension score comes up, but still not anywhere near 100%. I also still can’t tell what direction sound comes from. 

Is that what ANSD is?

I was born an estimated 50% deaf in my right ear, although I’d debate that I’m more 75%, sounds that’d be painfully loud are like soft voices. But my left ear can hear fine, although I’ve admittedly given myself tinnitus from years of poor choices with earbud volume. 

Especially since you need hearing aids, I think the label would fit for you. I don’t even have hearing aids right now, although lord knows I’m trying.

Audioprocessing is a neurological condition that affects how your brain processes audio. Physically, you still have the ability  to hear. 

Hearing loss  is physical. Loss of hearing.  

2 separate things. They actually have a reddit for APD, though. 

I don't think you need permission from strangers on the internet it's a free country. 

You do what feels best 👌🏼

That is absolutely not true. 

Not all processing disorders are related to auditory dysfunction. 

For example, you can be dyslexic and deaf. You can have sensory textile processing disorders and be deaf. You can have cognitive dissonance disorders and be deaf. 
There’s a whole SLEW of processing disorders that have and don’t have anything to do with the auditory system. 
The issue is there is not a set of official guidelines in the ICD-11 Consult or the DSM5-TR, in fact, currently Processing Disorders and APD are not included in either due to a whole slew of factors. 

(Mainly, they don’t know jack shit about ANY of these so they can’t properly explain, diagnose nor treat them. If you haven’t LIVED or experienced a processing disorder, how, I ask, will you understand it?    You don’t. )",2025-10-28 22:59:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oioaz7/im_unsure_if_i_am_allowed_to_be_apart_of_the/
1oil0cp,hardofhearing,Can't find reliable sound-sensor/vibration system,"I've been looking for a bed-shaker system that will alert me to sounds. I've tried two or three models, but they all have this really frustrating and confusing wrinkle: the sound sensors that transmit to them only detect LONG sounds. They often seem to be marketed as ""baby cry sensors.""

That is, they'll detect most ringtones, or a person going ""AHHHHHHHHH!"", but they won't detect a person *shouting* my name (which is just one syllable). More worryingly, I found that the one I'm using currently won't even reliably detect a smoke detector going off, even when the smoke detector is right next to the sensor!! Presumably this is because the smoke detector beeps are very short and/or high-pitched. I have no idea why this ""long sounds only"" feature is a thing. Maybe they want to protect from waking you when a door opens or closes? But hell, if it'd disturb a hearing person, I'd like it to disturb me!

Does anyone use a sound sensor/vibration system, and have you found one that is reliable for short sounds?

1ohnf3v,hardofhearing,95 year old grandfather can’t hear almost anything on phone through hearing aids &amp; barely anything in person through them. I tested him using earbuds &amp; he could hear great. Should I set him up like this permanently or are there risks to what little heading he has left?,"His hearing doctor is also a ways away and has not seemed to be helpful in the past and it’s a huge headache to get him to that doctor, so I’m hoping to just do this myself but don’t want to ruin his existing hearing.

I’d have to buy and replace his phones (wireless home phones) with phones that have a headphone jack.

Before I do all of that I’m wondering if there’s a better approach. I know they have hearing impaired phones with a large speaker but I’m unsure if those will be any better than just yelling into his ear. I know the earbuds work. I’m also wondering if I should be considering over ear headphones that way he doesn’t have to take his hearing aids out and tell people “hold on” every time someone calls, but I know in the past overear headphones for watching TV have interfered with his hearing aids and caused them to shut off, unsure if that’s because the over ear headphones for his TV were wireless though. So I just want to keep things as simple/reliable as possible while also not damaging his hearing. And considering his hearing is already damages are there are volume limitations I should set up/get a pair of headphones that CANT go past a certain db reading to further damage his hearing? 

Furthermore, if this works out I’m wondering if I should be thinking about alternatives for his hearing aid situation in general. He can’t hear at all on the phone and he can barely hear in person, so I’m wondering if I should look into/make a setup that is basically just earbuds permanently in place of hearing aids but with a Microphone strapped to his hip or whatever (possibly a directional microphone that points where he is looking/at the person he’s talking to?) that then feeds to his hearing aids? And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

I’m just past the point of wanting to go through the Dr because he’s went to this Dr many times and cannot hear a damned thing through his hearing aids yet I use a random pair of earbuds from home and he could hear clear as day. So I’m hesitant to burn 10+ hours going back and forth to Dr to get new hearing aids and spend a bunch of money for something proprietary that might not even work. 

[댓글]
I think he needs a new doctor to check his hearing if possible

See a new audiologist. Why keep going back if you're not getting what you want out of it.

If he is able,  transcription apps allow us to l read what is being said irt....  A way to keep communication open until his audiologist helps

Another vote for a new doctor. 

When you say Hearing Doctor, I want to be sure we are on the same page. I’m talking about an ENT, or a licensed Audiologist with a partnership with an ENT, at the least. Please don’t take him to one of the mass market hearing aid places. I’m referring to Beltone, Miracle Ear, Clear Tone etc. 

I’m sorry to say there are too many people out there that don’t want to invest the extra time it takes to work with some of our older seniors. Your Grandfather is a member of the greatest generation that ever lived, and we all owe them a debt of gratitude. A little extra time spent working with them sometimes results in hearing about history we didn’t know.

New doctor/audiologist.

There's transcription apps. **Live Transcribe** is popular and works well. I have one too but its not out in eu yet.

Earbuds like for a walkman or amplifier? Or AirPods? If it's the latter, if that works hey, I mean not really recommended but ppl are doing that. If it's the former, eh. Do they have costco where you are? They'll do an audiogram with their in house audiologists and sell you a hearing aid and not an amplifier.

They have multiple (hardware) transcription devices for phones too. I have moderate hearing loss and I rarely have any idea what anyone is saying on the phone. I just put it on speaker and tell people to feel free to shout. I'm ok on zoom etc since I speechread.

&gt;And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

Nothing works in a crowded room, it's why I won't generally wear hearing aids. That was the only thing that mattered for where I used to work (teaching). It was listening to a cacophony of overlapping human speech. Focusing on a single speaker was like picking out water drops in the rain. When you amplify that it's just a louder cacophony, not easier to discriminate sounds or speakers.

A lot of hearing aids just do not work well either and many audiologists are just glorified (hearing) appliance salespeople. I think you found one of those w/your grandfather.

Hope that helps and lots of luck! *fingers crossed*

It's wild how regular earbuds sometimes work better than expensive hearing aids. Just be careful with the volume so it doesn't blast his ears even if he can't hear well. You could also look into OTCs. They're kind of the middle ground between regular earbuds and full-on prescription hearing aids. My FIL has the audien ion pro and they've been amazing for everyday stuff without the constant doctor trips.

I wonder if government phones might have some of those helpful hearing impaired phones I've never heard of that but I'm about to ask them if they do if you have those government phones where you are I would try that too but definitely a new audiologist if this one isn't helping it's a lot of searching around for the perfect one but I'm sure you'll find maybe a better one closer",2025-10-27 19:07:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ohnf3v/95_year_old_grandfather_cant_hear_almost_anything/

To cut a long story short, I’m looking for some sort of system or device that can wake someone up who is hard of hearing. This would be for emergencies only when they are needed in the night.

Any recommendations?

you want a company like this... https://bellman.com/en/our-solutions/visit-smart-home/ they specialise in hard of hearing alerting systems. any audiologist should help or follow their link to stockists. you need a package of things though... not cheap but robust, simple and effective. bed shakers, flashing lights. etc. can be linked to phones.. also good for smoke alarms!!

I find a smart watch to be the best.

I use a smartwatch in place of an alarm clock.  The vibrations wake me up.

You can get a disk that vibrates to put olunder your pillow, and that's connected to the alarm systems. Some people have lights that will flash too.

1oh8iyj,hardofhearing,Can I get a hearing test without a doctor ordering it?,"Hi,

Does anyone know if there is a way that I can get a hearing test without a doctor's order? I know I can do that at Costco, but they only let you get one every six months, and I last had a hearing test four months ago. But if I’ve experienced sudden hearing loss now, I need to get treatment *now*. Not two months from now. Also, if I get a hearing test without a doctor's order, my medical insurance probably won’t pay for it. So I'm also wondering how much a hearing test actually costs, if I have to pay out of pocket. Thanks!

[댓글]
For sudden unexplained hearing loss your dr should get you in right away. Outside of Costco i don’t know whereas you could to get a hearing test not approved by a dr. I think the amount it cost can vary state to state so to be on the safe side you should google your area

I have no idea what the situation state-side is (where I presume you are?) but in Canada I was definitely able to just call up a hearing clinic and ask them for an appointment directly (I didn't have a GP at the time).

You need to see an ENT, not just an audiologist at a hearing aid shop. Call your insurance to see if you need Referral

I walked into the local clinic and said I think I'm going deaf ... No doctors no papers they set me up with an appointment. Now may differ based on location though

I've never had a doctor order a hearing test recently before 2020. I have been the one ordering them. I go to the office that deals with my hearing aids or the hospital where I had my CI surgery.

The hearing aid places will give you a free hearing test to sell you hearing aids, they are audiologists. You just have to be prepared to walk away &amp; finagle your results. That’s a quick, free answer before you see your ENT (not a substitute for)

Try free phone apps or Costco

You need to call your insurance company and ask them!",2025-10-27 07:56:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oh8iyj/can_i_get_a_hearing_test_without_a_doctor/

[댓글]
I have the oticon ones with the actual hearing aid that sits behind the ear and the molded earpiece that goes into the ear. It is quite easy just to pull that bit out. —as opposed to hearing aids that are just little buds or something.

Anyway, so Yes, absolutely I will just pull the ear piece out and let them hang until whatever foolishness is over with.

Edit: I don’t know why, but your question reminded me of a story about Ian McKellan. He’d gone to see a play where one of his friends was starring. Afterwards he was giving the usual praise about how much he enjoyed it, and the friend replied, “We could tell you enjoyed it, you didn’t even take out your hearing aids!” Idk why that tickled me so much. Maybe bc I’d never thought about being “caught” doing it!

Ugh, loud sudden noises are rough. You can try asking your audiologist to tweak your compression settings. It can help dampen sharp spikes like that. Personally, I use audien ion pro and they seem a bit less reactive to sharp noise compared to my older ones. They got quick-switch profiles for noisy places so I can just tap to tone things down.

I really only wear mine to work or to situations where I need to understand every single word. The world is so noisy. If I'm just going out to run errands or at home I will typically leave them out and rely on lip reading and asking for clarification. I can still hear lots of things but it's easier to tune out. I do get easily overwhelmed when I wear them in a loud environment. I will turn them all the way down, or like the other comment said just pop the speakers out of my ear canals

If the sounds are bothering you, turn your hearing aids down or off! That's what I do; there's no use hearing when it does more harm than good, especially for loud noises that can actually damage your hearing in the long run.

Hearing aids don't help me in most situations- im HOH in one ear- it actually overstimulates me in situations where there is more than one person or child talking

I work in an upper elementary school in SPED. I’ve absolutely taken my hearing aids out while dealing with a student who is escalated and being very loud. It’s damaging my hearing by leaving them in, not to mention probably going to trigger a vertigo attack for me. Maybe it’s rude, but tbf I don’t think my students have ever noticed it in the moment.

I am in the same situation.  I had my audiologist set one of the buttons on my hearing aides to mute so I can quickly mute when a loud sound happens.  I live in the city so the ambulances and fire trucks are super loud.  When I take the subway I wear Sony earphones over the ear kind over my hearing aides.  I don’t even turn them on or anything ,  just having them up over my hears is enough to dull the screeching subway trains.  I also have a custom “ calm” setting that I made for noisy situations where I still want to hear but way softer like noisy restaurants or my office where the loud overhead AC vents drive me nuts..

I struggle with this situation - and am not convinced that wearing hearing aids in loud areas doesn't further damage your ears.  Doesn't the loud noise you no longer hear still damage your hearing??

I recently opted to put earplugs in my ears when out on long walks rather than wear my hearing aids.  The every increasing traffic noise has been too much for me - I stopped looking forward to walks.   So now I just leave hearing aids at home and plug my ears with those simple foam ear plugs to reduce the decibels.  I can still hear the hum of traffic and my head swivels around paying attention to the traffic, people, cyclists etc around me.  My ears no longer hurt after a long walk, since I cut out the over exposure to noise. 

I don't believe that my decision to remove hearing aids and wear ear plugs is ideal  - but it still doesn't make sense that wearing aids in loud environments doesn't further harm my hearing; especially when my ears physically hurt after lengthy exposure to environment.  It's not like you can quickly cover your ears when a car or store alarm goes off.

I am interested in this post and look forward to reading all comments.

I honestly just pop open the battery compartments so the hearing aids *block* noise instead

Unfortunately the answer you don’t want to hear is……. You get what you pay for, I have a profound hearing loss and have worn hearing aides since I was 22.  I am now 56, and have grown through all of the technological advancements.  Set aside the arguments that you shouldn’t have to pay this much to hear and just accept reality, it is what it is.
Get the absolute highest technology from a reputable doctor of audiology and you will find this day and age has automatic noise reduction built in.  They will automatically turn down the volume when sensing the incoming volume is a certain percentage above ambient sound.  Obviously it’s more complicated than that but we don’t need to know the physics, we just want to hear.  You will find it strange at first when it happens because it will also give you a perceived pressure change that takes some getting used to.
Make sure you get quality custom ear molds and a quality audiologist that will be patient with you.  After I get my new ones it typically takes about 6 weeks of at east once a week appointments for the audiologist to get them dialed in for my use.  If they are not willing, they are not worth your money.  Remember, if your audiologist is not hearing impaired themselves, they do not know what it’s like to have this affliction.

You should speak to Elivania Abreu, Fonoaudióloga

You have a high frequency hearing loss. Search for ""speech banana"", map your loss,  and you can see the speech you will miss . Your audiologist should be able to give you an explamation. If they can't,  find a new one!.

The line in red goes down and then up a little bit, the other line goes down not as rapidly.

In short, you can hear (roughly) normally in most frequencies, but you don't hear higher pitched sounds nearly as well. Your ears are roughly the same, but your left ear is your better ear. This may mean you have trouble hearing certain speech sounds and quiet high pitched noises like electricity whine, whispering, sounds from small animals and insects, etc. It doesn't mean that you *can't* hear those noises, just that you have more difficulty than the typical person. 

I'm not an audiologist, just hard of hearing myself, so I can't say whether hearing aids would be needed, but if your audiologist/hearing aid tech recommends them, I would look into it if financially feasible. Unaided hearing loss has been linked to increased rates of dementia in later life, so it does have implications for brain health.

Looks like mine from 5 years ago.

The line of the left is percentage of sound heard compared to normal hearing. The negative # is better than normal. The numbers on the top are frequency starting from very low to medium sound, drums, vibration, low notes pretty well but I can't hear higher so high women's voices. (ie soprano}, become indisputably non existent.

Disclaimer: I am not an audiologist, but from my understanding as someone who has studied audiology in undergrad,
You have a bilateral high frequency hearing loss that is slightly asymmetrical. The degree in your right ear is moderately severe at high frequencies (over 4k Hz), and the degree in your left is is moderate at high frequencies (over 4k Hz). At all other frequencies (4k and below) you have normal hearing. It looks like you only had air conduction tested, and without also testing bone conduction, the type of loss cannot be determined for certain.

I want this hearing : (

X-axis is the frequency of the sound.


Y-axis is how loud that frequency has to be in order for you to hear it.


The shaded area is a normal range of hearing. Anything in the white area indicates hearing loss in that frequency. The lower you go, the worse the hearing loss is.


You have moderate high frequency hearing loss.",2025-10-24 19:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1of7maq/can_you_explain_my_audiogram_in_detail_if_possible/

1ode1rg,hardofhearing,Sudden hearing loss after blowing my nose – anyone had this and recovered?,"I’m 25 and a today I was congested from a cold. I tried to pop my ears by blowing gently into my closed nose — and I felt a small “pop” in my left ear.

Right after that, I got dizzy, nauseous, and even threw up once. Since then, my left ear feels full, I hear almost nothing from it, and there’s constant ringing.

I went to the ENT today and got diagnosed with:

Sudden hearing loss (hypoacusis) due to barotrauma

The eardrum looks fine (not ruptured), but they confirmed significant hearing loss on the left side. Tomorrow I’m going for another hearing test and likely steroid treatment.

Has anyone here experienced sudden hearing loss after pressure / blowing your nose, and did your hearing recover?
How long did it take, and did you do any specific treatments (steroids, oxygen therapy, etc.)?

[댓글]
It very possible that this can be an issue that can be corrected by having tubes (or a tube) put in ear(s).

Can you describe what you hear? Is it muffled/stuffy? Like it seems like your ears are suddenly stuffed?

Go to emergency, if there is any chance that the loss is due to lack of blood/oxygen to the ear, the longer you wait the higher chance of permanent hearing loss.

I had the same issue, after like 4 days it turns  out to be pressure difference between the ear and the environment. I was also sick, maybe my ear was infected and it cleared itself

Could be a round window fistula

Sudden hearing loss like this should be seen as soon as possible by a dr. According to many credible medical sites  (NIH in the UK, Harvard medical and Mayo clinic in the US) you have about a10-14 day window to address this (assuming it continues) without at least some permanent hearing loss resulting. The longer you delay, the more likely so e or all hearing loss will be unrecoverable.",2025-10-22 17:04:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ode1rg/sudden_hearing_loss_after_blowing_my_nose_anyone/
1oddo6v,hardofhearing,Any tips???,"So for the past month my hearing has been deteriorating and I have been struggling to hear people a lot. For context I work in a very busy cafe/bakery and there are voices constantly which is quite annoying for me. I was wondering if people had any tips to help keep my focus on what people are saying to me. I want to try lip reading but I’m not able to in my job as I have to look at a bunch of screens while people are talking to me. I already had a complaint from this woman who shouted at me from across the place and I didn’t hear her and when I explained my situation she said “we’ll fix your hearing then” lady if I could I would mate but luckily my boss is so lovely she went over to the woman and asked her not to speak to me like that so I am very thankful for my colleagues and managers. But it is just hard on me aswell as work I also go to school for engineering in an airport so I have alot of noises going on in the workshop which makes it hard to hear people which is a recipe for disaster
I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, I don’t have any resources to get to my closest doctor and my mum won’t drive me 😢😢 that just puts out any hearing aids for me but oh well I think I can manage without them I would just like tips on how to keep focus on people and lip reading!! Thank you 

[댓글]
You need to get a dr. There very little that can be done until you know what your hearing is. Medical help is a right in most countries and not getting a child medical attention is neglect and not legal in most places.



















Furthermore lip reading is not an exact science  and while there are classes for lip reading and sign language if you don’t have the resources to get to the dr i don’t see how you would get to lip reading classes.

Agreed, find a way to get a hearing test whether it be someone driving you or an uber. You can try to work on auditory training to hear in the presence of background noise, such as listening to an audiobook while they’re another source of sound like a tv show on to try to train your brain to filter out extraneous noise. but ultimately, hearing test is your better move

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Like the others, I urge you to prioritize getting to the doctor as soon as possible, preferably to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist, but in the very least to a primary care physician, understanding that you likely will need to follow up with an ENT. I know it’s difficult to take time off for work for medical appointments, but some hearing loss is treatable. Also, some hearing losses need to be treated as soon as possible for the best chance of recovering hearing. 

Lip reading is a helpful context clue for understanding what’s been said, but it’s more an aid than a solution, as many words look similar (e.g., “I love you” and “olive juice”). There are live closed captioning apps (system accessibility settings, apps like Live Transcribe) that can assist with in person and telephone communication. 

One difficulty it sounds like you may have is communicating when your vision has to be directed toward screens (unless you can have a transcription program running at the bottom of the screen that detects and transcribes nearby speech). Sighted deaf and hard of hearing individuals often are highly dependent upon their vision for communication, and adapting to a newly acquired hearing loss takes considerable visual cuing at first. 

Again, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Prioritize your medical treatment, then work on finding the best communication options for you. There may be support services for the deaf and hearing impaired in your area, and it would be good to reach out to them too. 

Best of luck!

[EDIT: Wanted to add that hearing aids can be life changing for some people experiencing hearing loss that can be remediated. You should definitely try them if given the opportunity. They might be the best solution for you. However, do keep in mind that noisy environments create challenges no matter what solution you’re using.]",2025-10-22 16:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oddo6v/any_tips/

1oabq2k,hardofhearing,The idea of a device that allows you to feel orchestral music through vibrations,"Hello everyone! I'm a sound engineer, and I want to make classical music concerts more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing.

The idea: a device called ""Touchestra"" — a small board that represents an orchestra map, divided into sections (percussion, strings, woodwinds, brass, etc.). When a section starts playing, its corresponding sector lights up and begins vibrating at its own unique frequency.

And before I proceed with any further work, I need your feedback!!

1. Would something like this even be in demand? Could it help deaf individuals get closer to the music of a symphony orchestra?
2. Do you attend classical music concerts? If yes/no — why?
3. Will different vibration frequencies be perceptible at all?
4. What inclusion options have you seen in practice, or have you simply thought about?

I welcome any and all answers; it's important for me to see opinion from my target audience. It's better for me to understand if it's needed now than to create something that finds no application.

1oa2nue,hardofhearing,A victim of my fathers hearing aids,"Dear Hard of Hearing Community,

Edit: I've the the same question worded differently and as I'm new to this I didn't know that it was pretty important, but should have realized that it is: the model I believe is rexton reach r-li t, it things that go in the ears are custom fitted. All of this has been done through public healthcare (Denmark) so I don't know that much but at least I think the fit is to standard but would most likely have been even better done in the private sector. Finally I've never heard the sound when his ears are covered all though that doesn't happen often, I've only heard it when he is messing with the software settings on his app and he never adjust anything sound wise on hearing aid themselves. Thank you for all the curious questions and suggestions to far


I’m reaching out as a victim of my father’s recently prescribed hearing aids, hoping that someone here or maybe a relative of a hard of hearing person can answer my question.

So, he got these hearing aids that he *does* need. They’re fairly ""modern"", which means they come with a lovely little app that lets him adjust the volume, sensitivity, and all sorts of other settings.

Here’s my problem—and the reason I feel like a victim of them:  
Why the F@$# do they have to make a horrendous sound every single time he makes even a single microadjustment?!

Why does it have to sound like a thousand grasshoppers screeching right next to my ear, in a tone so high that any not hard of hearing person above the age 40 probably can’t even hear it?  
Why does my hearing have to suffer just because he’s tweaking his hearing aids through some app?!

Please, I need this explained. I'm losing my mind 

—A 24-year-old victim of his father’s hearing aids

  
P.S**.** He’s a 61-year-old fiddler, so he loves to adjust the app often, also when I’m visiting, forgetfull of (having commented on the horrendous sound) and obviously unable to hear the sound currently MESSING WITH MY MIND.

I, and all my friends, noticed my lack of hearing around 16 yrs old. Since then it has been a constant conversation through school, meeting my husband, and at work. Well, 10+ years later I finally go take a hearing test. I was SHOCKED when the audiologist recommended two hearing aids. Just wondering if anyone has a similar “cookie bite” and if you have noticed any more decreases throughout the years. 

I understand that since this is genetic, I really can’t base anything off of others experiences. But purely curious! 

Thanks in advance!

Cookie bite here, similar story as you.  In my late teens people kept telling me to go get the wax cleaned out of my ears and whatnot, heh.  I knew it was there, my wife and I joked that I was the eyes and she was the ears, but I didn't deal with it until 45 years old and it was really affecting both my work and personal life.  I did feel like it was getting worse. 

Hearing aids have been life-changing, I really didn't even realize just how much of the world I was missing.

I have cookie bite loss, I don’t know how much loss there’s really been aside from the typical slight loss in the 8k range, which for me is still above average (?!). My hearing loss was first suspected in second grade, but my parents never really followed through about it until I was 17 and got a pair of hearing aids that really worked for me. They help so much because I always say “I wasn’t meant to hear people”, as my loss is focused similarly around where most speech falls. The difference with them in and out is day and night. At home it doesn’t matter so much, but being able to function at work and having conversations is so worth having hearing aids for. If you can get a pair, I think you’ll find them worth it. I found myself much less exhausted because I wasn’t trying so hard to hear all of the time.

Oh wow, yours is like perfect cookie bite. I have that as well, i had hearing aids in elementary school, hated them and quit by third grade, tried again in high school, gave up within a year. In my early 30s i finally admitted i was struggling more, and got another hearing test done. My cookie bite is now a cookie bit, the ends have evened out to a pretty steady across the board loss with a smaller dip in the middle, but the upside is hearing aid technology is wayyy better!

Welcome to the club buddy! I’ve had cookie bite as a teen and my chart is a little more C shaped but about the same :)

I don’t have a deaf community I’m ingrained in or have a job that can accommodate me easily (I’m a teacher) so HA it is and it’s been a life changer for me to be able to work in the hearing world.

Mine looks almost exactly like yours but more symmetrical. I have noticed a bit of a decline since I started wearing aids and have had them modified a bit. I didn’t start wearing them until about 5 years ago (37) but probably needed them in my 20s. I haven’t figured out which side of my family the hearing loss is from. I really benefitted from aids in conversations. Good luck!

Cookie bite here. Mine has been steady for about 15 years.

TIL of cookie bite hearing loss! I thought it was so weird you had loss in the middle frequencies instead of high like most.

Just curious from the professionals, who is able to adapt better to understanding speech with hearing aids?  Those with a cookie bite loss or those with high frequency loss?  I'm observing the comments about how much hearing aids helped the cookie bites. I'm a high frequency loss person but it's still a struggle even with the aids in both ears. So, just wondering what the professionals say?

33. Also cookie bite. Had hearing issues my whole life and got hearing aids just over a month ago. It’s been a huge improvement in my day to day.

Basically same story (34f) - sister kinda always knew, then high school it was fairly obvious/a joke that I was deaf. There were a lot of signs in my 20s, e.g wondered why phones never turned up to an understandable volume 😂, starting to need subtitles for the tv. 

It was shockingly apparent at the start of COVID-19. Couldn’t hear a word through the masks🫠 got hearing tests and the technician was so confused “normally the line goes straight up that way or  that way if it’s not perfect… 👀” (went to proper audiologist and ENT soon after). 

Been using hearing aids for a few years now. They work pretty good, but still more hard of hearing than everyone else with them in. Thanks for sharing",2025-10-14 19:18:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o6owmt/hearing_test_results_and_hearing_aids_at_27/
1o653ju,hardofhearing,"For my fellow HoH Android users - I made a free app like Live Transcribe, but with the 'Save' button we always needed.","Hey everyone,

Like many of you folks, I'm Hard of Hearing. While I think Google's Live Transcribe is a fantastic tool, I always got frustrated by one thing: I couldn't save the transcript. It was useless for practical things like taking down my mother's grocery list, because the text would disappear as soon as I closed the app.

I've seen this sentiment shared here before, and I was especially inspired to finish this up after seeing the great app a developer made for his HoH partner on iOS last month. I wanted to make sure us Android users had a great option, too. 

So, I built Transcriboar. It's live now and it's 100% free.

Link to Transcriboar on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neonsnake.transcriboar

Think of it as Live Transcribe, but with all the features we need to actually use the text later:

* Save transcripts to your phone
* Edit and Rename saved files
* Share the text with other apps
* Print directly

And, of course, a cool boar logo, which was a significant feature I felt Live Transcribe also lacked.

Most importantly, it's truly free and private. Everything is stored locally on your device. There is no cloud, no data recording, and no expensive AI subscription. I used the same fast, free, and reliable API that Google already provides.

Please be kind, I'm just one guy who built this in his kitchen. I wasn't compensated and I don't make any money from this. I just wanted to build something that would genuinely help me and, hopefully, others in our community.

Thanks for checking it out.

P.S. / Important Info:

* Privacy Policy: https://neonsnake.com/privacy.html
* More Info: https://neonsnake.com/transcriboar.html
* Availability Note: Currently, the app is live in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. I'm working to expand this to many more countries very soon

You are an amazing one guy who built this in your kitchen. Maybe the best

Thank you so much.  Transcription was so critical during my husband illness and it was frustrating not to be able to have the conversion to refer back to. 
I just downloaded the app and will try it out tomorrow.

this is an excellent initiative and an example of your brilliance!

Hello! It's not available in my country (Malaysia) yet but I just wanted to say a HUGE THANK YOU for putting in the time and your expertise to build this app. I saw the same post last month on the iOS app and totally wished someone would do the same for us Android users haha...
But truly, life already can be so challenging and it's kind &amp; giving people like you who make such a difference in our HoH community.

FYI just pushed an update to the play store for the Android 11 folks, should be out (hopefully) by tomorrow-ish.

* Fixed Transcription on Android 11 devices, works reliably on tested devices
* Resolved an issue that prevented the microphone from starting on certain Android 11 phones.
* Minor Performance improvements and bug fixes

Thanks for all the patience and feedback!

1o5trpx,hardofhearing,Living with reverse-slope hearing loss: worried about progression!,"Hey people!

I (28M) was diagnosed with RSHL (reverse slope hearing loss) about six years ago. My ENT identified a genetic factor as the main cause, and I got fitted with hearing aids right away. They've made a huge difference in my daily life, honestly, I can't imagine getting by without them.

I just had my yearly checkup today, and when we compared my recent audiogram to the one from four years ago, it showed a 15 dB drop in both ears. That was a bit unsettling to see. 

I'm wondering if anyone here has RSHL or a similar type of progressive genetic hearing loss. Have you noticed your hearing changing significantly over time? Is gradual decline something that tends to happen with this type of loss, or can it sometimes stabilise?

I know everyone's hearing journey is different, but I'd really appreciate hearing about your experiences. It's been on my mind a lot today, especially thinking of what things might look like in 15 years down the line if the rate of decline stays the same. 

Thanks for taking the time to read!!

I’m a grad student at Northwestern studying design, and my thesis focuses on how hearing parents learn to communicate and connect after finding out their child is deaf or hard of hearing.

I came across a few stories online that really stayed with me, and I wanted to understand more about what that experience is like from those who’ve lived it, whether as someone HoH or Deaf, a parent, or a teacher or interpreter who’s supported families in that stage.

I’m hoping to learn from real experiences, not to design *for* anyone, but to better understand what helps parents and kids connect and what makes that process harder. I know it’s a deeply personal topic, and I want to approach it with care and respect.

If you’re open to sharing, I’d be so grateful to hear your thoughts here or privately by DM if that feels more comfortable. Either way, thank you for taking the time to read this and for creating such a welcoming community.

I don’t really see where the design come in, since connection is about the human to human communication.

I know it’s uncomfortable to do, but asking the speaker to use a microphone and use it correctly is valid. It’s will probably help others who are having a hard time hearing too.

For work? Think about what kind of reasonable accommodations would enable you to do your job (like getting the info in writing, research solutions for better live captions) and talk to your manager or HR about it.

I don't know of any groups for HOH teachers, but I will share my experiences in the classroom as a HOH teacher. This seems more like a classroom management problem more than a HOH problem. The better your classroom management is, the less ""talking"" you are going to have to contend with. This isn't to say that ***you*** are doing things the wrong way, just that there are small changes that you can make to lessen the talking going on in your classroom.

* Set the expectations by enforcing noise levels. In my school we use the 3-0 scale. 3 is recess/assembly level, 2 is general talking/hallway levels, 1 is whisper (can only be heard by the person next to you), and 0 is no talking/noise at all. When we are in the classroom, the expectation is that noise levels do not raise above 1. Holding up a 0 or 1 is the signal for students to mirror your gesture and bring it down to that level. Hold up the 0 or 1 until all students have theirs raised.
* Use prompts like ""If you can hear the sound of my voice, clap once/clap twice"" at a low level and increase claps until the room is silent, or hold up your hand and count down from 5. At 1 the class should be silent. These work well with Proximity or the use of a microphone. Walk around the room so you know students can hear you in all parts of the room without the need to raise your voice.
* Reiterate these expectations every time you use these prompts, and be consistent. These are strategies that work at all grade levels. Also reiterate the expectation when you release students for individual or group work. ""We will be working in groups/individually. The expectation during this time is that the noise level will remain at a 1/0.""
* Proximity is a great way to get students to focus. If students are being too loud, go stand next to/over them. They quiet down pretty quickly when they have their teacher standing within inches of them. However if you are sitting at your desk or helping a student across the classroom, they are more likely to be talking loudly or goofing off.
* Use a microphone in the classroom hooked up to the classroom speakers or a bluetooth speaker while you are giving instruction. While it won't directly stop the talking going on during the lesson/lecture portion of your instruction, it will lessen it because now they are contending with the volume of your voice drowning out their own whispering.
* Keep students busy. If they are talking, this means they either don't have any work (they finished early), or the work they do have isn't mentally stimulating them enough to where they have to focus to complete the assignment. Additionally, set a time limit (with visual timers) for work you assign that is tight enough that students who aren't focusing will not be able to complete it in time.

I wish I could join a support club with you. I have exactly the same classroom management struggles.

i work in a deaf school so im not sure, but maybe assign a classroom job of “noise monitor”?

I’m a deaf (but use ha) teacher of high school age hearing students. A decade in, I’m over trying to police what they say. If they can say it where I don’t hear them then  it’s not my problem. They know I’m deaf and if they need me I have to see them and see their mouths. They learn quickly how to interact with me

I am a Deaf educator. I have a hearing TA but. I work in a school for the Deaf. My students are very helpful for figuring who or where noises came from if they saw or heard it too. 

I am sure there are a couple of others on here and r/deaf. Maybe I could create a facebook group.

I would love to join a group. I find this a struggle and I have a co-teacher who is hearing. It’s frustrating because I can’t hear them and I feel like they think I’m ignoring the students when we should be completely silent.

I used to teach High School to hearing students. It was a chore to police the use of cell phones since I am high frequency deaf. The students cought on that I did not hear the rings. Ugh. I just couldn't and ended up quitting. I hope it gets better and easier for you.

I am HoH and teach hearing University students. When they gave me a teaching role I was very clear that the struggle would be real, and they assured me I would be fine and then I wasn't. And on top of it I lost even more hearing towards the end of my first semester of teaching. Our disability services team couldn't link me up with any other HoH educators. The University has now put supports in place for me, like giving me much more lead in time to prepare, and becoming ok with me taking all of my tech everywhere.

I love your idea. Please set up a group.",2025-10-12 14:41:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o4qt3o/i_am_a_hoh_teacher_are_there_any_support_groups/
1o47dz3,hardofhearing,reverse slope (low frequency loss) and hearing aids,"hi all. looking to get hearing aids after 10+ years of not having them. 

my issues in the past were that the background noise would be amplified, and mask any high frequency speech sounds that i could already hear making it harder to hear with the hearing aids on. 

i was curious how tech has changed in the last 10 years. are hearing aids beneficial to you?

[댓글]
Been wearing hearing aids since I was a toddler. Audiologists have this mindset of only following your audiogram, but you have the right to tell them that it’s not your preference and you need the sound brought forward or the speech levels need to be amplified, whatever. 

Trust me. I have had multiple confrontations with audiologists over the years over this. They need reminding that YOU are the user and what you need goes. Don’t be afraid to push back as hard as you need to. 

Other than that, I’ve been told hearing aid tech has improved immensely but I’m not sure how, other than we have bluetooth and rechargeable battery capabilities now. The downside is the programming tracks the frequency and length of the wearing period which gets me scolded because I never wear them alone, which is 99% of the time.

Anyway, find your IDGAF energy and an audiologist you like and get fitted. Lol. Happy wearing! :)

I had reverse slope hearing loss, though it's leveled off and is pretty flat these days, so take it with a grain of salt. That said, couple things:

1. It took time for my ears to adjust to the new sounds. Keyboard presses sounded like gunshots, the air conditioner was deafening. I got used to it only after wearing my HAs all day for several weeks straight - your brain has to adapt.
2. It took several rounds of programming to dial in the right settings. I visited my audiologist monthly or even twice a month for the first 6 months or so, then every three months after that for a couple years. It's amazing how much of a difference tuning makes.",2025-10-11 21:30:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o47dz3/reverse_slope_low_frequency_loss_and_hearing_aids/

Deaf people are already less likely to get into an auto crash. Maybe you could look o to accessibility devices to help hearing people drive better.

You don’t really need hearing to drive. In fact, one of the biggest prejudices there are about the Deaf community is that we can’t drive. I have personally participated in research that showed that we HoH and Deaf drive **more** safely than average, because of paying visual attention to the traffic better, for example a more consistent and appropriate use of rear mirrors, and so on. Your project therefore doesn’t really solve a problem, but rather contributes to cementing misconceptions.

Note, we don’t really need to communicate using speech when driving, we don’t need to hear what people say and we aren’t socially excluded when driving.

I’d recommend doing much more research before starting a project.

I went to the other post on the other thread that you shared and some of the comments were fantastic, advising you to find a lawyer and explaining step by step how much of an ADA violation this is as well as workplace retaliation and discrimination. Those are awesome. 

As a hard of hearing person, I am curious if they have provided any kind of accommodations in your classroom that may help? I am thinking... mirrors above the board and on the side of the board so you can see if a student is raising their hand when you're writing something. 

A strict policy of hand raising since you cannot follow random comments. 

I'm wondering if you would be allowed to have your phone on you and do speech to text when an incident is happening so you can have a transcript of what is said? Obviously, you will not be able to stare at your phone to keep up during the incident, but It can help when filing an incident report.   
  
I'm trying to think creatively. Obviously you won't get any fancy accommodations from admin who don't understand the nature of hearing loss. I'm just honestly stunned that a SCHOOL wouldn't provide... accommodations even for a teacher. That's wild to me. Do they have a disability services office? That's my own curious question.

They don’t even have cell phones. They do have some sort of laptop-based app. I have multiple old smartphones that I can set them up with that would work with their current wireless and for $15 we could add cellular. I see some promising apps but this seems like something I should get expert advice on. What tools have you found useful and, assuming they’re interested, what is the best way to help someone learn? I am open to paying a pro for a session or two if that would be best.  Many thanks in advance.

Check with your states agency for deaf and hard of hearing for a caption device or phone. 

Check with your fire department for smoke alarms that flash a light.

Reading a message can be challenging too, depending on their ability to process/ read quickly. Some apps retain the written msg for review. Im using CaptionCall for calls, and a transcription app for irt meetings.

Caption Call is free

Innocaption is free for deaf/ hoh 
I think you might have to enter your  SSN to register. I forgot.  Its decent sometimes hit or miss

For face to face conversations in quiet environments, the captions built into any phones accessibility menu should be good enough. Paid services like otter.ai are more accurate. 

Is this a situation where they just need a little help or do they need adult care services? In the US, they can use IP relays, VRS (if they sign), or InnoCaption free of charge to make phone calls. Having adult children in the area does not mean they are capable of living on their own.

Android or IoS?

Android use live transcribe. I have an app that's basically an improved version of that hopefully in a few days or whenever the play store approves it, too.

1o0xjgf,hardofhearing,Hearing Aids Best for Heavy Sweating?,"I am going in for a hearing aid fitting/evaluation in a couple weeks to get a new pair. I had the fancy starkeys with all the Bluetooth this and this that for about 5 years and I HATE THEM. 

This time around I want some that are absolutely NOT Bluetooth capable and do not have *any* phone connectivity and are made for people who work outside and sweat, etc a LOT.

Are there any particular ones I should be looking at and thinking about? 

[댓글]
Talk to your audiologist about that. And for hearing aids to not be connected is totally fine. your audiologist will knkw how to help for both of those concerns. Fyi

You don't need to use the Bluetooth feature. Definitely not ReSound. Phonak managed sweat better.

Some of them are waterproof, or at least rated water resistant.

When I was a kid I think sweat did in one of my BTE aids.  More recently, my old Phonak would sometimes shut off when I got very sweaty but they'd turn back on when they dried out.

My current ones (Oticon) seem completely resistant to it.  I work a job where I'm sometimes very sweaty and they're basically sitting in pools of salt water for hours behind my ears and they're fine.  I wear them at the gym, too.

I used to worry about it but I decided to just not worry about it.  They're under a fairly comprehensive warranty.

Absolutely no phone connectivity may be a tough ask.  Almost all hearing aids have a T-coil receiver even if they don't have Bluetooth.  And almost all have Bluetooth, too, these days.

This is one of the reasons I went with in the ear. They are naturally protected from sweat and don't bounce around when I'm working out. Not an option for everyone, but I greatly prefer them.

My audiologist actually said Bluetooth options tend to be more waterproof because they don’t have any access points to the battery like the ones with a physical battery do.

Ooooh so you’re switching to rechargeable?

I switched from Signia to Phonak, and I LOVE them. Withstand heavy workouts much better than Signia. You will still have to give them maintenance though and more often because of the sweat. There's truly no brands out there that are sweat proof.",2025-10-08 01:33:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0xjgf/hearing_aids_best_for_heavy_sweating/

He said it could take 12 weeks from the surgery date for my hearing to be normal, but I’m at about 15 weeks now and I’m still hearing a lot of internal noise when I open/close my jaw.

1o0s3dc,hardofhearing,New Signia hearing aids making me crazy! 😵‍💫,"I just got hearing aids for the first time. The left one, that is. I’ve always semi joked that my left ear canal was deformed because I could never get regular in-ear speakers (can’t remember actual name) to fit.

This left one will not seat properly. We’ve tried a large dome, a smaller dome, and the one you see in the picture. It’s always loosening in my ear canal, especially when I’m eating. It’s making me just crazy!!! The right ear is seated just right and doesn’t loosen at all. I need to go back to the hearing center. But first, what are your thoughts?

[댓글]
My ears are so tiny internally that they used the kids dome from a different set. Look into it!

Why not get the custom earmolds? They'll be exact to your ear canal that way

I got custom made molds. I could not stand the domes. My hearing aids are receiver in the ear too.

Maybe you and your audiologist can look into Grip Tips? I know Oticon makes a few sizes and maybe they would fit on your Signia hearing aids? I was having so many fit issues this year with my new hearing aids and this is what I landed on. They’re kind of an in-between of domes and custom ear molds. They’re almost sticky feeling and as they warm up in your ear they really grip on and don’t move around like domes do.

Molds are the way to go, as long as it's an option with that style receiver. I had a trial pair one time with domes, they would pull off the receiver and get stuck in my ear all the time. I would use this tiny pair of eyeglasses tweezers to fish them out of my ears.

I’m somewhat like that with my right. It won’t seal. I have tiny ear canals and get wax plugs easily

Audiologist here. If you were my patient I'd add a retention tail. When my patients are between sizes I go with the larger size and cut 1 or 2 slits in it to make it ""tulip"" and then you've made a dome that's between sizes. If none of that worked, we'd be talking about custom molds.

Depending on your insurance custom ear molds might be the answer for you. My ears are tiny as well and the only thing that worked for me are custom ear molds. The feedback went away when I got them.

For years my domes slipped out and I didn’t know any better.  I was told there was one size larger they could use.  When it first went inside t was a bit uncomfortable and took me about a week to get used to it.  But I now don’t have them coming out anymore.  Maybe if the kid ones don’t help you you could try this.

I suggest custom earmolds. Because they'll be custom-made to your ear, you won't have any problems.",2025-10-07 21:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0s3dc/new_signia_hearing_aids_making_me_crazy/
1o0loz4,hardofhearing,Lipreading and Auditory Training,"In 1950s, more rehabilitation was offered for hearing loss through the VA. It not only included hearing aids but auditory training and lipreading practices. In the 70s, that fell by the wayside and the focus became more about hearing technology. By the 90s, lipreading just about disappeared.

I've had hearing loss since the mid 80s and got my first pair of hearing aids in the early 90s. Back then, it was analog hearing aids and boy did I struggle with them. What I didn't know at the time was that hearing aids didn't fix my kind of hearing loss. I also didn't know about hearing aid limits back then so background noise continued to be a huge problem in my work environment. I had coworkers say things like, ""Are your ears on,"" when I couldn't understand them. Or the hated, ""Turn up your hearing aids!"" During those years, I thought something was wrong with me. 

Hearing aid limits: They work best within 6 feet. Even though they are better than ever (I love my digital hearing aids over those old analogs), it still interferers. Harsh acoustics with reverberation also impact the usefulness of hearing aids. I didn't learn that until after 17 years of hearing aid use. If I had known, I could created workarounds way back in the 90s. 

After a big drop in hearing going into the severe range (high frequency hearing loss), I had to learn to communicate all over again. I also lost my career at this point because I couldn't cope in noisy environments and there weren't as many accommodations as there are today.  

After two years of feeling like I was in a hole, I did climb out with persistence and determination. I started to teach lipreading for the D/HH state agency, among other hearing loss related classes. I found lipreading to be most helpful because it taught me how to advocate for myself and evaluate communication situations. Now I teach for [Hearing Loss LIVE!](https://hearinglosslive.com/lipreading-classes/) and I have a class this Saturday for the strategies that go with lipreading. Strategies are must because 60 to 70 percent of speech is NOT visible. We need workarounds. Lip shapes are only one of the tools of lipreading and I can teach the visible shapes too, with a class on Oct 25th.

Lipreading aside, auditory training is important too. Over two years ago, I got my first Bluetooth hearing aids. Wow! After not listening to audio books most of my life, I dipped my toe in with these hearing aids in. At first I kept the [built-in smartphone captions](https://hearinglosslive.com/smartphone-built-in-accessibility-for-hearing-loss/) on to help me with the listening. After enough practice, I was able to let go of the captions. The trick was using my hearing aid app to slide out ambient/environmental noise.  I miss words from time to time but I can usually puzzle it out at some point. After a few years of this, I realized auditory training has improved my comprehension. So there really is something to the full rehabilitation the VA offered many years ago. I highly encourage this practice now with podcasts and audiobooks if you don't already do this. Just make sure the narrators/speakers don't have an accent, they talk one at a time, have a steady pace and no background noise. I'm choosy what I listen to and it helps. 

We don't hear things like this from most hearing professionals. It comes from hardcore personal experience.  Thought I'd share a couple of tips to help. Also, use the [Three Golden Rules](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/) with everyone. That alone helped me a lot year ago when I discovered that made all the difference for me.

Great points.  I have been avoiding audiobooks but I can see the benefits uf using them.

There is no scientific proof that auditory training helps. Getting use to a CInis a different thing, with hearing aids you simply lack the input.

Lip reading might be ok for emergencies, when other options aren’t available, but I feel you should be advocating for skills that do offer us 100% of what’s said without effort, instead of 30% with a great cognitive effort. Why should we waste our cognition on just listening, instead of using it to actually process the information itself.

\-They ""stare me"" like it's being more confortable to hear me due to lip reading (without noticing?)

\-They also speak louder than other people, and when we watch tv, often ask me to higher the sound.

1o05eun,hardofhearing,how to explain my hearing to friends/classmates,"Some context to begin with, i struggle with low frequencies rather than high ones, and im on a months long wait list to see an audiologist to figure out how much hearing i have and what type of loss. My GP agrees that i have some level of loss, and that hearing aids may be helpful for me, but i dont know how bad my hearing is nor have access to aids yet. I struggle with conversations even in quiet environments unless the other person is louder, next to me, and facing me, and it has to be just the one person so i can focus on them. I only hear the higher pitched sounds of rain, and even at its heaviest rain is quiet for me. I can only really hear things comfortably when its loud, singular things to focus on, and in a quiet environment.   
I'm not even sure if its a loss at all, as my hearing has always been this way since i was  little, im now 20, but as i was neglected i never saw a doctor from what im aware of. My parents often complained about my ""selective"" hearing, and i have never really been much of an out loud talker from what i now know was social fatigue from being autistic, and listening fatigue making conversations especially difficult and taxing. I also struggle to speak in general as i trip over words, and according to my flatmate i apparently have a lisp and audibly struggle to say letters that i coincidentally also struggle to hear. I was put into a BSL club when i was a kid so i can do basic signs and fingerspelling, but we're not really sure if i was there just because it was available or if i was having visible issues or delays.  
  
I'm now finally in a college course and in a place where i have the energy for it, but im really struggling with communicating with my friends and classmates out loud. Its an art course and the majority of us are autistic/adhd, so when i explain that i cant hear very well or am hard of hearing they tend to go ""oh me too! i struggle to process words, i always go what? whenever someone is repeating what theyve said for me!"". And i get it i really do, but they arent seeming to understand that its not what i mean. And ive already noticed people looking at me funny as i assume ive missed them talking to me, or completely ignored them because ive had to focus on the lecturer speaking. So saying im hard of hearing just isnt explaining enough anymore, but i dont want to have to completely explain my experience just so people finally start speaking up to me. I've thought about saying im d/Deaf, as it has been since i was a child and i would rather use BSL if i had people that knew it, but as we dont know my level of loss yet im not sure im comfortable or right in doing so.   


It's a tough situation for me rn, but i have these classmates for at least this school year and the next, and I may not be seen by audiology until February. I'm also not sure if hearing aids would even be useful if they are offered as i expect i will be very overwhelmed with sound.",2025-10-07 04:41:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o05eun/how_to_explain_my_hearing_to_friendsclassmates/

I’m just curious has anyone that has had a BAHA had the bolt slip out before? I’ve followed all instructions. Don’t touch it etc so I’m quite baffled at how it has just quite literally slipped out. My panic is that this will happen again.

That reminds me of the Babblefish from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Overall your idea and concept sound interesting.

Depending on your plot and world building, think about what getting used to having a dragonsnail in your ears be like. Is that something youd like to explore? Is being hard of hearing something you'd like to address plot wise? Is it considered a disability in the world? or how does each tribe and nation views your character due to his hearing loss? What kind of limitations does having dragonsnail aids and what positive attributes does it provide your character?

There's so much you can come up with and so much to think about, but it all depends on what story you're trying to tell.

I do like how it looks but I think I’d rather see something that looks more realistic. Or if a younger kid was reading it they might get excited to see something they’re wearing too. 

Either way works though! We need more representation.

Hiya - hearing aids shouldn’t cover up the whole ear. 

It’s not like a headphone for listening to music. 

Every person experiences hearing loss differently- their ear has very specific abilities to “funnel” the sound into your head. 

Try having your shell design off the ear - check out Cocher Implants.

I love the whole idea. Everything of it. And exactly as it is. Don’t change anything. I think real world issues with real hearing aids just do not apply in this context. Just point out the positive. I‘m pretty sure both Deaf and hearing kids will love the idea.

The only thing I would ask myself: If it is symbiotic, what do the snails get out of it? But you‘re a writer, so you‘ll figure it out. The reason could just lie in the past or is a reward for being a true dragon friend or that dragon snails just need trust, closeness, warmth and words to live. And they could go on a „walk“ and grass a bit nearby, when they feel the hero has fallen asleep (my first words in the morning would probably be: „Where are my snails???“ 😀).

By the way, I don‘t know if you are familiar with the process of being fitted with hearing aids. But when you get ear moulds (the part that sits in the ear), an impression is taken by squeezing a goo-ish (silicon-like) mass into your ear canal, which then expands and fills every corner of your ear canal. It feels exactly like a snail crawling into your ear (at least I guess that‘s what it would feel like).

Good luck with the story!

Greetings from Hamburg

If you need any assistance with describing how it may feel having that parasite in an ear, the Animorphs series from the 90s has a lot of descriptions because the antagonists are slug aliens that live in your ear/brain. 

I'd definitely consider what type of loss he has as that would help describe the functionality of the ""aids"" so to speak.

I dont have anything to add that wasnt already said above, but id just like to say i love this idea! Im both hard of hearing and an artist/designer, and this scratches such an itch for representation in media! Its inspiring me to wanna create my own hoh character &lt;33

I like the design, looks like a cochlea (look it up, huge part of inner ear) :))

1nxagy0,hardofhearing,I think I have hearing loss and I don't know who to ask (?,"the context:

about a month ago I bought a pair of Focal Bathys and I've started to notice something weird. Voices always sound louder/clearer on the right side, and I don't really hear them centered in my head. It feels like they're shifted to the right. On top of that, sometimes I get this kind of ""empty"" sensation in my left ear, almost like something's blocking it a bit.

I thought it might be the headphones, but when I flipped them around (right cup on left ear and vice versa), the voices actually sounded perfectly centered again.

so could this actually be hearing loss in my left ear? I notice the same thing when listening to voice messages too weird thing is, with in-ear headphones I don't really have this issue, maybe because they go directly into the ear, idk.

Also, in the channel balance I now have it slightly further to the left so I can hear the singer's voice centered in my head.

Can anyone suggest something to me? I doubt a Focal Bathys would come damaged lol

An audiologist assess hearing that’s who you have to ask.

Just go to an audiologist. I have progressive hearing loss and I am now a bit hyper vigilant about losing hearing. Differences when listening to music has always been a big indicator for me. The audiology test is usually around $100-150.

Hear in Canada, audiologists that sell HAs usually offer a free hearing test to bring people into the office.  Check to see if they do that where you live.  Most here also let you try out new ones risk free for a while, you can return them without an obligation.",2025-10-03 20:37:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nxagy0/i_think_i_have_hearing_loss_and_i_dont_know_who/
1nwalxg,hardofhearing,Dealing with fluctuating hearing loss,"So I, 20F, have been dealing with fluctuating hearing loss for around a year. For some backstory, I have an autoimmune disease that can lead to fluctuating hearing loss that flares up relatively frequently as well as autism with an auditory processing disorder. 

I have had 3 audiograms all with different results. One was at the end of a flare and showed conductive hearing loss, the 2nd was in the middle of one and showed mixed hearing loss so I got hearing aids, and the 3rd was between flares when I felt pretty good and it was normal. My audiologist told me to keep using my hearing aids when I need them but for some reason, I feel like a scam artist or something. Maybe it’s years of medical trauma but I feel like I’m making up my own hearing loss and don’t know if I can truly claim it or not.

Sometimes I can hear practically everything and other days I mostly just hear my own tinnitus. I’ve been struggling to figure out if I should learn ASL or just keep trudging through and hope my hearing doesn’t get worse. I’m also afraid that if I did learn ASL, I wouldn’t really need it? Even though I do struggle to hold conversation half the time.

Everything feels rather stressful when it comes to my hearing and I wish I felt like I had community where I am but I don’t.

“I’ve been struggling to figure out if I should learn asl or keep trudging through and hope my hearing doesn’t get worse” you originally said you have fluctuating hearing loss which means it’s going to get worse.

In your place I’d learn ASL as a “just in case”. You never know if your autoimmune disease will permanently effect your hearing one day so it makes sense to be ready",2025-10-02 17:44:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nwalxg/dealing_with_fluctuating_hearing_loss/

Check in to the lions club foundation, starkey hearing foundation and Google search your state hearing aid grant programs.

Can also search device reutilization programs in your state. They tend to lean towards things like walkers and wheelchairs but if they don’t have hearing aids can possibly point you towards who might.

You should google organisations in your area that may be able to help

I hope you find a program to help you.  They certainly are expensive.  A slightly more affordable option may be going through Costco.  I paid about $1600 a year ago for the set.  I have moderate to severe hearing loss.  I know that’s still a lot of money but it may be more affordable than some other places.

Someone has already mentioned the Lions Club, but I want to second that. My friend donated her mom's hearing aids to them. 

Of course it's completely fucked up that Medicare won't cover hearing aids, as they are not a luxury item.

My mother got hearing aids from Costco for $1,500.

not sure about how to get hearing aids, but there are other free ways to help, such as signing! sometimes accommodating is cheaper than “fixing”

Look up the disability services in your state ( assuming you live in USA) 

They are often referred as voc rehab or disability services .. each state has it called something else. You can also contact the deaf schools to see if they have any resources that she could look into...


 If she qualifies they the state will pay if not she is back at square one.

Many HA businesses where I live donate older HAs to charities/organizations that redistribute them to people in need.   Check with local audiologists to see where they donate them to, and then contact those charities. 

Good luck.

You might want to look into OTC hearing aids. Some actually work fine for moderate loss. My mom uses a pair from audien hearing and they work perfectly well. They have FDA-registered models starting at around $200. Pretty basic but way better than nothing.",2025-09-30 17:01:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nuiqod/please_advise/

In November I'm going to ger Costco hearing aids and I think that will help but does anyone have advice about how to talk to my (again highly emotionally sensitive) son about this?

""hey, kiddo. I've noticed that my hearing is really frustrating you. If I'm honest, my hearing frustrates me sometimes, too.

I love you so much and I don't want you to ever think that you are not important to me. I'm gonna try some hearing aids to see if I can try to meet you halfway, here. 

Does this make sense to you, kiddo?""

Just insert whatever real life details make sense for you in the brackets. 
Remember that tone and facial expression are gonna be really important with emotionally sensitive people. You got a emphasize that it US vs THE PROBLEM. Not you vs your kid.

Don't be defensive. Just let him talk. And keep in mind he is getting closer to puberty, so that is a lot of mental and emotional growth on his end along with the physical. He will be very tender and sensitive about everything.  

It's really important to give him the safe places where he can let out his hot air and know that yes the and you can't change the hearing loss but he knows and you know that within each other there is safety. And no defensiveness going on.

1ntyv8h,hardofhearing,audiogram advice for low frequency struggles,"Update: turns out the place i was going to get my hearing tested wont let me as im too young, apparently unless its age related it \*has\* to be investigated by the nhs first according to the email i got, which makes sense i would want a doctor to properly investigate instead of just prescribing aids, but i was always planning on getting the basic test done at this place while i wait for an nhs appointment. Unfortunately I may be waiting up to 18 weeks simply for the assessment, and i am seriously struggling in my college now

\----

So i finally got my hearing test booked for the end of this week, and i am so nervous  
my last one was back in march and it came back normal despite obvious struggles, and we've determined it was the audiologist that i saw not doing in depth enough testing and only looking for high frequency loss (which i think is fairly mild for me now but may have been normal at the time)  
i have since gotten worse, i think losing some high frequencies may have made the lost low ones way more obvious, and im seeing a different free provider while im waiting on a referral to the nhs services so it should hopefully go better  
i am going to make sure i mention this to them, but im also wondering if i can ask for a ""reset"" inbetween tones during the beep test, as after a couple tones my tinnitus ends up getting louder and louder until its louder than the test itself, i end up hearing phantom versions of the actual tones that ive already heard, and its very dizzying so i think i need many breaks where i hear something normal inbetween to get accurate results?  
i am very nervous that i wont see a good audiologist again that wont test for low tones, is there anything else i could say or do to potentially make this a little easier?

My test done by the nhs covered ranges from 250hz to 8khz. Your audiologist should ask if you have tinnitus before they start if they don’t then tell them.

1ntqi8i,hardofhearing,Anticipating Dinner Table Syndrome- Advice?,"For those unfamiliar- Dinner Table Syndrome is the experience of being left out (intentionally or unintentionally) of conversation because of hearing issues (and/or lack of access such as sign language use). Usually, at the dinner table, but I'm sure all of us have experienced it in many places. 

I'm going to a small event in a few hours, and already know this is going to be an issue. It's sounding like it'll be 10-ish people, and exactly 2 of them ever bother to include me in the conversation in any way. 

It's my brother-in-law's birthday dinner, at a restaurant I can't even eat at, and my husband and father-in-law are the ones who generally make an effort to include me. I'm only hoping I'll be able to sit near enough to FIL for that much to even be an option. 

Does anyone have any advice? I truly can't explain why I continue bothering to go to these things, but somehow I guess I've decided to go. Thanks in advance. 

[댓글]
Tell your father in law ahead of time that you'd love to sit with him at dinner, save you a seat so you can catch up.

I suggest using the wireless microphone (tiny device, not the karaoke microphone lol)  that connects to your phone via Bluetooth. Use the caption app on your phone and the mic should be able to pick up the sounds and spell out words. I have an IPhone 16 and it comes with built in caption.

Oh this is probably the reason I end up drinking more than I should at these type of things !

When I’m in this situation, I do my best to follow the mannerisms of everyone else at the table (laughing when they laugh, for instance) and get real comfortable with the fact that I’ll have hardly a clue what the plot of the conversation is lol. 

It’s exhausting trying to make hearing people consider me and I’d rather occasionally feel left out than intentionally ignored.

I relate to this so hard. I have multiple food allergies, so I can't eat at many restaurants, so I go to hang out, but then I can't hear anyone. I'm not much help, but just know you aren't alone in this. Most of the time at restaurants I just sit there looking around or honestly, I sit next to the kids if there are any. They dont care as much if I need them to repeat themselves and I can just have silly little conversations with them so it doesnt mind if I miss something and sound a little goofy.

1ntkwma,hardofhearing,Jabra Disabled My Hearing Aids Remotely Without Warning,"I bought a pair of Jabra Enhance 500 hearing aids in late July for $2,100, financed through Bread Payments. Two weeks later, they went on sale for $300 off, and Jabra refunded me that amount after I asked. But then, without explanation, they refunded another $1,400. I kept making payments, never knowing the balance was lower.

A few weeks later, I got a call from someone at Jabra named Morgan, who said they’d accidentally refunded the full amount (they didn't) and I’d need to return the hearing aids. She promised a deep discount on a new pair, including the new 700 model, and said I’d receive the replacements *before* sending mine back. That never happened. I'm still making payments to Bread. Most recently, today.

Then, this past Friday at 5 PM, Jabra remotely disabled my hearing aids. No warning. They stopped pairing with the app, lost their programming, and I was left in silence. I had no idea remote deactivation was even possible. I’ve become really dependent on them, and losing access like that was jarring and isolating.

I called customer service this morning and was told it could take up to five business days for a manager to respond. Meanwhile, I’m stuck without hearing support because of a refund error I didn’t cause, and a promise that was never kept.

I’m sharing this because I think it’s important for others to know that remote disablement is a thing. These aren’t luxury items. They’re medical devices. If a company can cut off your access without notice, that’s a serious ethical issue.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I’d love to hear how you handled it or if you have advice on how to escalate it.

[댓글]
I'm very surprised about the since the FDA regulates medical devices to ensure safety and effectiveness. 

If Jabra did this, that would mean they did a post sale modification without a medical or safety justification and that is a very good way to get the FDA's attention.

Not only that, I can think of four different ways a lawyer would take on this, depending on the contract and finance agreements...

Breach of contract, breach of warranty, violation of customer protection statutes, tortious interference with property and even if the contracts do include clauses, I can see the courts taking a dim view on this.

but I'm layman and I'd double check with a qualified professional on that aspect.

Wow. That is some bullsh!t.

I believe GN Resound owns the Jabra brand. Let them know about this.

This is dystopian

Very black mirror like! How horrible, I still don't understand why they view hearing aids as cosmetic....like, I can't hear without them? 😢🫠

contact your state attorney general’s office.

So that's why hearing aids went digital, it wasn't because they are better, it was so they can control them from their computer.

I wonder whether there is any civil rights organisation that would be interested in taking this on as a case. Aside from the fact that it was their mistake not yours which caused this, it is absolutely disgusting that a company would just turn somebody's hearing aids off without knowing what is going on in their life. You could be having a medical emergency, giving birth, right in the middle of something absolutely critical... this is beyond vile.

You definitely need to first discuss about your question with your audiologist and the medical team that knows well about the mentioned surgery.

I have literally never communicated with \*anyone\* who I can relate to about this stuff.

I had chronic ear infections for the first 5 years of life, when I was 6, I contracted meningitis, and was diagnosed as deaf 1 year later. It sounds unbelievable to say that \*no adults noticed that I was deaf for a YEAR\* but that's really what happened (to say that my parents didn't have their shit together would be an understatement).

My parents immediately had me get a surgical procedure to restore some of my hearing, then I spent the rest of my childhood getting regular surgeries/tubes implanted in my ears.

It never once occurred to them to teach me ASL or to talk to anyone in the deaf community about options. Which, considering that we lived in Fremont, CA (huge deaf school/community), is absolutely bonkers to me. Just endless surgeries for me! Wheee!

I have been HoH forever, but I can read lips okayish and always just got by b/c I didn't want to deal with aides or more procedures when I turned 18 (I'm now 42). I didn't even really think much about my condition until the pandemic, when everyone was in masks, and I realized how much I had actually come to rely on reading lips. I suddenly felt like I on a deserted island or something. I still can't explain it.

Anyways, I'm in a 25-year relationship with the loudest person I know, and we have three really loud kids, lol. My friends all know about my hearing, and I am lucky to have found people who will raise their voice for me regularly.

I am honestly so lucky to have people like this; however, since 2020 I've been really aware that no matter how much they understand my situation, they have no real idea what it's like to live like this. For example, even my 'husband' and kids are still shocked when I can't hear some high-pitched sound that my car is making, or the neighbor's generator. ""No, I didn't realize the dishwasher wasn't running, because I can never hear it, anyways"" type stuff.

I'm bad company at a restaurant b/c I can't join in a conversation since I can't hear more than mumbles when I chew. I have to ask people to repeat themselves all day, every day (honestly, this must be so annoying to them). The amount of times that I have just smiled and nodded at who knows what-- omg. Anyways.

I'm just sharing because, well, I've never had anyone to share this with. It's nice not to feel like an odd-woman-out for a change.

If anyone in here has any experience with OTC hearing aids I would love to know how they worked for you. Thanks for taking the time. &lt;3

\*\*\*edit to ask--&gt; How many of you hear constant ringing/whooshing sounds? 

2nd edit--&gt; Thank you to everyone who responded. I am both so touched by your kindness and completely shocked that I went this long without knowing about some of the devices you mentioned. I'm really excited to try some of these things!

This is basically my life, parents included. You're not alone.

Regarding OTC Hearing Aids, they're touch and go for me, none of them really helping a whole lot, but I use them just for that extra bit even if it's minimal at best. I work with speech therapist on various methods especially to help me in group settings and loud environments and I even bought those digital transcription glasses. I'll take anything to help me.

My advice would be talk to your ENT, if not OTC maybe they have access to some top of the line hearing aids that could actually help. I would, but I can't afford those at this moment.

In addition, I whole heartedly recommend speech therapy and individual therapist that specializes with deaf and HoH people to work through your hearing issues that definitely come from not being able to communicate correctly. They can help you build a healthier pattern of communication and advocating for yourself when everyone around you are hearing.

Hope this helps.

Welcome! Might wanna look into a table mic (paired to hearing aids) for restaurants btw. My partner and I hardly go out to eat anymore bc of noise (and I like to cook and it saves us money), but I know your situation may be different.

Hello! HoH here 45f,  I've been using hearing aids for about 20 years and looking at having cochlears done next year. I don't know about where you are, but here in Australia I wouldn't bother with the equivalent of OTC. I tried it and then ended up having to fork out more for new ones a year or two later because there were nothing but problems, but I may have been unlucky. I currently have phonek audeo aids and I love them! I also use a mic called Roger On that is pretty good for noisy situations, not perfect, but damn better than without it. I've seen the caption glasses but so far a bit out of my price range for what they can do, I'm going to let the tech advance a bit then look at it again once I'm settled with my cochlears. 

It's expensive being HoH isn't it! 

Yep I've tinnitus as well, the ringing in the ears, I do find my hearing aids help slightly with that but it's still damn annoying!

Greetings fellow human. I am here and I can’t hear. (but I can read just fine lol) It’s nice to make your acquaintance.

i’d love to pm you, i don’t mind making new friends and no one needs to be alone!!!! my dad lied and kept mine a secret and told folks i passed, i found out as an adult im  hoh and went back into my medical files - and voila i went to my first deaf social this week and it was soooo iverwhelming but im learning and made new friends!!!!

Welcome!  
Your story sounds similar to mine - 

I got hearing aids when I was 30 - most of my life family thought I was quiet 

Hearing aids have made a significant improvement to my life and relationships

Do you have tinnitus?

Constant tinnitus in F major. Get's louder  than the external sounds around me. Wheeee!

Edit: typos

Yeah, I recently found out that I've likely had hearing lost my whole life. We had several family members that grew up hard a hearing, and they never were told to even look into sign language. Apparently It's common for resources to not be talked about.
Sad because so many of us out there struggling and really could have benefited from learning this stuff earlier.

Glad you found community, OP. 

  
Also, shout out to all the LOUD family members/friends! :)

Roger On...?
HOH socials..?
Captiva...?

That's three eye openers today, thanks..

I could have written your post, minus the meningitis. 

I, too, had no idea I was lip reading so much until Covid! I had to start paying more attention to eyes and body language. 

I briefly met two deaf women while I was growing up. One knew how to lip read and it encouraged me to do it too. I wish my parents would have gotten me into ASL classes or something. It's hard to feel like I don't really belong in the Deaf community because I don't sign. I don't feel I belong in the hearing community either because they just don't understand... 

Do you do ever do this? I often watch videos on mute and read the lips of whoever I'm watching and I try to guess what their voice sounds like. Then I unmute and compare. Often times it sounds like their voice in my head. lol (OK, that sounds crazy.)

If you'd ever like an online buddy who has been thrift similar life things, feel free to reach out via DM. Would be happy to hear (ha!) from you.

I was in a somewhat similar situation (not deaf from birth, but progressive hearing loss over time), and I finally decided to try OTC hearing aids a while back. I will still stick with Nova hearing aids, as they've made it much easier for me to follow conversation without constantly asking people to repeat themselves and the background noise reduction also helps a ton in busy places.

I love my Resound hearing aids. Have you had a hearing test done by an ENT?

I have hearing aids from Costco. They’re Phillips, they pair to my phone (I can set it in front of a speaker as a mic), car, and they made a huge impact! Also I have tinnitus (the ringing!) and they actually help with that some too!

iPhones have an accessibility setting called Live Captions. It will real-time caption on your phone screen sounds from the microphone or whatever media your phone is playing. It also has an option to save captions from phone calls.  It's very easy to use and is free (with iPhone purchase of course).

I had my first ear surgery in 1969 and i am about to have my 6th in Oct 2025.

I feel you, I only just found this community too and apparently have been hoh my entire life too. Funny thing is back in my day gosh I sound old anyway they would do a hearing tests in school at the nurses office and every time the nurse would say stop faking or stop lying or stop playing a game this isn't funny or a game, they threw me into what they called the rabbit room for my entire life turns out now that I finally got it all checked out and stuff to hearing, I actually have been hard of hearing my entire life and they never cared to even check at least I found out now, now that I'm old.

[댓글]
Sounds like you're to the moderate end of it.  I remember hearing some of those things even without aids back when I had a mild loss.  

Hearing aids are information compressors.  The typical range of human hearing volume-wise is like 0 dB to 100 dB which is a factor of like ... a lot... if I recall right from math that means very loud sounds are 10,000,000,000 times more powerful than very quiet sounds.  Decibels are non-linear.

Not just the frequency but also the dynamic, the volume level, is received by the ear and processed by the brain.  And we lose so much of that with hearing aids.

The quietest softest sounds have to be smushed to fit in the decibel range that we can hear.  For me at the higher frequencies it's like this 10 dB window up at around 100 dB (very loud!).

So *screech*.  All those sounds you mention the high frequency component, when I turn my hearing aids way up, is presented to me as *screech* because *screech* is the only thing I can hear. 

I still recognize most of the sounds.  It's part of why I don't usually identify as deaf. I have a brain that's wired for sound.  Like I was shaving the other day with my hearing aids in.  (I don't normally.)  I guess I was hearing shaving for the first  time in a long time, probably since I was a young man, and there's this uniquely hoarse gritty raspy *scrape* sound.  And it didn't even startle me it was implicitly familiar as the sound of hair being cut by a razor.  I remembered it and it was comforting!   But it also sounded a bit wrong, too harsh, too loud.

Oh well.  I find with hearing aids, they make me aware of things like someone knocking or even just talking outside in the hall -- better than for a lot of hearing people with good hearing.  But only in terms of detecting noises and hearing in real silence from a distance.  And only when I have them cranked up louder than I find pleasant.

Mixed bag.  The world is so loud!  You forget.   But not completely.  It comes back quick.",2025-09-28 12:18:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nsmw0b/realising_these_things_make_sound/
1ns3bxo,hardofhearing,Very thin ear drum,"Hi, interested to hear of any experiences from people who have a very thin ear drum. Used to have ear problems as a kid only in my left and I've just started the gym and when I lift weights pressure builds in my ear like I'm on a plane.

I had it syringed a few years ago and the nurse was shocked that I'm not in pain and said that if she knew my eardrum was so thin she would never have syringed it. Apparently it's that thin they only way she could see if was there was that she could see some of the blood vessels but could actually see straight through it and all the little bones etc that you wouldn't normally be able to see. My other ear is normal.

Apart from this pressure problem I've started to get I also suffer from vertigo at random but it can be quite bad. I'm guessing there's no cure for something like this but I've wondered if anyone has something similar and has any suggestions on what helps?

1nrbp9s,hardofhearing,I built this app for my HoH partner.,"My partner is HoH and struggles in certain situations where someone is not speaking loud enough or next to her.

In June Apple announced new speech to text models coming in iOS 26, and I saw a chance to build something that could help. I am a software engineer, and after months of testing and refining, I just launched [Hearing Buddy](https://hearingbuddyapp.com), a real-time transcription app designed for her but hopefully useful for many.

What makes it different?

* Unlimited high quality captions are free forever. Captions should not be a luxury.
* Everything is processed on-device. No data ever leaves your phone, and no recordings or transcripts are sent anywhere.
* It works completely offline after setup, so you can run it any time without worrying about limits or connection.
* Pro features include speaker detection, AI-powered summaries, and streaming captions to Mac or Apple Watch.

I built Hearing Buddy for my partner, but I want to make it better for anyone who needs it. I would love your feedback.

Here is a code for a free year of Pro if you want to try those features: **HOHBUDDIES**

Redeem here: [https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=6747363502&amp;code=HOHBUDDIES](https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=6747363502&amp;code=HOHBUDDIES)

If you are interested in beta testing new releases as they come out, please comment here and I will send you an invite to the TestFlight group. Thanks a bunch.

Feel free to also share this on r/deaftech I’m trying to collect projects like this. I love the ability to generate transcriptions locally.

Is this available for Android?

I just installed it! I can’t wait to try it out!

What a good idea.  Does it work with different accents?

I’ve been trying to develop something like this in my free time! Thank you!
Just a couple of questions:
Do you recommend getting external microphones? What is the best setup? Even in noisy situations.

Following - when I get updated to IOS 26

I would be interested but I haven’t got iOS 26 yet. Desperately looking for something to use in work and social environments, so excited to test this out

This will be fun to try.

I'm interested in betas! Thank you for making this. Very generous to offer one year free.

I really want to test this out. I work with kids and am still learning sign so an interpreter wouldn’t be beneficial for me at the moment.

I would love to be part of the TestFlight group!

omg i need this thank you!!

That is so amazing, thank you for doing this!!
Unfortunately I am an android user .. 😭💔

What is the difference between this app and Otter?

Wow awesome and thanks for the year trial. This definitely looks quite useful for me. Going to have to try it with the apple watch.

Is there a version for Android?

I tried downloading but my iOS is too old. I guess I’m gonna hafta upgrade my old phone.

Seems amazing so far! Can’t wait to try it out at work next week and see how it compares to Otter, which I am somewhat ambivalent about. Thank you!!

1nqt405,hardofhearing,Learning ASL with apps + regional signs question,"Hi everyone,
I’m HOH and live in a rural area of southern Oklahoma where there aren’t many options for in-person ASL classes. I’ve taken ASL 1 in person, then ASL 1 as a refresher and ASL 2 through the Oklahoma School for the Deaf’s website.

Lately, I’ve been using this app to keep practicing. I like that it gives me good practice tools and even has you work on making full sentences, not just single signs.

My concern is that I’ve noticed a lot of regional signs are used in my area, and I don’t want to come across as “foolish” if what I’m learning in the app doesn’t always match what people here use.

Has anyone else run into this? Do you think apps are still worth it in the long run, or should I focus on different resources? Any advice or suggestions would mean a lot ",2025-09-26 05:31:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nqt405/learning_asl_with_apps_regional_signs_question/
1nqq6n0,hardofhearing,This is so isolating,"Before my hearing aids were ruined in a car accident i still could barely hear in loud environments and people wouldn’t accommodate because they figured hearing aids magically fixed me.

Two years without them and man im still isolated. Even at work if more than one person is talking i can’t understand anyone. Im glad i like my own company but its been harder lately to deal with the isolation. Went out with an old friend and he was pretty peeved i had trouble hearing him and he had to speak up. Went out with coworkers and a lot of it was me standing in silence while they talked because they forgot i was HoH while we were out. 

Im going out with more coworkers this weekend to a sports bar and i cant be excited about it. Ugh. 

Now its like, do i get hearing aids again and have people completely give up on accommodating? The 10% of effort people could be assed to give? Ill still have loved ones snapping at me. $4,000 with insurance before. Now my insurance is worse and the one place that takes it is booked until February. 

I cant read lips or sign. Im just tired of feeling alone! This sucks hard lately and its been harder to not snap at people when they get mad that i didnt hear them the first time. Maybe it was the hearing aids? Oticons cros. I dont know. I hope youre all having a good night!

1nptgv1,hardofhearing,Married to HOH husband who won't wear hearing aids,"I'm so frustrated with this situation. My husband, who has had hearing aids for about a decade hates wearing them just won't wear them around me (he wears them all day at work). They are the kind that you can barely see - he just hates how they feel in his ears and some noises (like a dish banging) are way too piercing for him.  It took several years of arguing over him being hard of hearing and him trying to reverse it to say I am then we both got our hearing tested and lo and behold, he had significant hearing loss. I felt happy he finally got hearing aids, but irritated I had to endure being blamed for his hearing loss.

As a result of this, he will not ever wear his hearing aids at home. Obviously, this results in decreased communication between us, which is already an issue. He mumbles because it feels loud to him when he talks but gets mad at me if I ask him to repeat himself (and jumps on the opportunity to say ""you're so hard of hearing!"" when, after him getting hearing aids, I have never said such a thing to him), and of course, he has a really hard time hearing me. When he can't hear what I say, sometimes he just won't respond but I know he heard that I said something so I have to ask ""did you hear me?"" and then he gets mad. So I just always assume he didn't hear me to give him the benefit of the doubt. But when I do that and he DID hear me, he's offended.

God forbid we go out anywhere. We just don't talk at dinner. I've suggested us learning sign language, but he refuses to do this. My conclusion is just that he doesn't really WANT to hear me. On my birthday we went out to dinner and he actually wore his hearing aids and had a really nice dinner; I felt listened to and we had a nice conversation. But I don't want it to be a once a year thing.

Is this normal? Do other couples deal with this? I don't mind being married to someone hard of hearing, but I feel like he needs to come to terms with it.

1nn5jzx,hardofhearing,"Should I adapt more, or should work adapt too?","Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for some advice and outside perspective.

I’m hard of hearing (deaf in one ear, cochlear implant on the left, and a hearing aid on the right). I’ve been working at the same company for 11 years. From a technical standpoint, I believe I do well at my job—I know my craft, deliver results, and have built a lot of experience.

But I’ve consistently been told I’m “missing the leadership part.” Because of my hearing, meetings and fast-paced discussions are hard for me, and that’s often where leadership and visibility get judged. Recently, my boss suggested I should start considering another position, since my growth has been stalled and so is my salary.

So here’s my question:  
Is it fair to expect that I should completely adapt to the environment, or should it be a two-way effort where the workplace also adapts to me (with accommodations, understanding, etc.)?

I personally believe growth should be a two-party effort—but after 11 years with no real career progression, I’m questioning whether I’m being unrealistic.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

[댓글]
Where do you live? That goes a long way to determining what accommodations your employer is legally obligated to provide.

Are there any accomodations that would allow you to better participate in those meetings? If your career is stalled at this company, why not start applying to others? Unless you want this other position they're asking about.

I’m in a similar situation. I have two Roger table mics, but would need four. The responsible authority just rejected my well written application claiming that ”I should hear 15-20 people”. I asked for more interpreting (right now I get a meeting every other week or so) in December 2023, and still haven’t got it. The application system is complicated and inconvenient for the employer. Just the previous week, I faded to deal with this kind of issues:

* A big event that I actually had interpreters for was moved with short notice, and I lost the opportunity to get to know our new organisation.

* I couldn’t hear a lecture/presentation at that event, but they sent us an… untranscribed voice recording of the presentation.

* I received an uncaptioned video about our new organisation.

* we’re moving to new office space, that is more open than the one we currently have with no good options for where to place me from a hearing perspective.

* We had visitors from abroad, and I wanted interpreters for the lunch. I couldn’t get that, since our interpreters don’t do English. Normally, the booking agency contacts freelancers who are comfortable with English, but we only have a limited number of interpreters who are authorized to access our facilities.

And that’s just the last week. Of course it’s exhausting to just get somehow get the information I need for work. My team is absolutely brilliant, I have a quite good education, so I do get appreciated a lot for my work. Nonetheless, how on earth should we to actually improve communication in a way that makes a difference?

It also doesn’t help that younger generations talk so very fast.

Do you want to progress and take on more leadership?

I tried it and hated dealing with management/HR, so stepped back down to my technical role. 

Companies should accept that some people are happy in their jobs and just let them do the work. The constant need for 'more' doesn't apply to everyone.

It's been a week since I made this post and I'd like to thank all of you who took some of your time to reply to it!

I got a handful of submissions for the poll, and your answers helped a lot with some insights on the project.",2025-09-21 21:39:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nn4hsy/survey_for_graduation_project/
1nmqcdk,hardofhearing,The easiest help you can give today,"Hey everyone. First off, I'm sorry if this isn't allowed here. I'm not very versed in Reddit etiquette.

My name is Jason. I've been a carpenter for the past twelve years. I injured my back at work in August 2023 and had to get a spinal fusion. I'm just now getting back to work after blowing through my savings, dealing with complications from the surgery.

At my lowest, I met an amazing girl (Amy) who was also at her lowest. Her husband had died from ALS the year prior and her children were taken away by CPS since she is deaf and unemployed. She was left with nothing, because what was left was taken by the children's grandmother, who now has custody of the kids. 

She was born deaf in China and abandoned as a baby. She was raised in orphanages until she was adopted at the age of 6 by a woman in the US. She's a tiny 4'10"" petite girl with many stories of near abductions and... worse. She's lived a rough life, but she is absolutely amazing on some ""Hear no evil, speak no evil"" type shit. I'm doing everything I can to help her because she deserves it.

So... being deaf and only having a high school education, her options for employment are very limited. She's working with the government program to find a job, but that doesn't seem to be going too well. On top of that, her food stamps got cut. I'm currently supporting her and I can barely support myself right now.

She's incredibly talented and spends all of her free time designing clothing, crocheting, doing hair/makeup/nails, making tutorials videos and editing and uploading to all the socials. She's a hard worker, but she only has 20ish followers. She does her videos with ASL, but she never added any sound, so it would just be quiet and you'd hear a fan or the chair squeaking.

I'm trying to help her with all of this, but I'm just a dumb carpenter with like 12 friends on my socials. I don't know the first thing about gaining followers and I don't really want any... but Amy could really use some. Every follower or view she gets, she comes to me so proud to show me. In my eyes, she's incredibly talented and makes some amazing clothing. --( Possibly NSFW content)-- Check her clothes out on IG @RaverSecrets and her makeup @DeathByMakeup. She's also got TikTok and Pinterest and everything else. Search RaverSecrets and also check out her Shopify store at www.RaverSecrets.com

Please keep the comments clean. Though the clothing is risque and Amy loves modeling it, she is a very sort of sheltered girl. She doesn't do OF or anything and... well, she shows me all the creepy messages she gets from people online and it breaks my heart that she has to deal with that.

TLDR- Deaf girl needs help. Follow @RaverSecrets on Instagram. If anyone wants to collaborate or is local to the DMV, hit me up.

Jason, you’re doing a lot right already. Biggest wins for Amy will be adding captions to every video, posting short clips regularly, and tagging deaf/ASL creator communities so her stuff reaches the right people. Protect both of your boundaries, keep it consistent, and let the growth come slow but steady. Respect for what you’re doing, man.",2025-09-21 12:12:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nmqcdk/the_easiest_help_you_can_give_today/
1nmdj5m,hardofhearing,I think I listen to music differently than hearing people,"Hello I wanted to make this post to see if anyone else feels this way? I am male(15), hard of hearing and whenever I listen to music I just can’t make out what the lyrics are. Recently I’ve realized it’s obviously because of my hearing loss. I’ve always connected with more instrumental music and with more of the “vibe” of a song rather than its lyrics. When I listen to music I tend to block out the lyrics and focus on the background music and the instrumental part of songs. My best friend likes to listen to more rap or songs focused around lyrics and when I listen to their songs I can’t ever really tell what is being said because it’s either to fast or the words kinda just mumble together. When I look up the lyrics and memorize them then the words start to form better in my head and I’m able to decipher what was said but without that I have no clue. So I’m just wondering if anyone else connects with more ethereal, indie, spiritual music like I do because of there hearing loss? 

[댓글]
Same, lyrics have always been pretty secondary to me.

My taste in music has definitely changed with the progression of my hearing loss. Also more into instrumental genre. Perhaps what you call ethereal is what vocal trance is to me, with lyrics but the music is what defines the listening experience, not the lyrics.

Yes I have the same problem

Yup me too, listening to music without lyrics even in my native language is hard. However, I enjoy good writing so I always listening while reading lyrics on google because spotify usually don't have the lyrics

Yeah, I’ve never paid attention to lyrics. I’m amazed that people can decipher what’s being said, but like you, I’ve met people who were equally amazed I don’t pay them any attention unless I look them up.

I do tend to listen to a lot of music from different cultures - maybe because it doesn’t bother me that I don’t understand them.

This is exactly the same for me too!

I miss the CDs that came with a lyrics sheet because I loved learning them, following along with those as a kid/ teen. I actually always loved to sing along but didn't always sing actual words for the whole song, sort of just a sound that I heard if that makes sense, I'm embarrassed now lol. I never wore my hearing aides that I was always supposed to wear, as I wasn't forced to, only asked lol. I started to wear them in my 20s. I'm now 40. And still can't really hear a lot of song lyrics. I recently discovered that on Spotify they have a lyrics section that often has the lyrics, or you can add them yourself from a website. I recently started to actually learn The Dead Kennedys lyrics and have fallen in love woth them even more.

Same here, i don’t ‘ hear’ them as part of the song, only the music, unless it’s like a really obvious and catchy chorus.

I was in my 30s before I heard the actual melody of the theme music from *The Price is Right.* Before that, I always thought the melody was in the bass guitar.

I can't hear lyrics either.

I like music that has structure that I can piece together slowly.

I'm very musical person and I can read sheet music and for classical music I will read along and sometimes I will be shocked to see there's an entire extra voice like a quiet flute or xylophone I can't hear at all.  

When I watch music be played live it's the same thing.  I'll see someone playing the flute and only then will I  become aware it's very slightly there in the background.  A hearing person could likely hear it distinctly.

I'm very fond of the music of Steve Reich.  He takes the parts of his compositions and slowly phases them between the instruments and the result is you hear all the parts of the music at different times, slowly changing over time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJWO2FQ16c (feel free to fast forward to about 5 minutes and then 20 minutes if you're the impatient type)

100% same, I never listen to lyrics and go solely on the 'vibe' from the instrumentals + melody. It's particularly funny when I send friends songs and I'm like - oh this is very soothing and mellow... and my friend goes oh its so sad didnt you hear the lyrics??? haha

I started losing my hearing around age 20 (otosclerosis). As a teen I loved lyrics, but as my hearing went the words in most sounds became jibberish and I started leaning towards instrumental music. 


I still listen to folk music and whatever songs have clear lyrics, but most song lyrics are mutilated by my bad hearing and my brain mishearing.

I quit listening to music for several years after I lost part of my hearing because I couldn’t make out the lyrics. About ten years ago, I finally realized I can listen to the music that the words make just like any other musical instrument. 

It was fun trying to guess what the lyrics were. Huey Lewis’ “It’s Hip to Be Square” came through as “If My Hips Could Be Square”.

After all, I enjoy classical music, and opera, even though I don’t understand Italian!

Slightly different experience, but what you said about reading the lyrics and listening to words reminded me. I have had progressive hearing loss due to Meniere's disease, but each time I lose hearing I go back and listen to a playlist of familiar music. Each time I have relearn how words and sounds sound again, and I use familiar songs to do that. Often after an episode of hearing loss I will only be able to pick the song after it's about a third of the way through, like when the chorus kicks in, and then I will tune into it and use my memory to help remap the sounds and words. That said, as my hearing loss has progressed, there are songs that simply don't sound as good anymore. The high frequency samples are gone, or it just sounds flat and disappointing, because I can remember the richness of the sounds that used to be there. So when I lost more hearing in June this year, I immediately asked my partner to buy a subwoofer for our bedroom. We have a 36"" subwoofer in our lounge room, and now I wanted a small sub for the bedroom. If I couldn't hear the high frequencies anymore, at least I can FEEL soul crushing bass, and that can't be taken away !

1nm9nrw,hardofhearing,new iOS 26 captions engine,"A few months ago Apple announced new SpeechAnalyzer API to replace SFSpeechRecognizer that launched in iOS 10.

I'm hearing, but my partner is HoH and so I immediately began playing around with the new API on iOS 26 dev beta. The difference was staggering just using the built in phone mic, and picking up correct words from distance seemed vastly improved. It's all on device as well. I built an app using the new API for my partner and she finds it actually useful now.

I wanted to do a simple side by side test so used this same short audio passage on both phones:

&gt;*“The stale smell of old beer lingers. It takes heat to bring out the odor. A cold dip restores health and zest. A salt pickle tastes fine with ham. Tacos al pastor are my favorite. A zestful food is the hot cross bun.”*

[Top: iOS 26 on left \(iPhone 16 Pro\) vs iOS 18 \(SE 2\). Bottom: My app \(Hearing Buddy\) using new API.](https://preview.redd.it/ga0l1n9cwdqf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a60e641925dcb71c89a683b377b6c1f1011858)

iOS 26 got it 100% correct, while the older model on iOS 18 had only a \~74.4% accuracy.

If anyone is using a paid captions app, you might find this new default free model from Apple is just as good now as the ""pro captions"" offered from those apps.

I can't say everything in 26 is an upgrade, the new glass UI takes some getting used too for sure, but this seems like a clear improvement.

1nm1959,hardofhearing,Is not getting a hearing aid if you're HOH in only one ear really that bad?,"I've (F 57) recently been diagnosed with “mild-to-moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss”, so I'm half deaf in one ear. 
I have heard it is important to not delay getting hearing aids for        
— the social reasons:  not avoiding activities, not being socially isolated, being able to follow conversations, etc        
— and the brain reasons: keeping the neurones which would receive the signals from the ear stimulated so they don't atrophy or get reallocated,  keeping the brain stimulated in general, thus reducing the chance of cognitive decay and dementia. The lack of social interaction is also a factor in this. 

Well that's what my audiologist says and what I have read online about getting two hearing aids. 

(As is probably obvious by now I'm not an audiologist or other health professional. Apologies if I've used incorrect terminology.)

I have found it difficult to find anything online from a reputable site about the consequences of delaying or not getting a hearing aid when the only significant hearing loss is in one ear for an adult. Almost everything online is about both ears or about children or babies. 

I mentioned my condition and my plan to get a hearing aid to an aunt, Helen (F 82, no blood relation) who has been partly deaf in one ear most of her adult life but never got hearing aids.  She said that the only reason for cognitive delay was missing out of social interaction, rather than the brain not getting stimulated by signals from the affected ear. She also said that since I had one good ear than I'd be fine. 

Hmm. Did what Helen say make any sense?  I suspect her view is based on cognitive dissonance becaise she never got a hearing aid herself. 

Does anyone have any information specifically on the risks of delaying getting a hearing aid when you only have one ear affected?

I have perfect hearing in one ear and moderate to severe hearing loss in the other, getting a hearing aid has helped me thus far. Got one in July. I can definitely tell a big difference when its in or not.

Hearing in stereo is important to me.
It drives me nuts when my name is called and I can't tell by the sound which way to turn.

It made a huge difference for me. I have slight hearing loss in one ear and was mostly deaf in the other (I had surgery to correct it this year). I had to save to buy myself a hearing aid because insurance wouldn't cover the cost since I could still hear fine on one side. About 5 years after I was told I qualified for a hearing aid I finally got one. It wasn't perfect, but I hadn't realized how much I was missing. 


It took a while for me to relearn how to hear on my bad side. It was mentally exhausting and took me a few weeks to adjust to wearing the hearing aid all day without feeling overwhelmed.  Once I adjusted I was very glad to have  better hearing.

No, it‘s not.

If you want to, you can try a hearing aid and see for yourself, if it provides any acoustic advantage for you in daily listening environments. I would even recommend to try one. But if you don‘t want to, that‘s absolutely fine and no risk factor for dementia whatsoever.

I have profound loss in one ear, nearly perfect hearing in the other. I’ve been hard of hearing since 18 months old. I didn’t get hearing aids until my mid 20s and I personally love them. I use a CROS system.

Because of the type of hearing loss I have, my only option for hearing aids was the bone implanted one. I couldn't accept an unnecessary surgery, nor the potential side effects such as my body rejecting the implant. So I choose to live with my deaf ear, and do my best to protect what hearing I have left in my good one. 

I am of the opinion that hearing aids are a personal choice. If you choose to wear them, that's awesome. If you don't, then that's just fine too. I don't have much information about the medical risks of foregoing the hearing aid, unfortunately. But everything in life comes with a risk and we must choose which risks are worth it for ourselves.

Similar situation 47F hoh on one side, no loss on the other. ENT suggested ot was important to get a hearing aid so the ear keeps getting input..i have otosclerosis so maybe that matters. But honestly the little annoyance of the aid is worth it to just hear normally.

It’s never bad to not get a hearing aid.

I needed new hearing aids this year. I actually considered only getting one because I couldn’t hear anything with one ear. So why spend money on two aids if only one helped. My new audiologist told me she could get that ear to hear. She was right! I can actually hear with both ears now. I was and still am amazed.",2025-09-20 15:32:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nm1959/is_not_getting_a_hearing_aid_if_youre_hoh_in_only/

1nlhbl2,hardofhearing,Volume Control,"Volume Control

I (31f) had a translab surgery for an acoustic neuroma back in 2023 which caused me to permanently lose half of my hearing. Since then I've struggled with volume control. I'm always too loud. I've always been a relatively louder person as I came from a loud family and so did my husband, but since my surgery I get told I'm yelling a lot, especially if I'm excited or passionate about something.

How have those of you who are missing half or all of your hearing worked on your volume control so you're not yelling?

TIA 😊

I definitely make a point to work on volume control so that I don't talk loud. Everyone says hard of hearing people talk loud and I don't want to be guilty of that.

People usually will tell me if I'm too loud. I have no hearing in my right ear. I can hear out my left, but it isn't noticeable until I don't catch what was said",2025-09-19 22:24:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nlhbl2/volume_control/

I rely on captions apps for school and work. Accuracy of the captions is proportional to the quality of the microphone and internet connection. It also depends on a favorable environment without background noise. The “real time” is a 3-10 second delay.

The cost isn’t scam level like Hearview, but I wonder how cheap it could be without the Ray-Ban name.

It should be mentioned that it only aids in communication one way. It gives the impression that what hearing people have to say is more important than Deaf voices.

Overall, they can be a helpful tool in the right situations, but they are far from giving actual accessibility.

Considering how poorly it performed during the demo I wouldn't hold my breath. Meta isn't good at making products, only buying already successful ones.

The limiting factor is typically the size/positioning of the (wearable) mic tbh. The tech has been there for years on the software end. There's a reason lapel, boom and shotgun mics are still used in film and tv. It's not because people enjoy holding something 6 inches above people's heads or people enjoy getting wired up.

Source: About to ship a STT app mainly using the same libraries Live Transcribe uses. Also was a musician.

I keep seeing so many different caption-glasses advertised lately. I want it it to be a thing, but just cant imagine its particularly good in the environments you actually need them in. Have they come a long way? Or still an overpriced gimmick for hearing people to play with?

Maybe it’ll help in 10 or so years, well after AI takes all our jobs. I don’t trust a word Zuckerberg says

I’m excited for these eventually working out the kinks; for now they seem to have the same hurdles that frustrate me with my HAs (eg tough to function in loud environments like bars and restaurants, needing to be facing the speaker for background noise reduction to really work, etc). I kind of equate them with the early days of flat screen TVs in terms of price and quality, as with time both improved. Definitely staying tuned though!

The meta glasses are nice, but only single eye and 79g is a lot for hours on end. These are our equivalent, just released, duel eye and 8 hours battery.

*I let my manager know at orientation and he said I’m fine and he will accommodate me if needed. I said I’ll let him know if I have any issues.

I worked drive through for over a decade with hearing aids. The headsets they had when I started did not play nice with the hearing aids I had at the time. It had only one headphone, so I would just take that hearing aid out and crank the headset up, which worked fine. Background noise is always going to be an issue in restaurants. Other people talking, dishes being done and getting slammed around, chatter from cooks, other registers, etc. It sounds like your aids help a lot, but there will be an adjustment period for sure til you get used to what it sounds like. Even the style of building is a factor, whether it's one of those big open rooms or just a normal height ceiling.   

I now work as tech support from home, so every day is packed full of phone calls. I found a solution with over the ear closed back headphones along with a strong headphone amp. The over ear phones don't make my hearing aids feedback, but just plugging them into the PC wasn't loud enough for me, so I started using the headphone amp which is great because I can just adjust the volume knob depending on call quality.  

I think you'll be just fine, but practice nice ways to ask people to repeat themselves, don't just say ""what?"" if you can't hear them.

I worked in retail and in a restaurant and had few issues. As long as I wasn’t making insane requests I was fine. My only limit with the restaurant was “I can’t answer phones with its loud because I’ll never be able to hear it over the customers” which was fine, I got to pick up the slack whenever it was quiet though

Congrats on your new job!! One thing I wish I did when I was younger and in my first few jobs was be transparent with my supervisor and let them know that I was HoH even if I thought I would be fine. 


I also suggest telling coworkers as needed which is what I did. Telling them I was HoH let them know “hey I’m not ignoring you” because I didn’t hear them or that my awkward laugh/chuckle was not because I’m laughing at them it’s because I probably didn’t hear what they said. 

Once I started owning my hearing loss in new environments around new people from the get-go instead of hiding it and pretending nothing was wrong (not saying you aren’t, just using my example), my confidence grew in all areas, not just working in customer service but in developing new friendships in some of those spaces as well.

Some customers are going to be dicks about you not hearing them. Hangry people tend to be ridiculous. 

I hope they won’t be able to get to you

i work in fast food too, at first i’ll admit it was harder, but i learned some things:

 1. memorize the menu board. so many times i can tell what a customer is going to order based off where on the menu they’re looking

2. talk with your hands- people are likely to mirror you, and if they see you moving your hands, they’re likely to make similar movements back. for example, when i ask “for here or for to go?”, i point to the counter/cash (here) or to the door (to go). people many times copy this, although subtle it helps so much. another example is when asking someone if they’d like a ftn drink or bottle, i’ll point to each, or when asking what size, i point to the different sizes we have and 80% of the time they’ll point to the one they’d like (works best if your store have the size options at the front counter)

3. if you’re not sure you got an order right, repeat it back to them when they’re done ordering (useful if you won’t have a screen on the other side so they can’t see) 

i doubt your store has this, but my store has a paper-sized copy of the menu for customers who can’t see very well. however, i’ll use this for when i really have a hard time understanding someone, i’ll have them point to the item they’d like and never had an issue with this

also, let your coworkers know, its important for  communication so they don’t think you’re ignoring them, or in worse case scenario they can help take the order (i’ve only had to do this once or twice, when someone had a thick, heavy accent) and all my coworkers were understanding

 lastly, advocate for yourself!! if someone has a mask, i ask them to lower it down to lipread, or if they’re uncomfortable doing so i ask them to speak clearer if possible. when someone is speaking too quietly, ask them to speak up, or what i do is quite obviously turn up my hearing aids. i know its quite stressful at first, but you’ll get adjusted in no time",2025-09-17 21:58:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njqkiz/have_you_worked_in_fast_food_customer_service/

1njcjzi,hardofhearing,Hearing person here. What might make HoH people struggle with hearing aids?,"Hello! I've been reading the posts here for a while to get some perspective on a problem a family member has been having. This is a question I'm asking in hopes of understanding and seeing if there's any accomodation the family can make to help her, but I know answering these kinds of questions can be exhausting, so please pardon me if I say something insulting or insensitive.

My girlfriend has an aunt who, in her 70s, is now struggling with hearing loss. The family has been able to buy her some hearing aids, but she just doesn't wear them. When asked about them, she just says she ""forgot to charge them"", or ""forgot to wear them"". If we ask her if there's any problem with the aids she answers that ""no, they're perfect!"", but still won't use them.

That wouldn't have been a problem, except that this person already seems to struggle a bit with some form of ADHD or neurodivergence. She lives on her own and takes care of most of her business, but there have been many occasions now in which she misunderstood some crucial information, or in which people have taken advantage of her struggle to comprehend things. The family is also afraid that she's getting some dementia symptons, but at this point, they don't know if it's the age or simply that she's not hearing things right. I think she got used to ""pretending"" she's hearing stuff, because she won't tell us when she doesn't understand things. It's posible she's embarassed about it.

I thought about all of us just learning sign language (LIBRAS, the one we use in Brazil), but I know she would just refuse, saying she's ""too old"" or ""too stupid"" for that. So I was thinking if there's any other way for us to help her keep being able to communicate with friends and family without the hearing aids or the sign language?

Or, if there is no other way, is there some accomodation that might make it easier for her to wear the aids? There's clearly something bothering her about them that she doesn't want to talk about or can't even articulate; is there anything you guys have struggled with that we might help make easier for her?

I ask this because she's clearly my girlfriend's favorite aunt, and it makes her sad that it's getting harder and harder for them to communicate.

Thank you in advance for any answers, and please tell me if I said something offensive.

Imagine a genie appears before you and messes with your ears and tells you you’ve been hearing things wrong for years and this is what the world really sounds like. And then the genie stuffs things in your ears that radically alters the sound of the world. And the world is LOUD. A cacophony of things you haven’t heard before. 

Your brain goes into overdrive trying to process all this. It can be a very difficult adjustment and really needs to be done with an audiologist. It took about 2 months for me to get my current HAs dialed in the way I like them.  And there’s no real way to do it without wearing them.

I started wearing hearing aids in my mid 40’s and it was a difficult adjustment for me. I was not used to hearing so many things (birds for instance) all of the time. I could only wear them for a few hours at first because I would feel exhausted after a short time. I gradually increased the amount of time until I was able to wear them all day at work. While hearing aids absolutely do help me hear things, the sound is not natural and louder noises can be very harsh and startling. I prefer receiving information in writing rather than verbally. What about texting (especially in a difficult environment)? For medical information, I ask my doctors to provide me with written information and instructions.

So many things 
Comfort wearing may be not wanting to draw attention to them 
If she’s wearing them and having a hard time it could be environmental. Trying to listen through the din of tv sets, machines running, other sounds is very taxing and distracting. 
We just don’t plug them in and magically things are great. If I heard as well as I could see without glasses I’d be doing backflips. 
Signing is an opportunity. I have an app and see that I could learn signing. Who in the family would she be communicating with? I’m not sure what value it adds. 
Hearing aids are great for streaming on your phone or a podcast but the response of the equipment to the environment is the issue. 
Let’s say I’m in a conversation with you. As we engage, someone nearby starts talking loudly or something is making noise in the kitchen. At that time we often cannot discern what you are saying because the HA is concentrating on that louder sound. Now we can change a setting. So imagine the conversation where I ask you to wait, I pick up my iPhone and hit the app and change the settings to screen out that noise. That might take 20 seconds or more. Now, okay let’s talk. 

So how does that dynamic change without the hearing aids I’m looking right at you to read your lips and other non verbal expressions. I’m not distracted by the loudmouth nearby or the noise in the kitchen. So that’s the alternative until you say something like why aren’t you wearing your hearing aids we’d be having so much of a better convo. 
So its pretty much which version of this sucks do I want to have today?

Rechargeable hearing aids don't last long, so that is problematic for anyone that is not diligent about keeping electronics charged. It could be that a hearing aid that takes disposable batteries would be a better fit for her.


I grew up with hearing aids so I'm used to them. People new to them after a lifetime of not having anything in their ear canal often struggle with the physical discomfort. Having a mold or hearing aid lodged in the ear is unnatural. Molds can also shrink or swell depending on the season, that has been very painful for me, so much so that I had my last pair made of acrylic and that has been a huge improvement for me. Another possibility there.


Then there's the discomfort of amplified sound.


Speech comprehension is important and hearing aids help with that. What most people don't realize is hearing aids amplify a lot of other sounds too, some sounds are really obnoxious like dogs barking. Certain pitches and tones are more painful than others. Even ""silence"" is vibrating the eardrums more than usual due to amplification, think refrigerator compressor, fans or AC humming. It's easy to get fatigued. 


If this is the issue, make sure her hearing aids has a comfort in noise or comfort with speech program to dial down background sounds and ensure that she knows how to change programs.


Some people disike it so much that they don't wear the hearing aid.


And then there's the whole identity thing, not wanting to identify as a person with a disability.


So far I've mostly shared conjecture to give some perspective.


Ideally your girfriend can share her concern and desire to connect and communicate.


Let the aunt be the lead on what to do about improving communication. Your girlfriend can gently ask if that's something the aunt wants to do.


Learning sign language is a huge undertaking. Keeping expectations low on that is wise, but it could be fun and light too.


The thing to remember she probably can't function well in a group conversation. So maybe be intentional about having one on ones with her in a quiet space if speaking, or maybe switching to writing if in a noisy place or group mingling context.

From my own experience I couldn’t tolerate my hearing aids at all. My ears constantly itched I ended up with infections and the world was so loud it was painful. The whole thing was exhausting and I was glad when my audiologist and ENT said they were doing more harm than good.

I was then given an BAHA to try and whilst I loved how it helped my hearing and ability to communicate with the world. I couldn’t tolerate the soft band or sound arc they put it on for the trial. It felt like my head was constantly being squeezed. It sucked because whilst everyone involved in my care saw how amazing it was for me, that meant I couldn’t wear it for the 8hours a day 6 days a week needed to be approved for the surgery to actually place it. 

Now I have to make do without. I use a mixture of speech to text phone apps, writing / texting, lip reading and occasionally sign. I definitely think my life would be easier with hearing aids and often get frustrated but it’s not impossible to do without. It just requires a bit of a patience on everyone’s part.

There could be many reasons why they’re struggling with hearing aids, the first call should be going back to an audiologist and seeing what they advise.

i'm also a hearing person and my brother has now a cochlear implant in one side, and also had 2 hearing aids for a bit. i will only say what my experience is as a hearing person sice i am on the same side as you.

1. it's a piece of technology, it needs to be adjusted and it's only to assist your hearing. it doesn't fix it. so anything that interferes with it, batteries, etc., it's not just a permanent fix to your hearing. i think realizing that has helped me empathize with the struggle of it. obviously some people make it seamless for hearing people, but some people don't for some of the reasons you say.

2. it also depends on what type of hearing loss. some people i think may have been in war and had hearing loss, some people might have had some type of nerve damage, or neurological reason. so you don't know what the ""fix is"" or how they work. my brother's had to connect to to the nerve on the other side of his brain (i believe), to translate info to the other side of his head.. i think. basically, it's technology and you don't know how it works and it may not be perfect. 

i think that's generally how i view it. it's a tool, it's not perfect and it needs to be adjusted. so depending on the wherewithal of the person, they may use it differently and understand it differently.

i'm sure a young person who is born with some loss maybe be more in tune (pardon the pun) with it, versus someone who isn't. bassically, depending on the person, it may not be a cure-all. and they may be hiding that from you or not wanting to explain it or just not always know how to be in sync with it, or just be tired of it or just have to accept that it's not perfect. 

i think one key ive seen is the hard of hearing person has to understand how to communicate their loss to other people. but that can be daunting and exhausting because how can you, especially if it's new, or changing or just a bad day. so i think hearing people should understand that it's not always perfect, and depending on the HOH person, you have to navigate it too. 

my brother has a lot of pride so i don't know when he's just ignoring me or not telling me something on purpose, but i am learning how to empathize purely because it makes everything easier. it's a combination.

For people like your girlfriend's aunt, hearing loss was gradual, like the proverbial frog in the boiling pot. Hearing aids don't fix your hearing loss, they just amplify a lot of sounds, so when you hear then again, they don't sound right - and it's a sudden onset when you turn your hearing aids on. 

Audiologists can be kind, but they can sometimes have the attitude that you just need to sucker punch your hearing loss with the new hearing aids and get used to them, and the adjustment process can take about 2 months - and that's after you get your hearing aids to the place you want them. 

But making the adjustments takes a lot of patience and office visits, because the real world sounds nothing like the office. You get your adjustments and find out that trucks are way too loud or paper sliding on paper is too scratchy. But even when you go in, you have to be prepared to give a solid description of your issues, and audiologists don't always talk people through the ways to describe sound (tinny, scratchy, pitchy, etc.) or how to dissect where the issue might be (environmental settings, specific speech sounds, male or female voices, etc.). 

There's also a huge over reliance on tech, in my opinion. The charged battery thing is a problem for me when I fall asleep without meaning to. Hearing aids are getting ""smarter"" where they make decisions for us about what they hear and I've personally found the tech to be incredibly ineffective, to the extent that I try to get some of it disabled when I get my new hearing aids (which audiologists and hearing aid companies don't always love, so it requires a lot of self-advocacy). 

And hearing aids all sound and feel different. I switched from Oticon to Phonak and it was a horrendous change - I love my Phonaks now, but like I said, lots of visits with lots of adjustments and lots of dissecting the issues I was having. And different hearing aids have different processors, which we can't always tell but our brains know something is off.

On top of that, they can be physically uncomfortable. Had to switch temporarily to a different kind of ear mold and my ears were hot and uncomfortable to the point that I was feeling like I was going to blister. My ears adjusted though, so it ended up being fine, but .. it gave me a new appreciation for why people might avoid them. 

So, patience is key. Ask her what she needs to feel more comfortable wearing them. Maybe she'd prefer to start out in smaller settings with fewer people in quiet rooms. Maybe she needs a mobile charger. Maybe she needs more support getting to the audiologist for adjustments. And if that's the case, make it more like a ""what do you say we make an appointment and do something nice before/after?"" So it's her decision, but she's not asking, and it can be a bonding activity. Maybe a couple of trusted close friends/family could offer to be with her while she uses them so they can help her identify things that don't sound right so she can take notes to the audiologist. I've literally used the notes app on my phone with exhaustive lists of things to fix. At one point, I got my audiologist's email address so I could send her the list in advance and we could make the most of my appointment time. 

This is a sweet question and I appreciate you asking. It sounds like she has a lot of people on her side. 😊

So kind of you to be concerned about your girlfriend's aunt, and to try to understand more about how she might be helped.

I haven't read every comment but there's a lot of great explanations here. Two things that I believe haven't been mentioned:

First, there is a difference between hearing and comprehending/processing/decoding.  They are connected but separate capacities. You can hear without understanding.  If you receive all the input but your brain can't make sense of it, or has to work really hard to make sense of it, it can be overwhelming and even painful.  It can just sound like a lot of noise. Processing/decoding can erode over time with hearing loss, which is one of the hypotheses about how/why it is linked to dementia.  

Second, you say she ""pretends"" she hears stuff, but it is quite likely that she is not pretending, she truly believes she has heard what was said correctly. She is just mistaken. The brain will ""fill in the gaps"" for you (for instance, with pattern recognition -- think about how many of our daily interactions are quite formulaic and how it would be fairly easy to ""guess"" what a next word was/was likely to be in most interactions) without you even being conscious of it (this is especially true with gradual hearing loss or loss in only certain registers), and it is very difficult to distinguish between what you actually ""heard"" and how your brain understood it.  This is just something to be aware of, as she is likely not even fully aware of the extent to which her brain is using other capabilities and NOT her hearing for communication comprehension.

One last thing, I think most people, even those who are HoH, don't fully understand/grasp all the nuances of this experience, as discussed here.  I wonder if it might be helpful to translate some of this for her and she could read about other peoples' experiences with being HoH? She might recognize some of her own experiences and be more open to exploring how to get support so she has a better quality of life, that bettering her hearing is possible.

Oh man I'm early 40s and when I got my hearing aids I had to regularly leave rooms because cups were set down on the counter too loud, etc. Once my brain adjusted, it became annoying to wear glasses and hearing aids because then the outside of my ears would hurt. My long hair rubs against the microphones which is LOUD so I have to wear my hair up. If I want to lean against the couch or lie down, they pinch my ears and I have to take them out. At the end of the work day my ears are aching from them so I rarely wear them at home. It drives my husband crazy. They are a godsend for hearing but a constant physical annoyance.

Outstanding that you are trying to understand what/how hearing aids affects hoh. I started losing my hearing only 10 years ago, 5 years ago, my left ear was profoundly deaf and the right moderately deaf. I started using hearing aids about a year earlier. In 2020, I went with a cros and that help…but started really understanding that hearing aids lack so much. Everything was amplified, ok I could turn things down. Oh now I can’t hear certain sounds..look up the speech banana. My hearing lost certain range so I could hear partial words…certain sounds had been lost to me. So, hearing aids cannot replace certain sounds and things become gibberish.

I headed to lip reading, better hearing aids and finally a cochlear implant. Lip reading helps a lot, but you have to realize, you then can hear what you can see..hmm another issue to overcome.

Restaurants and groups are difficult because everything is amplified and depending on the type of hearing loss, the gibberish is multiplied. Even more frustrated.

Hearing then becomes work, work leads to fatigue. Add in the frustration…it’s incredibly challenging!

Bless you for working with her to help. You are amazing to do so. Many just walk away…

Maybe it’s the wrong hearing aids? I’ve had….hmmm maybe 4 or 5 pairs in 15 years. The first pair I still struggled to hear. It was like I was in a barrel. The sound wasn’t very good. The next pair were amplifiers. They made sounds sound unnatural. My voice echoy and loud. Claps, doors closing, all that was loud and unnatural. (I woke up deaf so I know how things should hear). I went to oticon opn next and they were my faves. But then the one died and they refused to fix them because they knew they’d get more money selling me other ones. I tried 8 different kinds of phonak because that’s the ones the lady I was seeing liked. She refused to let me try oticon until I had tried all the phonak ones and they didn’t work at all for me. Like, I couldn’t hear anything out of them. So, finally, I picked a new oticon pair. They immediately worked. They are the most natural sounding hearing aids (I mean the entire brand, oticon) that I’ve ever tried and they are my favourite kind. However, I’d still prefer the discontinued one. 

Sorry for the long story, but maybe she has the wrong type and she doesn’t like them? Maybe she wants something louder? Maybe she wants something more natural hearing? 

Also hearing loss, for extended periods of time, changes your brain. I stumble on words when I read out loud now. I have trouble telling the difference between similar sounding words. (You say why do you care and I can hear why do you bear, as an example). And you learn how to tune things out. You learn how to not listen because you’re used to listening for specific things. And it’s exhausting. In crowds, groups, noisy situations. Trying to focus on people speaking instead of all the noise. It’s a lot. Mentally and physically draining. I’m 40 I needed hearing aids around 26 years old. I have become so isolated and sad. It’s a tough life. 

Maybe ask her 

Do you want more natural sounding hearing aids 

Is there an echo

Do they hurt your ears 

Can you hear ok when you use them or are they too loud 

Have her set an alarm for the same time every day to remind her to use them. If she uses a cell phone often, set it there. Or have her write it down somewhere she can see it and set an alarm for when to take them out and charge them. Ask her if she wants to go back to the specialist and have moulds made (if she’s using the domes) because they can be more comfortable and have more hearing capabilities. Ask if they hurt her ears. Make her ears itchy. There’s always a solution, you just need to find the actual problem.

Along with what everyone else has mentioned here, your girlfriend's aunt might also be struggling with the way hearing aids distort the sound of her own voice. When I'm wearing my aids, my voice sounds very muffled and I'm unaware of my volume. People will point out that I was too loud in an otherwise quiet situation or too soft for them to hear me. I've become much more self-conscious about speaking, which can make me feel isolated even when surrounded by people.

As someone with ADHD and autism, wearing my hearing aids can also be very overstimulating. The sound of the air conditioner never bothered me before, but now it's SO loud. When listening to music, certain instruments and pitches make my hearing aids go wild with extra noise, which ruins the experience. A full day of trying to discern human speech amongst all that other unwanted input is exhausting.

As far as alternatives if she won't wear her hearing aids, you might want to see if turning on Live Captions or other speech-to-text features on her phone might help. Or even a small notebook and pencil so people can write things down for her. Learning sign language is great, but it takes time to become conversational, and it would require enough people in the family to dedicate themselves to it--including herself--for it to be truly helpful.

I wear hearing aids and I'm autistic and ADHD. If I'm just at home, I won't wear them. Taking off my hearing aids at the end of the day is as good as taking off my bra or high heels.

Can vary person to person and depend on a couple factors. For example someone who has milder loss that went undiagnosed for most their life may find it easier to go without hearing aids because it’s what they’re use to. Sensory issues and technical problems also play a part. Overall it would be better to ask the family specifically than strangers online.

You might consider Cued Speech.  Here is what Google Ai has to say about it: 

In Brazil, Cued Speech is known as Português Falado Complementado (PFC), or Portuguese Spoken Completed. This visual system uses handshapes and hand positions near the face to provide visual cues that distinguish consonants and vowels, making spoken Portuguese fully visible for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Adaptations of Cued Speech exist for the Brazilian dialect, aiming to improve language acquisition and literacy for deaf children by providing a clear visual representation of spoken sounds that might otherwise be indistinguishable on the lips.  

The good news is that your girlfriends aunt wouldn't need to learn how to produce the hand motions, just interpret them.  If you want her to understand you this is your best option.

Understanding that they aren’t going to fix your hearing is step one. Step two is wearing them as much as possible, you have to train your auditory nerve to adjust, and it will. But give it time. It’s been used to a certain level of input so it can be really overwhelming at first. Loud environments are still difficult for me and I’ve been wearing them 35 years.
Also, some deafness with age is probs related more to a slowing down of auditory processing, and could also make adjusting to hearing aids a bit more difficult, and also make sounds overwhelming. Patience is key, she should take breaks but try to wear them as much as possible.

Try Live Transcribe on Android phone or whatever the apple/ios version is.

I can't really hear anything in a crowded room like a restaurant or anything with background noise with hearing aids. Or in a classroom or something (I used to teach). 

So I don't see much point. I put the closed captions on the tv. And I took up speechreading so one-on-one conversation isn't a problem.

They're not very comfortable either. Some people get headaches from them.

I’m 75 and have been wearing hearing aids for 25 years. Hearing was still hard for me at times and I started using a transcribing ap, Live Transcribe. It’s been great when I want to have a conversation without asking someone to keep repeating themselves. If I’m on call, I use CaptionCall. This is very helpful because it automatically saves every conversation. If I do forget some details of a call, I just go back to the ap and read it again. I recently bought new hearing aids and I seriously wanted to take them back! But I remembered back to how hard it was to embrace hearing aids. So I stuck with it and after 3 or 4 weeks I got used to them. It takes time and effort to embrace hearing aids.

If you're someone who wears glasses in daily life, the feeling you get from a new prescription is similar to hearing aids. If not it's dull, achey, your eyes feel stained, you have a headache etc. And criminy, everything is so loud. The sound of people's feet on the floor at yoga made me want to scream.  

I had this problem for a week when i first started then 2-3 days after the adjusted my prescription.  Eventually my brain got used to what it was processing. 

So if she's not wearing them consistently she's going to feel like poo when she does.

Note that hearing loss has an impact on dementia. 

Beginning dementia might make it harder for her to manage the hearing aids.

There are divided opinions on rechargeable hearing aids. I have a friend fiercely claiming that rechargeable hearing aids ”ruined her life”. She can’t keep up with charging them, since they don’t last a whole day as she uses them a lot. Myself, I definitely have and want to have batteries.

I find that aids leave me exhausted. They amplify all the wrong things. The sound of aircon, the neighbours running upstairs, dogs barking. I end up having to work really hard to filter the sounds out. When I lived alone, I used to think “why bother?”

As a HoH person who's been wearing hearing aids since 3 years old, I'm used to not being able to hear as a person with no hearing issues would. I'm also still a bit insecure &amp; very aware when it comes to people look at you differently when you wear hearing aids. In my experience, a lot of people like to test if you really can't hear by speaking under their breath, saying things they know you can't hear, playing little mind games, etc. It can make you feel isolated &amp; targeted. The first time I received loaner hearing aids, I never knew how loud the world really was. I had a migraine for a week and only wore the loaner for 1 day because I couldn't handle it. 

A ""new"" HoH person now has to think about the constant need to charge them, can't get them wet, the price, the type to get, the maintenence, remembering to even put them on, the discomfort with having something in your ear all day, the possible periodic hearing tests, losing them, needing them to be adjusted, etc. That's a whole challenge to deal with. Now add being neurodivergent on top of that. It's a real struggle. Even as someone who's been wearing them all my life I still forget to do things and during emergencies I'm left with the decision to either grab my hearing aids first or deal with the emergency first and struggle to hear. 

Learning sign language could be a great idea, but remember the majority of society don't rely on it so they don't really know it or care to know it. That, too, can make one feel isolated. Plus, unless it's simple signs, I believe it's harder to learn as you get older.

Has anyone has success with Tinnitus maskers in their hearing aids?

Based on all the comments, you can tell there are a number of people for which all-day hearing aids are too much of a burden.  For these type of patients, i recommend the ClearCast PAL - a wearable hearing device that goes around the neck like reading glasses, and is there when needed, and easy to take off without getting lost.",2025-09-17 13:02:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njcjzi/hearing_person_here_what_might_make_hoh_people/
1njcbf9,hardofhearing,Moderate to mod severe loss experiences,"Hello! My 6 month old was born with mod - mod severe, relatively flat SN hearing loss (initial ABR showed 55-60 db loss, two follow ups showed 45-50db). He just got his hearing aids and is doing great with them, and we are learning ASL as a family, but I was wondering if there was anyone in this group who has a similar loss (or has kids with a similar loss) who could give some insight on what he is likely hearing without his aids (I’m thinking of bath time, bedtime, early morning and nights). Our audiologist played a simulation for us which was helpful but just trying to further understand what his every day is like. Thank you! 

[댓글]
Try to remember that even with his hearing aids in, he may need a lot of visual or physical cues that you’re interacting with him. I love that everyone is learning ASL! It’s going to be tough at times, but keep that part up! 

I don’t know for sure from his tiny perspective, but I would imagine hearing aids will feel overstimulating sometimes when there is a lot of noise happening. I felt that way as a kiddo a lot, but hearing aids have changed so much. You’re doing great!

I was born with and have more hearing loss than that, but some things that hearing people have been surprised I can't hear and I've been surprised exist at all:

- short intake of breath indicating someone is about to speak (I talk over people all the time accidentally bc of this)

- hearing through walls (seems like magic to me, once the door's shut or wall's there all noise is done with)

- secondary information; i can't hear if people are saying stuff next to me but not directly to me, which can cause some confusion bc they think I should have been close enough to hear it 

- I remember as a kid I just thought the world was just really quiet. Didn't understand people could hear more than I could for a while (I wasn't diagnosed till I was 6) 

(Might add more points later if I think of anything) 

Doing ASL is definitely very good!! He'll have way more opportunities if he knows ASL than not.

You can google a picture of the hearing loss/speech banana chart which will showcase different sound points.

Following because I have a one year old with the same loss🤍

I was born with moderate loss in one ear and severe, bordering profound in the other. My parents went the 'hearing aids and speech therapy, put her in traditional school route' so I didn't learn sign until my half brother was born (he has profound loss in both ears). You're doing good by him to learn and teach sign! 

Your son will still be able to hear things up close without hearing aids, it'll just sound kind of quieter and muffled a little. Hearing aids this young will be a great benefit to him and he'll develop speech at the normal pace. I didn't get hearing aids until I was 3 and was so far behind. It would be good to have some form of speech therapy/pathology appointments eventually to evaluate if he would have any trouble in school. For a long while I wore a device where the teacher would wear a mic and it would play directly into my ears.

I use a bed vibrating alarm clock now but when I was a kid I was able to get away with a really loud alarm clock at the loudest volume. I always put my hearing aids on as soon as I get up and they're the last thing I take off before I climb into bed. I don't ever take my hearing aids into the bathroom when I'm planning a bath/shower because I don't want to take any risks they would get submerged in water. I did ""lose"" hearing aids when I was a kid (just playing and them falling out never to be found) so definitely invest in insurance for them as he's growing up.

Kids can be mean so definitely keep an eye out for any potential signs of bullying. I dealt with that a lot and was kind of shy and withdrawn because I didn't want to stand out. 

Loud places will always be a struggle. Think restaurants, big crowds. Hearing aids are such a help but they're not perfect in noisy environments. He might get overwhelmed in crowds or noisy places. Bonus is you can take the hearing aids out and suddenly the world is a little quieter (my boyfriend constantly says he's envious of this lol). 

As he gets older and learns to read, captions on the TV are a must. Despite TV watching being in generally quiet environments I still struggle with understanding unless the volume is up higher than others find comfortable. 

You're asking the right questions and you've already done well by your son. He'll have a rich full life. Good luck!!

Edited to add:

Make sure his ears are *completely* dry before hearing aids go back in after a bath or else you'll be dealing with ear infections.",2025-09-17 12:52:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njcbf9/moderate_to_mod_severe_loss_experiences/
1nitlmt,hardofhearing,I regret not wearing ear protection at work,"I never protected my hearing from noise at work because why? It's so uncomfortable. Yeaa and now fuck me.

Half a year ago (im March, to be exact), after a sudden, violent high pitched sound at work my right ear suddenly became ""clogged"". That's how I thought it was. I could hear less and tinnitus appeared. I went to the laryngologist I was wrongly diagnosed but my ears were clean. I only got some B12 vitamin and steroids. Didn't help much.  
I didn't really feel like I could hear less but I had tinnitus which was annoying. The worst part of it is that this ear suddenly became super sensitive to all the sounds, it was unbereable. Listening to music in the car became a nightmare as even at low volume, all the high frequency sounds were like 3x louder painful.  
Also all the sounds become distorted when they're too loud, especially in a closed room with bad accoustic (family dinner during Easter). I'm having trouble understading what is being said because all of the sounds just mix together.

I was an emotional wreck because I did this to myself, I could've easily avoided it by wearing fucking ear plugs or whatever. I went to hospital after almost 2 months after the accident, they told I could've come earlier so I could receive medical treatment and steroids right into the ear. Maybe I could stand the chance to maybe improve my situation, but it was too late and not much could be done.

I regret so much not going to the hospital in the first place and waiting for so much time for nothing. I went through hyperbaric chamber therapy which helped a bit but it was already 2 months late.

Now, the situation is a bit better, tinnitus is kinda bereable, it's not too harsh and it quietens down when I rest, worsens if my hearing is overstimulated. Over sensitivity is also a bit better.

My audiologist told me that both tinnitus and sensitivity would go away on their own (up to one year) but I'm not entirely sure. I'm looking to hear your story or point of view.

I'm here for industrial hearing loss. Don't use noise canceling, stick the no noise ear muffs on and normal ear buds under. 

Industrial noise is tough. Vanity is stupid shit on the floor.

Protect your hearing now and give it time just like they said. Make a note of any changes and go see your dr if there aren’t improvements.

I began working in a beverage manufacturing plant in 1981 in the USA. There were no “foam” earplugs available at the time. (I’m not even sure if they had been invented yet) We used cigarette butts as earplugs in the “filling room”. As the years passed, foam earplugs and mandatory hearing tests were available. I have severe hearing loss and tinnitus now, at 62 years of age. I’m retired… and have hearing aids. I’m on my third pair of hearing aids, and have been amazed at the technology. I had actually begun experiencing hearing loss during my preteen years due to a specific antibiotic that was used back then. That particular antibiotic has since been removed from use I think. I tend to self isolate a lot. I don’t like going out into public places. But the world as a whole has become much more accommodating to people who are HOH. Especially now that I’m older with gray hair.

I was on an aircraft carrier...in an office spaces directly below the flight deck and there was a catapult as well.  I was in that office for almost 2 years.  The only time it didnt require hearing protection was when we were in port or flight ops were suspended for a short period of time.  Someone had to answer a phone and that person was usually me.  I wore mickey mouse, but would slide the right side off to when I was on the phone.  I have severe right side loss and moderate left side loss.  I remember some nights my right ear aching so badly it brought me to tears.  That was about 30 years ago.  I wish things could/would of been different, but it is what it is.

Hearing loss is irreversable. Only tinnitus and over sensitivity may go away. It got better, though.   
In the beginning, it was 80 dB loss at 6-8khz, now it's at 60 dB.

1ngvgwe,hardofhearing,Do you experience dizziness with loud sounds or musical beats (Tullio Phenomenon)?,"Curious: Does anyone else experience this? Apparently people with hearing loss and tinnitus (which I have) can develop this. I have been experiencing it with loud sounds and music for about 6 months now.

Online it is described as: 

“The Tullio phenomenon (TP) refers to sound-induced dizziness. TP is not a disorder or disease – it is a symptom of an underlying condition.

People with TP experience disequilibrium (unsteadiness), vertigo, nausea, and nystagmus (rapid involuntary eye movements). The symptoms are recurrent, brief and frequently triggered by certain types of noise or changes in middle ear pressure. Trigger sounds include loud sounds, high-pitched voices, and sustained musical notes.”

We all kind of lost hope that she'd ever find one she actually used.

But then, a few weeks back I was reading this blog on medium about hearing aids and it mentioned some of the newer, smaller styles that were supposed to be more comfortable. That got me curious because the prices were less that $100 so I did some digging and we decided to give one a try.

This time it's different. She's wearing everyday, joins in conversation without frustration, and even joked about finally being able to hear the gossip at family dinners again. It's such a relief see her smile instead of struggle.

I had it on during the flight, and of course I experienced pressure. I don't know if that's a cause or something.I did get water in my ears during the trip, but I didn't wear my hearing aid in the pool (I know it's not waterproof).

I also am wondering if it's the humidity from florida. I also have really waxy ears, and I don't know if its that. I have changed the dome/wax filter MULTIPLE times yesterday. I just want to know if anyone has ideas. I'm so lost. Thank you so much!

I think it's an easy fix but hard to diagnose without seeing it. Can you take it in to your audiologist?

Do you have a dryer box? Either an electronic one of a sealed box with a packet of desiccant in it? You could take the battery out and store it for 24 hours to see if that helps.

Also try a new packet of batteries, if it uses them. Maybe the pack you have has gone bad.

1nd9i69,hardofhearing,Doctor with extremely thick accent,"I have moderate-to-severe hearing loss. I’m finally getting hearing aids. They arrive at the end of the month.

I’m being assessed for memory loss. The doctor has a **very thick** Israeli accent. I just want to cry when dealing with him. I can’t understand a word he says. His report says I have receptive language deficits (duh, because I’m deaf. I had to keep asking him to repeat himself) and there’s some question of hearing problems (uhhh, there’s no question. It’s there in my chart).

I’m trying to transfer my care to another doctor in the memory clinic in the medical system I belong to, but he has to approve it. He refuses!!! I’ve explained that I’m hard of hearing, I have a very difficult time understanding foreign accents, and this is an accessibility issue. I’ve escalated this to the clinic manager and managed care (Medicare Advantage, which is an HMO). I said if I can’t change doctors, I’ll have to terminate the assessment. I’m at a total loss.

When the nurse told me this, she asked if my kids could come to the appt and help me out. I said my son works nights at the warehouse, and he sleeps during the day. My daughter works full time. I asked if the nurse could be in the room and “translate” for me. She said she couldn’t do that.

Can anyone advise me?

Slap 'em with an ADA lawsuit. Being able to understand what is being said is a reasonable accomodation.

Get a lawyer.

You can’t understand him because of your deafness. Demand real time captions for your next appointment. Get an IP relay number to make calls.  Make them accommodate you. IMO, you should stop bringing his accent into this. Just say you need CART for every appointment. Let the CART stenographer handle his and every other doctor’s accent. 

Getting a lawyer to file a suit citing the ADA is much easier said than done. It’s one of those prices of internet advice that everyone says even though very few people have experience with it.

I asked a similar question in a deaf group several years ago, and jeez! The hate comments I got!! Equating not being able to understand foreign accents with racism, I guess. In a deaf group!!!!

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Getting a lawyer might be the best option to get this moving.

I have a disabled 38yo son (autism, ADHD, Tourette’s, bipolar), snd I have a BUNCH of serious medical issues myself, so I’m very good at rattling cages, but this one has me a bit flummoxed. Well, today I have to send a letter to work on another issue. Another doctor in the group who needs a good slapping.

Most of my doctors at this medical facility (a university medical school and a Level 1 trauma hospital) are good-to-outstanding, and there are a few I want to clone and make a medical practice out of. I just have 2 God-complex doctors I’m dealing with. Well, I’m loaded for bear and am not backing down.

I’ve exceeded my daily allowance of cliches. LOL

As a training SLP I have to let you know receptive language difficulties are very different from hearing difficulties. Receptive language means you're ability to understand words, not you're ability to hear them! Someone with receptive language difficulties will also have trouble understanding written words for example, it's an issue with the way language is processed in the brain. Being hard of hearing can, but doesn't necessarily, impact your ability to process language. This doctor sounds pretty rubbish... hope you can find a better one soon

Same thing. I don't get foreign accents, people with those weirdly huge mustaches that cover the lips, and children and some women with high pitched voices.

I soft sell the accent. People get touchy about it, presumably like this bozo.

I would threaten a lawyer first.  Maybe ask the clinic admin if they know a good ADA lawyer and if they have the number for the local medical licensing board.  If they ask you why, tell them you tried being nice and it's no longer that time.  Then, if nothing changes, do a consultation with a lawyer.  As always, be sure to document the when, who, and what of all conversations.   Also, emails are good.  You could also start recording the appointments.  It might make them uncomfortable enough to approve a change of Dr.  At least you will have evidence that you are simply trying to get care.

Is there a different company you can use in the area who can take over your care?

Tell the clinic manager *in writing*:

&gt;

If they refuse, go straight to your insurance’s **ADA coordinator** or file a complaint with **HHS OCR**.

Key: use the phrases **“ADA,” “reasonable accommodation,” and “effective communication.”** Those trigger legal obligations.

I’m not even deaf or hard of hearing, but trying to understand someone with an accent is brutal. My kids are hard of hearing and I always think of them when I have to talk to someone with thick accent. Makes me sad 😔

Contact the patient advocate, if there is one.

I'm going the same thing. My doctor doesn't speak clear English. I called and requested a doctor change. For someone that can speak clear English because I can't understand my current doctor. I struggle understanding her, she's Asian.  I've contacted and spoke to different people about getting a different doctor and I'm getting absolutely nowhere. According to them you only get to change doctor's twice. I only remember doing it once. It's now a company rule, it's just between the doctors. I told the head person that was the only person that could help me. I have nobody to go with me. My husband with his work hours can't go with me. I need to go but can't because they are no help to me at all. I haven't gone since March, and I just can't get my needs addressed. It's frustrating!

I also have a son with Down's Syndrome. He has hearing issues and speech issues. I have to be there for him but with my hearing loss, it's easier said than done.

What state are you in?

Does your state have a Disability Law Office? In my state they offer legal assistance at no cost. They can step in to mediate and advocate on your behalf. They are more likely to take your case if you are not seeking a law suit but simple assistance exercising your right to communication access.

Ask how are the deaf assessed for memory loss? Look up an answer on Google before an appointment so you if they are giving a line pf BS.",2025-09-10 09:27:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nd9i69/doctor_with_extremely_thick_accent/
1ncoq6e,hardofhearing,Gas cooking safety,"Hi there! 

Half deaf since birth, I'm 52 now and have ME.

the illness ace the deafness is making me much more likely to leave the gas cooker on. I can't hear it. 

I left the gas on all night recently, when it wasn't lit. The windows were open and I think they prevented the gas from building up but the smell was very strong and frightening. 

I also leave the hob on because I can't see it in the daylight and can't hear it. 

I've flooded downstairs twice but taught myself not to leave the tap running anymore. However with cooking, I seem to be forgetting to turn it off. 

Has anyone got any tips? If I set an alarm on my phone, I won't hear my phone unless I'm in the same room as it. I don't have WiFi so can't use Alexa for cooking timing. However I'm thinking what I should do is have an old fashioned egg timer and wear it round my neck. It's not very sexy but might have to do. 

But if anyone else has got ideas I would love to hear them. I live in a rented property so not sure what tools there are I can use. I've written to RNID to see if they can suggest anything. 

I try to always check the knobs after cooking and physically make sure each one of them is off. But whenever I do forget, I do seem to be leaving the hob on. :'-( 

I don't want my flatmates to get upset with me, it's natural for them to be concerned and I don't want to be a problem!

I have a light on my vent fan above the stove. I turn it on when cooking so I know when the light is on, either the stove or oven is also on and needs turned off. I havent left the stove on for an extended period of time but I have forgotten that I turned the oven on.

I use my Apple Watch timer for some things like this. For example, I’ll set a timer for the water to boil bc I won’t hear it and in the past I’ve boiled it down to nothing.

Oh my goodness, I've got a smart watch so I can do this! I have been forgetting to wear it so I'm going to try that thank you very much x",2025-09-09 17:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ncoq6e/gas_cooking_safety/
1nc1pkc,hardofhearing,Experiences with TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR Glasses (or Other Options) for Real-Time Captions in Healthcare Settings?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a healthcare professional with severe hearing loss (HoH). I’m looking for a practical and reliable way to get real-time captions for conversations with patients, coworkers, and in professional meetings.
I’ve been researching:
* TranscribeGlass T1
* XRAI AR 

A few questions for those who’ve tried them (or similar setups):
1. How accurate and reliable are captions in real-life noisy environments (like a pharmacy, hospital, or clinic)?
2. Which setup is more practical for all-day professional use? (comfort, battery life, charging while in use, ease of setup)
3. Has anyone compared the captioning accuracy of TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR?
4. Any major downsides or frustrations I should know about before investing?
5. Are there other captioning glasses you’d recommend that are better suited for healthcare workers who need quick, accurate communication with patients?

I’d love to hear from anyone—especially healthcare workers—who uses these devices daily. Your real-world experiences will help me decide which setup to invest in.

Thanks in advance!

You can test out the captioning for the XRAI AR2 without the glasses by downloading the XRAI Glass app. XRAI supports lots of different AI providers including the cloud and on-device so it's much more versatile. It can also run in your hospital's own cloud, if available.",2025-09-08 22:19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nc1pkc/experiences_with_transcribeglass_vs_xrai_ar/
1nbvhba,hardofhearing,Should I Report being HoH to HR?,"Not sure if this belongs here or in another forum, but basically I am hard of hearing but without an official diagnosis. I was profoundly deaf as a small child due to illness. Around 5/6 I had ear tubes put in so I can hear again, with the caveat that very low or very high sounds I just can't hear. I went to an ENT a few years ago and was tested, but all they said was I am 'borderline'. 
This is affecting me in my job because we have a few people who talk really low but also really quietly. Not a week goes by that I'm not reminding them I can't hear them or asking them to repeat themselves. And I was late for a meeting because they changed the location 9 minutes before and I didn't hear the notification on my phone because I'm up and moving around. 
So my question is should I go to HR about this without an official diagnosis? I'm not even sure that they may do, just to cover myself from potential backlash. Thoughts? 

[댓글]
At this stage, see a doctor again explain the difficulty. Get a new hearing test. They'll provide you with documentation that your now diagnosed with hearing loss to provide to work. They may need to make reasonable accomodations for you.

I’d definitely recommend getting a hearing test (Costco does them for free, if that’s an option for you, and they won’t do the super annoying push for crazy expensive hearing aids that you’ll get elsewhere) and get a printout of your results, *then* go to HR. But don’t put it off.

My answer only applies if you are in the US and requesting reasonable accommodations under the ADA. I don't know how it works in other countries.

I just went through the process in the US. There is a form that your audiologist fills out that specifies how your abilities are impaired and what reasonable accommodations they think you should be offered.

Because of this, unless you have an audiologist willing to fill out the form, there's really no point in telling HR, they won't be able to do anything.

I recommend seeing an audiologist (not an ENT) to get a hearing test and then ask if they would be willing to fill out the ADA form for you. 

You also need to know what ""reasonable accommodations"" you are requesting. ""Cover yourself from backlash"" is not an accommodation. Being late for meetings is not an accommodation (although being late because the meeting location changed at the last minute is a problem that isn't disability specific.) Asking for information to be conveyed through text, asking for captions for video calls, those are reasonable accommodations. 

https://askjan.org/ has good information about what to ask for.

If you are in the US you would be protected and accommodated under the ADA but only if you self report to HR.

Additionally, if you are in the US you can get support from your state’s vocational rehab office. Every state has one but the name, funding, and services offered will vary. My state offers free college tuition, audiological exams, job training, job placement assistance, assistance in identifying accommodations, and sometimes they even pay for hearing aids. But you need to open a case and ask. These services are not advertised but are there for you.

No I would not disclose at this point. Try and find work arounds. One on my co-workers could not hear very well. She put a small mirror on her cubicle in front of her so she could see was behind her

[askjan.org](https://askjan.org)

I disclose my hearing loss but I don't leave it up to them to come up with solutions. I come with knowledge and resources. This shows I can manage hearing loss just fine. That said, I'm well educated at long last so I know my technology, what works and what doesn't. I can explain why hearing aids aren't called hearing miracles for a reason and why I need this, or that. Most of it is small accommodations. Between my hearing aids, lipreading strategies and introducing accommodations, I do fairly well. (Accommodations  usually help others too. Most people hide their hearing loss.)

It is hard to lead the way through. That's the difficult part. 

I'd also rather people know I can't hear rather than assume I'm stuck up or dense. 

If you don't have one already, get a smartwatch to help with help phone alerts...if you're talking about missing a text. That's helped me a lot.",2025-09-08 18:19:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nbvhba/should_i_report_being_hoh_to_hr/

1nb64oq,hardofhearing,HOH and pregnant,"Does anyone have any recommendations for when you're asleep with a baby? I'm panicking as I am due at the beginning of October with my first child, but I don't know what to do about when I'm asleep and baby starts crying. I wear hearing aids during the day and take them out at night, which means that I don't wake up to noises in the night. It puts a lot of pressure on my partner to wake up if baby is crying and I don't think it's fair that he will end up suffering from reduced/interrupted sleep in order to wake me up. I have a Samsung watch I use the vibration for wake up alarms in the morning. Is there something that can be paired with this?

[댓글]
My wife has no issue giving me the wake up slap letting me know it’s my turn to tend to baby in the middle of the night. 

We also have a leap frog baby camera which has a sound detection mode. In this mode, when it detects sound it will give a couple louder beeps.

Father to a one year old here. I got a bed shaker - there's a sensor under his crib that transmits to a little puck under my pillow that vibrates when he cries. Works great. Let me know if you're interested and I can dig up the make and model (wasn't cheap, I think like $150 for the full setup). I tried a smart watch but the vibration wasn't powerful enough to wake me up reliably.

Honestly.. just let your partner wake you up. I'm sure they would be getting woken up by the baby crying anyway. 

One thing I would suggest is set alarms for every 2-4 hrs at night to feed.. but some babies dont wake up as often to feed so you might just be waking for no reason.

I’m gonna get down voted and I don’t care. Take your hearing aides out and rest. Your partner will be okay they didn’t just grow a baby inside of them for 9 months and then give birth. My husband did all the night feedings after I broke down from the post partum depression that onset after my son was born. It was rough. Instead of trying to do it all because your sense of fair is off, take the rest guilt free.

Bed Shaker:

Hard of hearing here - I slept with my baby in her room. Never an issue. They do have vibration devices that will wake you up, so look into those.

All my kids have slept in my room (if not in my bed) so it’s never been an issue. But our baby monitor also has a vibration function. It’s an undvika from IKEA and was unfortunately recently discontinued but is still available in some stores and with some online orders. 

If baby wakes up it’s likely going to wake up both of y’all anyway unless you sleep in different rooms, your partner can also easily wake you up then go back to bed, but I would highly recommend sharing duties.

Set your alarm regardless of whether your partner gets up with you. I had to feed both my babies every 2 hours at first due to weight issues. They often were not crying at the two hour mark and I woke them to feed so I set an alarm all night long. 

But I also agree with the comments that support your partner waking you. It’s hard to know how things will go once the baby is here and you may need your partner awake with you anyway. I did not want to, but ended up needing to exclusively pump with both babies so my husband gets up with me every time and he changes and feeds the baby while I pump. It has bonded us all even more so as a family. Everyone’s sleep is going to suffer whether you like it or not and the baby is just as much your partners responsibility as yours.

I feel like this brings up the more general issue of how significant others play different role for a partner that is HOH or deaf, than they would otherwise. 

  
My best friend is a bit of a diva and tells her husband, ""You knew I would cost you money when you married me!"" While this is in jest, of course, there is some truth to knowing you will play a role in your spouse's/chidrens' lives that might look a little different. One that you signed up for. 

  
I have a husband and 2 kids that are hard of hearing. All live in my house right now and indeed, I am called on to do things for them that isn't maybe the norm. Do I need to wake up my 20-something kids to make sure they wake up in time for work/class? Yes, sometimes it's helpful/necessary. Do I make phone calls for them, schedule appointments, relay what was missed? Absolutely. Because I love them.

There are ways to cosleep safely. And if you cosleep your baby is so close to you that when they start stirring you notice it before they start crying. Their movements wake you up. Then if you can, you can just breastfeed in bed without getting up. For us, everybody got more sleep that way.

I’d recommend checking out [this monitor](https://www.hellobaby-monitor.com/products/hellobaby-video-monitor-with-5display-pan-tilt-zoom-video-baby-camera-no-wifi-night-vision-temperature-lullabies?variant=46443335188647&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22058489442&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAomAnzKbAL7MbXlqmALTETjmQ63lC&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_fnFBhB0EiwAH_MfZhqKk4g8z8qBuAGJ0vtzgCjGc6AUq3wdPbisSa597nBXt_CQJKbqmhoCFlkQAvD_BwE)

This monitor has an Eco-Mode setting so it dims the screen when it’s quiet but then the camera turns on when it picks up sound. This could be a great idea to have and when the camera turns on you know it’s picking up on your baby crying!

1nafgy4,hardofhearing,requesting interpreter/disability accommodations at a theater,"i found out i was HoH last november and since about january, have been using hearing aids. i currently use jabra power BTEs and have been learning ASL for a year now. even though i am in the mild-moderately severe loss range (cookie bite shape), i really have been struggling hard with hearing people with and without my aids, of course its better with though. i have found regardless that i prefer to use asl and my bf is learning now as well. i’m not fully fluent yet in ASL but i’ve been learning at my college and frequently use it with my partner day to day (mostly bc i prefer using it over speaking and hearing but also bc we’re both learning so good practice!) as well as attend Deaf community and ASL club events frequently!

i have been looking into tickets for twilight in concert to go to with my bf. CONTEXT: this is where u go to a concert hall, theater (not movie theater) and they play the movie while having an orchestra to do all the music live. we're both musicians and twilight is one of my favorite movie series so its a win-win! 

there are not a lot of tickets left in the theater near us but the only seats left are in the very back rows of the upper balcony. there are still some accommodation seats (not just ones for ppl w mobility issues) left though. i have been considering calling the theater to maybe request an interpreter. while i *can* hear with my hearing aids, it isn't the best even still and i will not be able to hear the movie/music from the very back without any captioning or interpreter. i will still be able to enjoy the music by watching and listening but the speaking portions i will struggle with. i don't want to take any seats away from disabled people who NEED NEED these spots but i am wondering if this could be a good option. i am in asl 3, can hold conversations and am very good at picking up signs i don't yet know with context so it's not like this would go completely unused. i know the twilight script like the back of my hand but if there are things i miss, it'd be nice to have something in front of me. i always use captioning devices at the movies as well. 

would it be wrong for me to call for the accommodations and seats? would i be taking this away from someone else?

Never be afraid to ask for what you need. The worst that can happen is they will say no.

In my experience, movie theaters all have closed caption devices available. They don't always work, but they are available.

OP, you are deaf/hard of hearing. You know ASL. You have the right to an interpreter. You’ve already emailed. You should call the theater box office on Monday (IME, they are well versed with relay calls). Ask what your options are. They will be required to caption the movie or provide interpreters. If the movie is already open captioned, great! If not, they will provide interpreters. When it’s time to buy the tickets, they should cost balcony prices, but you will probably be moved to orchestra left or right. 

Let the theater, event manager, and interpreters work out all those details. You just need to enjoy the show.

Those seats are designed for physical accessibility for those with service dogs and/or mobility aids. 

They may already have an ASL translator set up for the event and a way for you to see them from any seat. 

Actual theaters meant for stage plays or musical events tend to have excellent acoustics and sound systems to make it easier to hear performers.

I am confused, what do you mean by NEED NEED? I also have a cookie bite hearing loss, but mine is solidly moderate and I actually can't wear my HA to movies/concerts because they intentionally make it loud to the point of being loud enough to damage hearing. Are you saying you don't need accommodation really, but it would be convenient if it meant better seats?

Those seats are typically physical/mobility for people with mobility aids or the seeing eye dogs so they can get up.

If it's opera they usually have subtitles at most modern performances. They may have some caption device available or can use your phone.

edit: Wait it's twilight in concert? You'll be able to hear the orchestra regardless of where youre sitting. You may need earplugs honestly.

And provided the film's not edited, you can lit download the subtitles to twilight and sync it on your phone or something. It's a popular film.

Even if you “just have clogged ears” a professional can clean them safely improving the quality of hearings. Make sure you’re being careful with your exposure to sound. You don’t want to damage your hearing.

It's definitely worth getting checked - basic hearing tests are non-invasive and easy, and they'll be able to tell you if you have earwax or a more long-term issue.

You don't say which country you're in but you spell British, so if you're in the UK then Boots and Specsavers do free quick hearing tests too - that was enough to tell me I needed a more serious investigation.

You could probably do a test online for free or find an app to do it

Ask a parent your your legal guardian to take you to an ENT. Get it checked out.

Don't play guitar with headphones its a recipe for disaster. Can you get a marshall microamp (the belt amp) or something? Maybe practice at school? A lot of musicians wear earplugs.

Of course you should get it checked out! If it’s ear vax, they’ll fix it in two minutes. If it’s other kind of heating loss, you’ll need to adapt to that.",2025-09-06 21:40:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nabmpd/should_i_get_checked/

[댓글]
ALL THE TIME! Sorry was that too loud?! My aids broke at the end of July and I can't get in to get new ones until the end of September...

Why are we always accommodating hearing people? Shouldn't it be the other way around?

I traumatize them back. “Oh, am I speaking too loud? Sorry, it’s due to my LIFE LONG EXISTENCE AS A MEMBET OF THE DEAF COMMUNITY YOU FUCKING PINECONE” 

I get so heated about this, it is SO demeaning

I rarely get this because I hear myself so much through bone conduction and more or less lost my hearing AFTER I'd already learned how to speak and at what volume. I grew up with a step father who could hear a fart from china and learned early on to regulate my speech, walk gently if I didn't want to get caught late night snacking. Please don't read this as I had a bad stepfather, he was and still is a very good man. But in a strange way, I was trained without even knowing I had a hearing problem.

I’m hyper conscious of talking too loud so my husband always tells me to speak up. We can’t win.

I mean... I've been told I'm talking too loudly and I just... Talk less loud? Being hard of hearing doesn't mean you can't learn to adapt. It's not ""catering to hearing people,"" it's being a considerate human. Some people have sensory issues and loud voices in close proximity can be uncomfortable or even painful. Other people just don't want someone shouting in their ear- it hurts.

If they're not being an ass about it, there's no reason to take it personally when someone asks you to lower your voice when you're too loud.

Yup me too. I’m HoH, and I’m always told to lower my volume. And hearing people don’t want to repeat themselves if I didn’t hear them… love that!

I always get told I don't speak loud enough. because I can hear myself and I feel like hearing myself means I'm yelling. its just no winning so sometimes I don't talk and just use sign language.

I didn't realize how ableist this was until I met other people with hearing loss in college. My (hearing) mom would tell me this constantly growing up even when other people thought I wasn't being that loud. She basically used this as a way to shut me up whenever I got too excitable as a kid. 

I lost my hearing when I was two and I'm the only deaf person in my family. There isn't much of Deaf community where I live -- not even a school for the Deaf in my state. Then I went to Gallaudet and realized just how bad things were for me.

i’m excited to move into our new house just because i can yap as loud as i want without annoying neighbors

I’m sorry I can’t hear you with your hand over your mouth and my insurance doesn’t cover hearing aids. 🤷🏻

1n93k0y,hardofhearing,BAHA hearing aid,"Hi, I wondered if anyone could help or offer advice. My Nan has had the BAHA surgery and has the BAHA connect but when she wears it she gets really loud screeching feedback whenever she sits back on her chair and it touches the back of it and when she touches it so now she refuses to wear it. 
Seems such a shame that she’s been through the surgery for it to be so crap. 

Any advice would be really appreciated 

[댓글]
unfortunately feedback with the BAHA when something presses against it (chair, hats, touching it, etc) is going to happen. She just has to adapt and keep things from pressing against it. I wish there was something different she could do, but unfortunately that's just the price to pay to hear! hopefully, besides the feedback, she's receiving good benefits from her BAHA!

I experience the same thing with my Cochlear America Osia. To keep it from happening, I place a small pillow behind my head and off to one side away from the sound processor. This keeps the sound processor from touching the headrest on my chair. 

Hopefully, her chair will accommodate something like that.

Thanks for your reply. 
She sees no benefit to it than what her hearing aids give her so she won’t wear it now unfortunately because she can’t sit back and rest her head back on the sofa without it screeching. Seems like a bad design. Hopefully they fix it

The feedback is because the sound generated is being picked up by the microphone, I have the same issue if I lay in bed with mine on. I stream audio from my phone when laying down before bed. As I don’t need to hear I’ll just turn off the microphone and the feedback goes away. Other times say I wanna wear a winter hat feedback is an issue. I’ll turn off the aid microphone and use live listening on my phone the audio picked up on my phone will play in my “ears”. I actually have an accessory microphone that can clip to my shirt but I almost never have it when I need it. I always have my phone with live listen on my phone.

I've just joined an alternative rock band as a bassist, and our first rehearsal makes me face a tricky issue. We play with backing tracks and click, so all sounds go through **In-Ear Monitors**. 

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to adapt to this ecosystem in a way that comfortable and safe, and would love to find someone who's been there to chat with !

Few ideas below :

• My first thought was to just use regular IEM and crank up the volume to match my loss, but I was told by my audioprothesist that my hearing aids go through a custom compression the IEM don't have, and that loud volumes in the earbuds might be risky for the little hearing I have left.

• I thought of keeping my hearing aids and wearing isolating drummer headphones over them, but the comfort is 0% and they can't cover everything because of the impairment.

• The suggestion from my audioprothesist was to use a bluetooth TV Streamer that I have (ReSound Unite) to receive the sound straight into my hearing aids, which would be the most comfortable but might not be stable (maybe interferences with other HF comms), and I'm not sure the isolation would be enough. I have yet to test this at the next rehearsal, but I want to be extra cautious with the drums.

That sounds like a headphone amplifier maybe. Did it plug in to the tv too?

If he uses a hearing aid, a lot of the HA brands have dedicated devices for this purpose. They plug in to the tv and send audio wirelessly to the aids.

Roku?

Check the tv. Roku has a dongle. You can buy replacement remotes for $30.

If it isnt and he refuses to use bluetooth assuming your time has any value it'll be cheaper to buy him a roku tv that comes with a remote that's 3.5mm and  you or if you dont live nearby, paying the geek squad to hook it to his cable. Tv will be $150-200. Geek squad prob another $100 but check first.

Wow, this is so beautiful. You meeting your mum where she is at with her hearing loss instead of expecting her to meet you in the hearing world. 

This is going to stay with me as a HoH person, reminding me of how often I am hard on myself but this is only because of internalised audism.

Often people don’t want to try other communication than just speech, because it’s just weard and not normal communication. That’s just wrong. I wish more people would try to do things differently sometimes and notice that sometimes it actually opens up communication.

I use the translator app on my phone.  It was a lifesaver during covid hospitalization.   Always nice when someone thinks of something like this to improve a life.  Hopefully  you will have many more years to use this.

1n0le1i,hardofhearing,"20 years old with Auditory Processing Disorder, mild hearing loss &amp; auditory attention difficulties – looking for advice","Hello everyone,

I’m 20 years old and was born with Auditory Processing Disorder due to a genetic factor. Since childhood, it has affected my daily life. I can hear people’s voices, but often it feels like they are far away — even when they are close to me. Most of the time, I cannot understand what they say unless they repeat it once or twice. On top of that, I also have mild hearing loss and difficulty with auditory attention, which makes focusing on conversations even harder.

This makes conversations (especially in noisy places) really frustrating and sometimes isolating.

I’d like to ask:
– How do you cope with communication in daily life?
– Do hearing aids, apps, or strategies help in cases like mine?
– How do you deal with the social/emotional side of this condition?

Any advice, resources, or personal stories would mean a lot to me. Thanks so much! 🙏

Since your problem is with processing sound I would propose an experiment.  Do a search for Cued American English and you should find a few free training video series.  After you've gone through the training videos you will know if you can process English easier visually than verbally.  It won't solve your problem but knowledge is power.

I’m HOH, on the moderate/severe side. I’ve worn BTE hearing aids my entire life. I also have a Deaf family so ASL is also in my back pocket. 

As far as coping strategies, I tend to make self-deprecating jokes over my hearing loss. (Kind of like I take away people’s “power” if I beat them to it first.) 

Repetition: If it’s people I’ll never see again, I’ll bluff my way through the conversation and puzzle out the words I didn’t get later. If it’s the absolute pits, I’ll text it on my phone’s Notes app and they can answer that way if they prefer. 

It took me several VERY long years, but I finally found my tribe. My friends don’t care that I have to make them repeat themselves because they’ll rephrase what they said so I’ll get the missing part. They’ve done charades for me, which was hilarious, and they’re just very, very accepting of me as a whole. (Bonus: they now watch everything with captions! They were so excited to tell me that they “can hear the TV better”, LOL!)

I don’t use many apps so I can’t speak to that. I’m sure others here can help in that area. 

I hope this helps you a bit. It is/can be isolating, but keep putting yourself out there and you’ll eventually find your own tribe, too.",2025-08-26 13:08:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n0le1i/20_years_old_with_auditory_processing_disorder/
1mzu1rf,hardofhearing,Immediate memory deteriorating and difficulty following conversations,"I am 37 and have had hearing aids for about 5 years. Mild to moderate cookie bite hearing loss.

I am having a lot of immediate memory problems and just a hard time following normal written and spoken communication.
Having difficulty following conversations like everything just gets dropped or not even held by my brain. Literally struggling to focus and remember on things said 10 -30 seconds ago. It’s like it’s not clicking in my brain.

Wondering how much of it might be related to hearing loss.

I already have had an MRI but the neurologist isn’t available until December.

Thanks.

I would recommend talking to your primary and requesting a full blood panel to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or hormone imbalances. Also, I would record yourself sleeping to see if you’re snoring. Are you at a higher risk for developing conditions related to cardiac function or other bodily functions? These things can all impact your overall function and should be checked.

When my mom, then in her 60s, experienced similar short term memory loss  she was alarmed and thought it might be Alzheimer's disease.

It was not.  
In her case, short term memory loss was a side effect of a blood pressure medication she was taking.  
She was able to remember facts and events again once she got a different medication.

I wish you well.

I also have the same issues. I went to the dr years ago. He told me it was a lack of focus. I was so frustrated I never went back. Fast forward, I got a bad concussion from a car accident and had to work through a couple of years of therapy. At least now o have something to blame it on.

I’ve experienced a similar thing. Had significant hearing loss in last 2 years and find I can’t recall information or remember people’s names like I did. Think it’s likely because I’m missing lots in direct and indirect conversations and not sleeping as well because tinnitus has ramped up x10🫤

Hope that you are able to find an answer. I’ve experienced similar issues since my loss started in 2022. It deteriorated a bit more rapidly in 2023. By the end of that year I started noticing issues with concentration, focus, and becoming forgetful. Quickly losing track of my thoughts. I’ve received an MRI and CT scan, though nothing was found. I’ve not seen a neurologist yet however. Hoping that once you’re able to see one it provides you with information!

It could be caused by that, but it also could be something different, or a combination of things. Maybe you got a stressful time and need a break, or something.",2025-08-25 15:44:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mzu1rf/immediate_memory_deteriorating_and_difficulty/

1mymy4l,hardofhearing,I just want to completely detach sometimes,"I’m GenX and HoH with a spouse and teenage daughters and I have all the responsibilities etc… but sometimes I just want to drink alcohol in the basement for several days and not even deal with people at all for a little while. I hate it - trying to communicate with people. I’m exhausted trying to deal with them. The thing is, I don’t even have a basement. No one I know has a basement. I live in S. California and no one has basements. But just going full on Hunter S Thompson makes so much sense lately. But I can’t because I have to pay rent and put food in my kids’ mouths. There are no breaks, not even for one evening and I’m exhausted because I can’t effectively communicate with people. It’s a sort of weird isolation, like stuck between 2 worlds where I belong in neither one.

Not the alcohol and basement bit but yeah, disconnecting is high on the list sometimes. My partner has kids who come to stay regularly and they’re wonderful kids but it is exhausting. Between the constant talking/shouting and the talking to me whilst facing away so I can’t hear them or shouting stuff to me from across a field 🙄 I’m either over stimulated or worn out every day. I keep explaining myself to them to try to get it to improve but it doesn’t and I get very irritated. It’s not their fault, they’re just kids but it gets me down. At the end of a week long stay I am grumpy and my partner sees it. We’ve started having to have times when we have the kids where I get to be home alone and decompress. He takes the kids out for a number of hours so that I don’t get constantly worked up. It does help but then I carry the guilt of not wanting to be around the kids. It’s a double edged sword.  Maybe being a drinker would help. 

We don’t have a basement either.

I just space out and don't bother trying to listen sometimes. I figure if it was really important they would make the effort to get my attention and communicate clearly. Its like I don't hear anything if people don't get my attention first and its not that they weren't loud enough for me to pick up sound, its that my brain has somehow learned to tune out conversations I can't hear clearly.  So its being in the room still but also being checked out... its peaceful. And you don't have to hide in a basement drunk to do it.

We have a basement, but it's my husband's man cave and office area and he likes the TV on constantly, so it wouldn't work for escape  I get what you're saying. I'm lucking if I have 1-2hrs of social energy in me even when I'm with friends that I know well and like. It's hard to be 'on' for any length of time and work tends to take most of that time. Then I doomscroll and don't feel much better for it. Hope you figure out something to help you feel more restored.

I can identify with you. I have 2 teen daughters who full on yell when I ask them to repeat themselves. My husband says never mind when I ask him what he said. Sometimes being at home with family feels extremely lonely and isolating. I can’t imaging how I will feel though when they are both gone on their own. Oh, I also want to hide in the basement, but I don’t have one. I hide in my room when I get frustrated.

Also gen X with two teenage daughters. 🙌 I’ve worn hearing aids since age 2.  It’s hard work!   I agree- being in between two worlds is tough.  Not hearing, not Deaf.

I grew up and lived in Southern CA for most of my life. I moved north to Utah and everyone has basements! I work in the basement and have to admit, I do like that space to get away from upstairs activity. It is quieter down here, most of the time.

I'm Gen X and have been wearing hearing aids since '93. I felt between the worlds for a long, long time. I have found my place with a lot of work but I still exhausted with the communication someday. I phase out of the noisy world taking my hearing aids out. Everything fades to mute and if anyone wants to talk to me, they have to use the 3 Golden Rules... Get my attention, face me and be within 6 feet. Hell, they have to use the 3 Golden Rules even with my hearing aids in because they aren't hearing miracles! My hearing aids can only do so much.

Luckily my kids are grown and gone but I remember those tough years and feel for you!

There's a lot of whys behind the 3 Golden Rules so I wrote about it here to help others. They help save my sanity. [https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/)

1mw3vvi,hardofhearing,Struggling with hearing loss and feeling left out—how do you handle it?,"Hi, I’m a 25-year-old woman living in Korea. My English isn’t very good, so I got some help from ChatGPT. In Korea, I’m not officially considered hearing impaired, but I do wear hearing aids. My tinnitus started when I was in high school, and I began wearing hearing aids as an adult. At first, I only wore one, but now I wear them in both ears. Currently, my hearing level is around 55 decibels in each ear.

I started wondering what kind of jobs people with hearing loss have, and how they cope in situations where they can’t fully understand conversations—like when meeting new people or being in noisy places. Do you let others know about your hearing loss from the beginning, or do you just try to manage? I’d really like to hear about others’ experiences and opinions.

Personally, whenever I have to interact with people or go outside, I get really nervous without even realizing it. Once I get used to it, I feel better, but there was a time when I’d come home completely drained and exhausted. I can hear sounds, but I often don’t understand what people are saying. After asking them to repeat themselves a few times, I’ve had people frown or just stop talking to me, which made me feel small and discouraged. Talking on the phone is also very difficult for me. Once, a family member even told me, “Why should I talk louder just for you? My throat hurts,” which really hurt.

Honestly, I don’t know how I’m supposed to live going forward, and it all feels so overwhelming.

It sounds like our experienoes are very similar in many ways.

My hearing loss is pretty much in that range. Everything you wrote really speaks to me. I’m older &amp; grew up without any support and without understanding that my problems were mostly related to hearing loss.  I’m happy for you that you understand the issue so early.

The first thing that helped me was realizing that the nervousness was due to difficulties processing and trying to understand without being able to hear everything. Once i understood that, things got a bit better, i realized that it was my hearing loss rather than some deeper personality problem.

Honestly, i haven’t solved everything, so i’m interested to see what other reddit users suggest, but here are some things that have helped me:
1. i stopped expecting myself to function normally in situations where i can’t hear well. Sometimes i need a break. So it’s okay for me to not try to get every conversation, or to go do my own thing.
2. I tell people that i am looking forward to talking to them, but that i’m hard of hearing and won’t get everything
3. I try to find opportunities to chat with people one-on-one.
4. I try to control the hearing environment: 
5. I learned sign language. This has been amazing for me. I can finally communicate without the struggle to hear. I’m only limited by my skill, which will gontinue to improve while my hearing continues to get worse. The more i learn, the more i identify with the Deaf community.
6. MIFI microphones (that send sound directly to my hearing aids) or iphone’s live-listen feature allows me to hear 100% of one-on-one conversations and more of the group conversations. If i avoid places with a lot of background noise or reverb, it can be considerably better.
7. Communication with my family. They used to think i was a jerk for interupting or ignoring them, or for controlling conversations. They are slowly realizing that while i’m not perfect, a lot of the communication issues are actually a result of my hearing loss.
8. Learning more about hearing loss and how it affects people. This reddit channel has helped a lot. There are also some good books on life with hearing loss, but i’m not sure many of those are in Korean, but it looks like there are some, such as •	『나는 청각 장애를 가진 심리 상담사』  that might be interesting.
I’ll come back and write some more if I think of anything, but the fact that you’re searching for answers is the most important thing!
I’m curious, what have you found to be helpful?

It has been a bit of a journey for me. When I was first diagnosed at 18, my hearing loss was 45-55dB in both ears. I felt shame wearing my hearing aids and instead of telling people I have hearing loss, did a lot of masking, pretending, mirroring people like laugh when people laughed, nodding like an idiot when I did not understand. At work, I never said anything. My line of work is emotionally/mentally draining by nature and the listening fatigue did not make it easier, for sure.

With the support of a hearing therapist, I have gained confidence about disclosing my hearing loss, I have progressed in my career and recently gained another qualification in a profession where listening is a huge part of the work. My hearing loss now ranges between 55dB to 80 dB but I consistently tell people about my hearing loss and what I need, even at work. I ask for adjustments to reduce listening fatigue and prioritise self-care so I do not burn out.

Wearing hearing aids is only a partial solution, they do help us hear better but do not make us hear the same as ""normal"". It has been a long journey to accepting this. Even with the latest technology and gadgets, adjustments and other strategies are needed. Once I made peace with this idea, I worked on understanding what strategies helped me in different situations, experimenting with how sound works - like where I sit, what type of room. If it is too noisy, just switch off the HAs or if it is for a conversation, ask people to move somewhere quieter etc.

What I found is that the more confident and assertive I have become around my hearing loss and adjustment needs, the less rude and dismissive people are. They likely see it through our body language. I still have areas I need to work on, undoubtedly but even though my hearing loss is gradually but surely approaching the profound range, ironically, I feel better about myself now than when I had mild-moderate hearing loss.

I am aware than different countries, different cultures may have different attitudes toward disability and this will influence how we feel, think and relate to others. Part of the journey for me has been to push boundaries one tiny step at a time. The times when I felt/feel exasperated and exhausted of educating people are numerous but I remind myself that even without hearing loss, we need to manage differences with others.

I inherited my hearing loss. I grew up with people saying “never mind” after the third repetition of what they said. It’s particularly hurtful when it’s the punchline of a joke that I never get to know what it was. 

That “never mind” feels and is dismissive. Plus, it reinforces my self concept of not belonging with other people or groups. I feel excluded, especially when I need to set up a favorable environment that creates “extra work” for them. 

I recently learned that when people say “never mind” that our response should be something like “Please, I really would like to hear what you have to say. Do you mind trying once more?”

I have not tried this approach yet. 

[Never Mind article](https://livingwithhearingloss.com/2015/05/26/please-dont-say-never-mind/)

Tell yourself it doesn’t matter what you don’t hear. It’s a shift in mindset from the assumption that we need to hear everything. Hearing Aid industry promotes that idea that we are broken so we go buy their products to be “fixed”. Accept yourself. Reject that which you are not and cannot be.

Use captions for all the calls. For mobile pixel has good captions.

You're not alone with that experience! It's actually even a common situation for people with hearing loss. There are even studies about the correlations of hearing loss and social isolation.
I personally am very honest about my hearing loss and tell people about me being hard of hearing. It's making things clear for people, so they know what's going on if I need to ask them to repeat things more often.
Also, I can tell them about what it's like to not hear everything, if they want to learn more about it. Creating a bit of awareness, that helps to avoid misunderstandings on both sides. Because most people don't know much about being hard of hearing, what exactly is damaged in the ear, and how the little machines in my ears work.

I’m here seeking for answers too, so I am so sorry if I couldn’t give you exact solution to this problem. 

However, I want to say that I hear you. Everything you say is relatable because I experienced what you experience too.

Location? Innocaption is only in the US because it’s paid for by the FCC.

Phone call captioning is built into both mobile operating systems now:

iPhone

https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-live-captions-of-spoken-audio-iphe0990f7bb/ios

Android

https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en

It does require the use of a headset so you can see the screen. I have my ""action button"" on my iPhone set to Live Caption so I can pull them up with one click. 

One downside of the iPhone version (idk if Android or Innocaption are different) is that it only captions the other person, it doesn't caption your own speech. I'm used to captioning on Zoom and other video calls that captions everything, so it's a little weird.

I've been using two phones, one an old pixel phone with the recorder app to record the call  and it does transcription

and the newer pixel to do the actual call using the speakerphone function and the caption call option turned on.

but it seems the other suggestions here are better than what I've been doing.

1mv026q,hardofhearing,Popping in ears for three years,"Back in 2023, I got very sick while traveling (possibly covid) and ever since then I’ve had persistent popping and fullness in my ears when I swallow or talk. I also have hearing loss from former deployments and the popping makes hearing much more difficult. Sometimes it wakes me up at night. Doctors keep saying it’s allergies and gave me meds that didn’t work. I feel like they don’t take it seriously. No matter what climate I’m in, it never lessens. I’ve never had allergies or trouble with ear fullness before this issue appeared. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

[댓글]
I had what I believed to be a popping ear, and it turned out there was a small dog hair inside my ear canal that kept rubbing on my ear drum. My doctor took a waterpik (one of those water flosser things) and flooded my ear with water for an extended period of time. The little hair finally dislodged, and my ear popping stopped.

Have you seen an ENT? I wonder if it’s related to your Eustachian tubes.

Had this too. My ENT checked Eustachian tube function - all fine. Eventually the audiologist tested the pressure in my ears and found that my eardrums didn’t move when under pressure suggesting something in behind. Few weeks later they gave me grommets because sprays etc just hadn’t worked. The surgeon said that when he made the incision into the eardrum it was “full of mucus and crap” 8 weeks later and it’s clearing so so much. 

Worth asking this question.

So I want to ask will my ears be redamaged if I have too loud volume in my headset even I do not feel loud for me?

Do your hearing aids have a Bluetooth feature? That’s what I do. 

Yes, the loud volume can do more damage to your ears. Me personally, as a kid I never worried about out it because it was the only way I could listen to music.

Be careful with this for sure. I've gotten myself in a paradox a few times where I turn music or games up loud enough to sound as loud as I remember from before hearing loss. Because I now have significant loss, if I do that, it means I'm listening to the music \*way\* louder than I should be, which then causes additional hearing loss, and cycles. 

It's a pretty safe bet that if you have bad loss, whatever sounds loud to you now will make that loss worse.

Does your brand of hearing aids make a device that hooks up to your TV and streams into your hearing aids.. I wear Widex Moment HAs and I have 2 devices for this.. One is a TV-DEX that hooks up to the optical out port on my TV and streams the audio from my TV directly to my HAs and the other is a COM-DEX that does the same with my computer.  I use the computer one for work to listen to Zoom/Teams calls and YT videos, but I'm sure it would work for gaming..  I know the TV DEX works for gaming, I've used it with my Xbox on that TV.

You can get volume-limiting headphones. I have a pair of IsoTunes Bluetooth ear buds that limits the volume to 79 dB with no microphone. There is another version with a microphone that limits the volume to 85 dB.

Yes, you should stream the sound to the hearing aids instead.

The headphones aren’t adjusted to your hearing loss. So either you won’t hear the sound correctly at those frequencies you have a lot of hearing loss in, or you increase the volume but then get too loud sound for those frequencies you don’t have a lot of hearing loss in.

Why not talk to your audiologist?

I have been using Shokz, bone conduction headphones. Since they use your skull instead of your ears to transmit the sound, there is like no risk of further loss.

This would be a good question for your audiologist. My hearing is such that my audiologist said listen to whatever I want to because it's not going to make my hearing any worse. But that is specific to my loss which is Progressive and genetic in origin so I'm going to go completely deaf eventually anyway. Also as far as music and audiobooks or anything you run through your phone you can get a app with an equalizer and use your audiogram to invert it into the equalizer and that should allow you to equalize your hearing so when you do turn the volume up it works better.  You may even be able to purchase an equalizer for your TV and gaming system and run your headphones through that. One last thought on the behind the ear versus in the ear is to consider how easy it is to lose and in the ear versus the behind the ear. I've had hearing aids for 40 years and the in the ear ones are horrible if you just set them down without thinking about it and forget where you put them. If you think hunting for car keys is difficult wait till you misplace one of those itty bitty in the ear ones. At this point I have the colored inserts for my behind the ears so that at least I have a chance of seeing them.

Yeah, high volume is something you have to be mindful of. I have a program called ""Equalizer APO"" on my PC, that I use to adjust the sound to my needs. It's not perfect, but it does a bit of what the hearing aids do and allows me to have a more normal volume on the headset.",2025-08-19 16:16:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mun0cl/headphone_volume_while_hearingimpaired/

First, you should speak to an audiologist about your options. Do not get OTC hearing aids they will make your hearing worse. Sometimes, your dr has to really go to bat for you to get your covered like mine did . With my insurance, I got my hearing aid for free ( costs was 4k)  as it was covered on my insurance ( they just didnt want to pay it.) Do u have insurance? The cost out of pocket could be less. Also, ask if you're a candidate for Cochelar Implants. My insurance covered that except the initial consultation. I got one CI on one ear and a hearing aid on the right ear. Im going in for another consultation for the right ear to get a ci put in there because the CI beats the hearing aid by miles. Ex. Clarity, volume, no pain on/inside the ears, etc. I know the struggle and the exhaustion of trying to strain yourself to try to hear. Its annoying and drives u and everyone around u crazy trying to communicate.
For reference of what aid I have:
RESOUND hearing aid and Cochelar nucleus 8

Are you in America? If so, reach out to your state's Vocational Rehabilitation center. they can help with financing the hearing aids, especially since it's something that makes your job easier! don't try and do over-the-counter ones, Sam's Club, CostCo, etc.; go with what your audiologist advises. I have Phonak Marvels for a severe-profound hearing loss and absolutely love them. but again, reach out to your local Voc Rehab and they should be able to help you

Personally I’ve been hard of hearing for 50 years since a baby. Got hearing aid at 5 years old. Hate them. I tailor my life to not have to need them. I have simple Driving job. Listen to podcasts all day. Figure out how to be yourself instead of how to fit in according to societies expectations. That is too exhausting.

Would I say that I'm ""half deaf"" since I cannot hear at all out of one ear? Or is it more proper to just say that I'm hard of hearing? Or does it not matter, and this is a silly thing to be worried about?

[댓글]
Deaf is a spectrum and your label is your choice. When introducing yourself or reminding people, I would say “Deaf in my left ear” or the right ear is the good ear. Just something so people know how to communicate with you. If you say “half deaf” people tend to just talk twice as loud, which doesn’t help.

I struggled with this...am I ""hard of hearing"" or ""I can't hear well""...I decided I'm just hearing impaired. That usually suffices.

It doesn’t matter - I have a moderate hereditary bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.  The only thing I won’t call myself is deaf, because that can imply not hearing at all or membership in a particular group.

I say hard of hearing when I’m just being casual.  I say hearing impaired when I need the other person to quickly understand they need to speak up, though I also just tell people “I wear hearing aids” to make things clear sometimes because I’m still young-looking and my hearing is still good enough that I “pass” as normal hearing.

If you have a hard time hearing because of hearing loss but don’t have total loss then you’re hard of hearing.

I say “deaf in one ear,” unilaterally deaf is the technical term.

How you describe yourself is entirely up to you. You might get some comments if you say ""hearing impaired"" (it's my preferred term, I actually hate saying ""hard of hearing"", though I do it for others out of respect for them), but you are an autonomous individual with the right to call yourself as you wish. 

I used to say ""half deaf"", but now I just say ""little-d deaf"". 

Imo, using more technical terms helps with people understanding the severity of the situation. ""I don't hear well"" is often met with ""oh, I don't either."" 

But also, I'm so sorry, that's a lot of change to deal with.

I used to say hearing impaired, but I now think hard of hearing is more accurate.  I wouldn’t use deaf, because I can get close to “normal” with hearing aids.

Say whatever you want though. Nobody really cares, or at least they shouldn’t.

My usual intro: “Hey, my ears are trash. It helps if you speak up and make sure I can see you when you’re talking. Thanks!”

I tell folks I’ve lost the hearing on my right side.

""I have a hard time hearing and wear hearing aids.""

The audiologist recommended a set of either Phonak or Oticon receiver-in-ear aids for $7300, and it would include all future visits/adjustments for the life of the equipment. I have zero insurance coverage in my policy for hearing aids. I'm in my 40s, and this is my first time looking into getting hearing aids due to the cost, and I'm still feeling some sticker shock. They didn't provide details about the specific models, but indicated the Phonak (which I preferred) had a 2nd microchip for managing background, would be water resistant for exercise, and have bluetooth connectivity, so maybe it is the Audeo Life Paradise; but the purchase costs for a pair seem much lower online?  I liked the sound quality during the test, and the center is well-rated/reviewed in my area, but it felt like a ""these 2 are your only options, pick them up next week"" hard-sell kind of experience.

Does that price seem unreasonable for my level of loss and the ongoung support/office visits? Or is it worth shopping around?

I paid $6,000.00 for mine so I'm not entirely surprised by the cost. Do you have a Costco near you? They can be significantly cheaper.

If you're in the US check out Ebay. People sell used Hearing Aids on there quite a bit. Sometimes they sell new ones from India they're still phonak or oticon or other brands but the prices are a lot more reasonable. I've done this maybe three or four times and not had much of a problem. Even if you run into a problem, if you can get a pair for a couple hundred dollars, it's worth the Gamble. The only thing I would advise if doing something like this is that you make sure you have access to an audiologist who can program them. If they're older models, they may not have the software or the connecting cable, and some audiologists may not work with them just on the principle that they make too much money selling a new one

If you’re in the US and need them to save your job you may benefit from vocational rehabilitation. Medicaid rates though. Seems awfully high.

I paid $4150 for my last pair

Phonak 

I suggest going with a closer audiologist at least for your first pair. You may need multiple sessions to get the best out of the device until you’re comfortable with them an understanding the different options available

Apparently there are some leasing programs available that might work for you.  As a new user you may get very little use out of them at first, at least until you get used to them.

As far as online prices go it's not really fair to compare them with an Audiologist.  Although they may only make about $45/hour they are going to charge you $200/hour.  Since those are included in the cost of your hearing aids over time your free adjustments may be worth the difference in initial price.",2025-08-18 16:40:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mtr8dp/hearing_aid_quote/
1mthpr2,hardofhearing,Help for an audiologist please,"Hey folks 👋

I’m a Doctor of Audiology based in London. About a year ago I started posting on social media as DrYovina (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)- mostly covering the less talked-about side of audiology. Not just hearing aid reviews (though I throw a few of those in), but also the random misconceptions, weird facts, and things people don’t usually get told about ears and hearing.

I want it to actually be useful rather than just me rambling, so if there are topics you’d like explained, myths you’ve heard, or anything ear/hearing related you’ve always wondered about, drop me a suggestion. Would love to make content that people genuinely find helpful.

Cheers!

How to understand your results. I’m one of the people who would take a test you run and ask zero questions because I was raised in a cult and have no idea how to ask what your tests mean.

How to take HoH and Deaf more seriously. I love technology, enjoy hearing, and I do appreciate all the opportunities that exist today, but there definitely is an overemphasis on hearing being the only way to communicate, get social inclusion and prevent dementia. There are many things that are harmful with this worldview:

* What happens to those who can’t get a CI? The health care system seems to totally ignore these people’s situation, because they can’t fix the problem through medical means. Those who aren’t helped by the development we have today, they also deserve communication and inclusion. This group is getting worse and worse conditions and no one seems to understand how important it is to have solid language access and inclusion even when spoken language is not accessible. 

* We HoH are **always** at a disadvantage every time we have to listen, even with the best technology. The person with normal hearing will always be able to hear more in social situations. The consequences of that are devastating. We are always judged by our ability to hear anytime we communicate. That’s not fair. Allow us and encourage us to use communication that is 100% accessible to us, like sign language or text. 

Hearing is a great tool, and necessary and convenient in a hearing society, but I think there should be much more emphasis on how to actually allow us to communicate on more equal terms. We shouldn’t be forced to rely on our weakest sense all the time.

Can you really lose hearing from a virus?

Differences in symptoms between HoH and sensory processing issues, and the correlation. In really simple terms.

Hi, will tinnitus and over-sensitivity in my ear go away? Six months ago I got hearing damage caused by a sudden, loud sound. My audiogram shown a big notch at 6-8khz, reaching to 8dB. Now it's at 60dB. What's worse, I've had tinnitus since then and this ear became super sensitive to louder or higher sounds. When a sound is above a certain volume level, it's kind of distorted and if it's from 6-8khz range, it's painful. I was wrongly diagnosed and started recovery process too late (I went through HBOT only after 2 months after the accident).

Other than that I don't really feel much difference in hearing in my every day life.

Tinnitus, though, usually gets quieter when I rest or go to sleep, it's not constant or harsh but still annoying. It has got better since the beginning but it's still really annoying. I was told many times by doctors that the hearing loss is irreversable but my audiologist said that tinnitus and over-sensitivity will likely go away (may take up to a year) but I don't really know. I think it's more of a mental struggle.

I would like to hear your opinion on that.",2025-08-18 09:57:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mthpr2/help_for_an_audiologist_please/

My ears are not self cleaning like at all not even a little bit. They are made of skin grafts! Yay! So I have to go to an ENT to get them cleaned out. Except they don’t look normal so I need to get my ears microsuctioned. Problem is since my regular ENT retired no one else micro suction my entire ears.

ENTs won’t clean my ears out with micro suction. Some even say there’s nothing in there. I’ve been to many ENTs one even walked out on me. I started getting pictures. Showing crusts (dead skin builds up from the skin grafts). Still doesn’t get cleaned out. I tried going to the neurotologist that’s worse they won’t clean my ears. I tried a fellowship trained ENT he won’t listen. I went to Mexico. I have pictures from clinic level otoscopes. I just need my ears cleaned out how do I tell them? They all want to not touch me when I go in but just chit chat and then waltz out without a care. How do I establish a relationship with an ENT who gets me? My ears build up dead skin every three days. It’s skin graft from my trunk they used for my ear drums and canals. Yay! Its rare! It’s constantly building up and no professional seems to understand my ears aren’t self cleaning! 

I even went to a world renown clinic that does tons of CIs and they wouldn’t clean out my ears the way I need and then played this psychological game it’s all in my head. Even though I have pictures. 

Please how can I talk to an ENT? My hearing is affected and now my ears ring. If I say I still feel the stuff in there here’s a picture. They just say no there isn’t I looked. Meanwhile the skin graft in there is building up dead skin cells. 

If I bring in information from medical textbooks it’s completely ignored and not reviewed. 

Then they’ll ask for an audiogram! Fun!

1miwq9c,hardofhearing,untreated trauma,"I’m the strong silent type. Like Sylvester Stallone. At least what I believe in me. I don’t want people around me to worry about my. Most importantly, my family.

Three weeks ago, I just finished hearing test and diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss. At least 38% hearing loss at both ears. At 20 years old. To be honest, I didn’t cry about it. It was liberating. I am right. It’s not in my head. I acknowledged it.

Now, everything changed. I always bottled up my feeling. I didn’t confront it. Like a fire which starts slow, it grew into something I can’t extinguish. I am depressed. I need help. But, I don’t know how to. I didn’t have any friends. I don’t have money to go to therapist. I want help.

Thinking about how it all makes sense now. It’s not about lacking focus or ADHD. I am not antisocial. I just have hard of hearing (HoH). That’s why I couldn’t understand what people said clearly.

Growing up, it is hard to pinpoint exactly what is my problem. My parents thought I was slow. I start to speak late than any other children. I still talk like a baby until I was 6. “You should be aware of your surrounding”. That’s what they always said to me. I can hear what people say, it’s just not clear.

“When you can’t (physically) do what society expects you to do, you go around it and rebel”.

I fucking go to hospital a lot of time to receive the treatment. But there always something to hinder me from it. Dad rejected further appointment. Doctor needing previous document. I was a minor. All fucking excuses. I fucking hate the world!!!! I want to be dead. I fucking fucking hate it. I hate the way I am born. I want to stop everything.

Hey friend- your trauma is valid but also there’s no reason to wish you were dead over this. You are going to be just fine. You’ll have some minor annoyances but those seem to have been there for a while and now you know what they are and you will be able to manage them a lot better than you did before you knew.

You are going to be fine.

Looks like you are grieving the hearing loss. And feeling helpless because it’s not something that can be fixed. 

Start with allowing yourself to grieve.

I can relate to this. It took me a horrendously long time to get used to the way things are. To top it off my family has [cult ties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science) which made it so much harder to seek help.

1mita6e,hardofhearing,"Muffled Dialogue in Movies and Games (System-Wide Windows PC, Channel-Specific Fix for Headphones - Especially If You Have Hearing Loss)","After YEARS of whisper-quiet dialogue being drowned out by music and explosions, I finally fixed it — and it works across the entire system, not just in VLC or one app. Now, this is for WINDOWS PC. I have tested this with several headphones and DAC/AMPs with/without.

This method lets you:

* ✅ Boost **dialogue (center channel)** only
* ✅ Tune **specific frequencies** per speaker
* ✅ Adjust **each speaker/channel volume independently**
* ✅ Apply it **system-wide** (games, YouTube, Netflix, VLC, etc.)
* ✅ Tailor it to your **hearing loss** using an **audiogram**

**🚨 IMPORTANT: Source Must Be 5.1 or Higher**

This fix relies on your media having a **true 5.1 (or 7.1)** audio track.

Why?

* Dialogue is isolated in the **center channel** in surround mixes.
* Stereo (2.0) audio has **no true center channel**, so boosting dialogue selectively is **not possible**.
* **Dolby Atmos for Headphones** virtualizes the full surround field (including center channel) for stereo headphones — letting us isolate and EQ it.

||
||
|**Source Type**|**Works with Dialogue Boost?**|**Notes**|
||||
|Blu-ray / MKV rips|✅ Yes|Best case — full surround mix|
|Netflix / Disney+|✅ Usually|Confirm surround is active|
|YouTube / MP4s|❌ No|Usually stereo — no isolated dialogue|
|Games|✅ Yes|Most modern titles output 5.1+|

**🧰 What You’ll Need**

||
||
|**Tool**|**What It Does**|**Cost**|
||||
|**Dolby Access**|Enables virtual 5.1/7.1 surround w/ center channel on headphones|**$14.99 + tax (one-time)**|
|**Equalizer APO**|Core engine that filters audio system-wide|Free|
|**Peace GUI**|User-friendly interface for per-channel EQ and volume|Free|

**🔧 Step-by-Step Setup**

**1. Enable Dolby Atmos for Headphones**

* Install **Dolby Access** from the Microsoft Store
* Go to Sound Settings &gt; Output &gt; Spatial Sound
* Set to: **Dolby Atmos for Headphones**

✅ This creates a **virtual surround mix**, including a proper **center channel**, even through regular headphones.

**2. Install Equalizer APO**

* Download: [https://equalizerapo.com](https://equalizerapo.com/)
* During install, make sure your **headphones/output device** is selected
* Reboot after install

**3. Install Peace Equalizer GUI**

* Download: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/)
* When prompted, click **“Yes”** to overwrite config.txt
* Launch Peace and choose **Full Interface**

**🎚️ Boost Dialogue &amp; Tailor to Hearing Loss**

You can now:

* Adjust **each channel independently** (Center, Left, Right, Sub, etc.)
* Apply **per-channel EQ** (e.g., boost only dialogue frequencies on the center channel)
* Apply **different EQ per ear** (Left/Right) using your **audiogram** or hearing test

**Example: EQ for Center Channel (Dialogue)**

||
||
|**Frequency**|**Gain**|**Purpose**|
||||
|500 Hz|\+2 dB|Adds warmth and low-mids to voice|
|1000 Hz|\+4–6 dB|Boosts vocal clarity|
|2000 Hz|\+4–6 dB|Adds presence and enunciation|
|4000 Hz|\+2–4 dB|Consonant sharpness|
|8000–16000 Hz|\-2 to -4 dB|Reduce sibilance or hiss|

We used a real **hearing aid audiogram** to shape the Left and Right channels for hearing loss, and EQ’d the **center** for dialogue boost.

**4. Save Your Preset**

* Click **Save**, name it something like: Dialogue Boost - Custom Hearing
* You can bind it to a Peace hotkey or slot (Set 1–4) to toggle on/off

**🎯 Why This Works Better Than App Fixes**

Most apps (like VLC) only boost center within the app. This setup works:

* 🔄 **Across all apps &amp; games**
* 🧠 With **custom hearing loss profiles**
* 🎮 In games (like Call of Duty, Elden Ring, etc.)
* 🖥️ On **YouTube, Plex, Jellyfin, Netflix**, WHEN SUPPORTED WITH 5.1 AUDIO SOURCE and more

**🧪 Bonus Tips**

* ✅ In Peace, enable **“Prevent Clipping”**
* 🔊 Lower Preamp in each channel if EQ boosts are too loud
* 🎧 Works great with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and games
* 💬 You can boost center *and* shape full headphone sound signature

1mifowh,hardofhearing,Explain my hearing loss,"Can someone explain my hearing loss?

I’ve had hearing loss since I was around 6 or 7, but I never got hearing aids despite a report showing it.

My father also developed hearing loss in both ears around 16 after pneumonia.

I can’t remember any other cause for my hearing loss. I do remember severe earaches in early childhood, which may have been an ear infection.

Interestingly, my 2-year-old brother also has hearing loss in both ears. He recently had a 1-year-old son and was diagnosed with mild hearing loss in one ear.

No other family members have hearing loss.

Doctors and genetic testing haven’t found an explanation.

Can anyone suggest a possible cause?

Also, can someone comment on my hearing loss results and advise if it worsens? My hearing is muffled, but I can still understand people I know.

Am I considered deaf? Apologies for the silly questions, I don’t really have anyone to talk to or understand my hearing loss. 

I usually wear hearing aids at work or social events, but not at home.

I would say you are considered hard of hearing since you can hear some but not well.

we can’t know why you have hearing loss. could be the result of your infection or it could be genetic (your brother and nephew have hearing loss) 







No you wouldnt be considered deaf as you have some level of hearing.

My genetic hearing loss is (we think) caused by Ehlers Danlos Syndrome

From what you shared, you sound more hard of hearing than deaf (the term ""deaf"" gets used in different ways, sometimes medically (severe to profound loss), sometimes culturally (people who use sign and identify as Deaf, capital-D)). Since you still understand people, you're probably in the mild-to-moderate range. If you're curious, you might want to try over-the-counter hearing aids. My husband's in a similar spot and he's been using OTCs from audien hearing. They're not as high-tech as traditional hearing aids but they help with speech clarity and are way more affordable.

Were you tested for auditory processing disorder or do you have tinnitus? According to you the results of the test showed your hearing was fine. Even people with good hearing struggle in noisy environments like you described. This suggests your hearing issues aren’t the result of loss but rather environmental factors. As you acknowledge you have issues hearing when you aren’t concentrating and the environment is loud. With all the aforementioned information it would seem the solution is to pay more attention to what people are saying and limit external noise.

Yeah, I had the same thing, “normal” hearing on paper but struggling in noisy spots. What helped me was trying an OTC hearing aid with good noise reduction. Way cheaper than custom ones and it actually makes group conversations less exhausting.

I went with [this one](https://rewarduplevel.com/aff_c?offer_id=1904&amp;aff_id=36719), but honestly any decent OTC model that boosts speech and cuts background noise could help if you’re in the same boat.",2025-08-05 09:52:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mi4wyx/product_for_people_with_hard_of_hearing_problem/

I’m the primary support person for my mom. She recently underwent a major operation. The great thing is that she is cancer-free! However, the down side is that she is deaf in one ear. 

Down the line, she has the option of a procedure to get a bone anchored hearing aid. For now, however, I’m looking for key technology, gadgets, or devices that could help her. 

What do you wish you had known about or used as a hard of hearing person? 

I’m thinking about her alarm clock…she falls asleep on her hearing ear, so her deaf ear is facing up, and she can’t hear her phone or alarm. I did turn on the flashlight setting on her iPhone so it flashes and vibrates when she gets a message. 

I’m educating myself on behavior changes, of course - speaking louder, slower, clearer, close by, etc. 

Thank you in advance!

Not sure where you are but www.connevans.co.uk stock a lot of accessories

When she gets the aid  check out Deaf Metal for jewellery

Two apps have been life savers... first is Innocaption.  Have it on my Phone.  Transcribes phone calls as I have them.  Second is Otter Ai.  Transcribes conversations live as you have them.. invaluable at doctor appointments .  I dont know if links are permitted here but you can google them and they are first results

My phone's vibrate is loud enough to wake me reliably but they also sell bed shakers that'll definitely do the trick.  

Also look into connecting it to the fire alarm.  Or flashing visual alarms for that.

Communication tactics beyond just louder/slower/closer:

The first word said is almost always lost/not heard because you're still latching on to the fact that someone has started speaking.  Wait until you have their attention.  ""Hey so um I'm looking for... where are the keys?""  

Don't repeat exactly when things aren't heard.  Vary how you say it, both in word choice and intonation/pattern.  And give more context.  Words make sense in context.

""The keys"" - ""the what?"" -&gt; ""for the front door, the keys, keychain, for the lock"" *mime using a key*

Check with the local fire department. Many used to be able to at least install flashing smoke alarms. I’m not sure if they do anything else.

I have an alarm that goes on my wrist and vibrates to wake me up. Also the Live Transcribe app has been a lifesaver many times. As for behavior changes, I usually do miss the first part of what someone says if I don't know that they're talking to me. Making sure you have her attention, or she knows that you're addressing her before saying something could be useful, depending on her preference.

Look into Sunrise Alarm clocks.",2025-08-04 19:08:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mhmmv9/seeking_advice_for_supportive_devices/
1mh6azs,hardofhearing,Tinnitus getting worse?,"Hello!

I've been diagnosed with tinnitus for about 7 years now, getting the official label when I was about 15 years old (now 22). I am not exactly sure when, but sometime over the last year it's gotten much worse to the point that I can hear the ringing in my ears through music, over fans, and even in crowded rooms if I focus just a bit. I know there's no cure for tinnitus, but is it possibly worth going to get checked out again? It makes it hard for me to sleep and process what people are saying to me. I'm unsure if tinnitus alone makes me HOH so i do apologize if this is not the correct place to post, but any advice on what I should do moving forward would be appreciated. One thing I will add- I am autistic and use noise cancelling headphones (at a low volume, usually less than 20% or so) on a daily basis to help regulate, and sometimes i sleep with the noise cancelling on and no music if my partner is particularly noisy. Do we know if noise cancelling alone can worsen tinnitus?

Thank you!

Have you gotten your hearing tested?? I have moderate hearing loss in my right ear and tinnitus for over 10 yrs now.

Definitely worth it to get checked out. There are conditions that can cause ear ringing, and you’ll want to know if there’s an underlying reason for it and if it can be treated. An ENT doctor or an audiologist should be able help you.  

Tinnitus can be a symptom of hearing loss itself. You might want to bring up the fact that you’re having trouble processing what people say to you. Hearing loss can be very subtle and often shows up as issues with speech clarity, where you can hear someone, but have trouble actually understanding what they’re saying. I have both tinnitus and hearing loss, and wearing aids does help relieve the tinnitus temporarily. 

I don’t know about noise cancelling headphones making tinnitus worse permanently, but I definitely notice my tinnitus more when wearing them. I think the lack of auditory input makes my brain kick into overdrive and makes the tinnitus more noticeable. Very quiet white noise can actually help make tinnitus less noticeable, so that might something you can experiment with to see if it helps or not. 

Also stress, high blood pressure, dehydration, and certain medications can make tinnitus worse. Might be worth drinking a lot of water and looking into other possible causes to see if anything’s making it worse.",2025-08-04 06:45:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mh6azs/tinnitus_getting_worse/

Welcome! Have you been to a doctor to find out the cause of your hearing loss? It's possible that there's something going on (like wax buildup) that can be reversed, and if not they can discuss your options.

1mh0jk0,hardofhearing,Subtitles for commercials,"NOTE:  99% of my viewing is streaming services, not live TV. Those rare times that I do watch live TV, the commercials do seem to have captioning, mostly. 

But I’m surprised that so many commercials don’t seem to have captions or subtitles. This seems to be true for multiple streaming platforms. It doesn’t make sense to me. 

I know I know, ads suck lol. I’m not a huge fan of commercials, but sometimes I do want to know about what they’re trying to sell me. And if I’m interested, I’m not getting the info!

i've def noticed this! i kind of think of it as a blessing lol.

I’ve noticed this as well. It’s like wow, they must not want my money because they don’t care enough to caption their commercials

I wish when Spanish ads are playing they would caption in English. If Spanish is going to be a common language in our country, I'd like to try to learn what they are saying in these ads so I can start learning the language a little bit more.

I've noticed this also. It all seems like random visuals sometimes. A couple walking on the beach - what are they advertising? Who knows? Whatever they're selling, I guess I'm not buying it.

They're not legally required to caption commercials in the US, so they don't.

1mgyyrl,hardofhearing,Grandma has vertigo,"My grandmother has been suffering vertigo for about a year. It started after the hearing aids that she liked, which would charge on an outlet, outside of her ear while not in use, suddenly stopped charging and her doctor gave her new hearing aids that had an internal battery. Within a day of use, she started experiencing vertigo so she's quit wearing her hearing aids and has spent the last year being seen by various doctors to try and figure out the cause of her vertigo. She lives 2 hours from us and has to drive here for her doctor's appointments, but has become scared to, because of her vertigo. She said her eyesight also seems to have extra sensitivity to light, although I'm not sure there's any correlation, but ear, nose and throat DO have related issues, so I don't want to omit that statement.

I feel terrible that I haven't sat down to piece all of the history together sooner, but I did tonight, and she shared with me that she had a stapedectomy 40 years ago (which is metal and the reason she can't do an MRI). 

1st question I asked google- what material is used for stapedectomy. 
Older uses were steel, tantalum, platinum. Newer options are Teflon and non-metalic options

2nd question - what are the symptoms of a dislodged or failed stapedectomy?
One of the symptoms is vertigo.

3rd question - do hearing aids with internal batteries have magnetic properties?
Most hearing aids, including those with internal rechargeable batteries like lithium-ion, use a combination of components that are susceptible to magnetic interference. 

So, looking for info of the potential for her vertigo to be related to her latest hearing aid batteries being a bad mix with her older metal stapedectomy, thus causing her vertigo.

Has anyone heard of something like this happening or experienced this themselves? 

I suggested to her that she get on the schedule with an ENT other than the one she has been seeing that has written her off as a medical mystery, and I will be attending the appointment with her to address these questions and hopefully, any additional info I can gather from readers who may share similar experiences or have knowledge of this type of situation. 

Thank you so much in advance!

I've lived half of my life with a vestibular disorder (the vestibular system is what controls spatial awareness as well as causing vertigo when things go wrong).

An otoneurologist is the kind of specialist doctor she needs to see, not necessarily a general ENT. While it does seem like her vertigo \*may\* be related to the hearing aid, it could also be entirely coincidental. The only way to know for sure is for her to visit that specialist.

1mfudf2,hardofhearing,Need to vent thank you for reading,"So we have an interim supervisor at my job, i’ve barely spoken to them, we aren’t friends.  I let them know as i do with all new employees that i am hard of hearing and that if i don’t hear you, that I’m not ignoring you.  

They react by having the biggest smile and asked me if i told the other interim supervisor (there’s 2) and i said no.  I thought that was weird but i just shook it off.  

They then come back into my area and mention something about their child who i ask about.  They say their child is young and then they begin to mimic speaking to me but with no sound coming out and say their spouse does that with their child, pretends they don’t hear the child.  I just look at them and smile awkwardly cause that’s weird af.  

So during that interaction i gathered that they think it’s funny that i can’t hear.  

So then they come up yesterday to say goodbye and they do the mimicking speaking without sound again!!!  They say oh i’m gonna do this all the time like it’s the funniest thing ever. I’m helping someone so i couldn’t really react.  

Then i starting getting anxious and angry like i don’t know you well enough to be making fun of my hearing loss, you’re in a position of power over me and it’s just rude af.   I called my direct supervisor and told them you do realize that being hard of hearing is a disability right?  

So i left, they texted me to apologize but I’m left with anger and questioning why the fuck do people think my hearing loss is a fucking joke.  I’m fucking tired of it.  

If you got this far thank you…..

You can have a multitude of conditions that are supported but hearing? It's a joke. Have excellent health coverage? Maybe you'll get 2g  towards 8g hearing aids. You are accountable even if you hear stuff wrong and the majority of times you say ""pardon"" people get annoyed and repeat things in the exact same volume/direction as the first time, and look annoyed to boot.

What a couple of douchebags, and you definitely have grounds for bringing this up with THEIR supervisor. Make sure they are aware that mocking a disability is illegal under the ADA. 

I had a situation where a co-worker outright mocked me to my face, and in front of another co-worker, in a similar manner. I went to my direct supervisor, who was great. She spoke to him alone and then with me present. He gave me a halfhearted ""I'm sorry if you thought I was rude"" type apology, which I didn't care about, and my supervisor told me privately that this guy had a few incidents in his file already, and she had added this one. 

I didn't feel the need to take it further after that, but I might have if he was someone with authority over me. 

I'm sorry this happened to you.

Document this, including their apology. Insist upon an in person apology. Texting it to you is insufficient. There is repentance and repair work to be done here, which includes them facing you, hearing you, and acknowledging that their actions were hurtful. They need to become the person who doesn’t do this kind of thing in the workplace, and hopefully not at all.

This is harassment and bullying and SO unkind and not professional. Like at all.
Go to HR. They have zero tolerance.

This is terrible, I am so sorry this happened to you. I have coworkers (who know I am HH) that will intentionally talk quieter after I ask them to repeat themselves and then laugh when I ask again what they said. 

One way I have found to take back my power from microaggressions like these is to hold an accountability mirror up to their behaviors/words. For example, if that interim supervisor does that mimic speaking again, you can allow for a few seconds of silence while you take a deep breath with a smile on your face, and say “did you think I’d think that’s funny because you know I’m deaf? :)”. It will surprise them and their response will tell you everything you need to know. Might sound a bit petty, but it’s effective as hell.

Report them to HR for harassment about a disability. If you're in the States, it's illegal under federal law.

I’m really sorry this happened. I hope this 
 supervisor’s interim period is short and you can work with someone more empathetic. 🫶🏻

Hang in there, sadly there are a bunch of stupid people we all have to deal with.

That's a really difficult situation. Their behaviour is disrespectful and toxic af, but what to do about it? From my experience, if you don't do anything they'll keep bullying you. But if you say something, they will act like they did nothing wrong and you were the one being unfair and aggressive. People like them cause trouble, no matter what. :/",2025-08-02 16:11:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mfudf2/need_to_vent_thank_you_for_reading/

1mfjx9r,hardofhearing,got told hearing can improve but I still can't hear?,"Had hearing loss in the higher ranges for years. Diagnosed as pretty mild, still a pain in the tail. It was diagnosed in 2020 right before covid. My doctors company went under so it hasn't had any follow ups. 

Could swear my hearing is worse than it used to be. Walked past a mall kiosk today where they did hearing tests. Sat down to do it. Had to hit repeat on the upper half 7-10 times and I literally couldn't tell if I could hear the sound or if it was just because there was an animation in time with the beep on the screen and so I was following that. I always hit that I can hear it if I'm ever not actually sure because I don't want to skew it. 

Mall kiosk test actually said no hearing loss at all. All in the green. Not even border line. Despite the woman having to repeat herself explaining it and shutting the front doors to cut back on background noise. She said sometimes because I'm in my mid 20s hearing can improve even if it previously tested in the loss range. But I still can't hear people when they talk! Am I nuts? Did my hearing actually get better and I still somehow just can't hear people?

Ps it isn't central auditory processing disorder, they did a long test for that and said I did not have it and just have hearing loss. 

weird reddit glitch so posting again to fix, mods please don't incinerate me 

[댓글]
Am I following this right you were told by some mall kiosk your hearing improved? I’m very doubtful of the validity of results from a mall kiosk. You should be seeing an audiologist.

You mistake commercial events for healthcare. There is a reason audiologists and Ear-Nose-Throte specialists have many years on university training. Please go and see a professional.

I wouldn’t consider anything being done by untrained people at a mall kiosk accurate. They want you to stop and spend money on them, they’ll say whatever it takes to get you to stop.

Giving the kiosk some credit I always need a test done in a specialized soundproof booth for them to be accurate for me. I just need a nurse to walk loudly up a hallway to make my test to come out inaccurately. I’d get it redone in the proper way to see if it’s stable or worse.

Hello! First year audiology student here! I recommend you to go to an audiologist, they could test you for higher frequencies (which in the kiosk they normally don’t do) and also perform other tests to understand better your hearing loss, like speech testing , otoacoustic emissions , tympanogram etc

I wouldn't put too much stock in mall kiosk tests. They're more like a quick screen than a full hearing check tbh. I'd recommend a full hearing test, either in-person or online. Don't just go off that one mall result. If budget's tight, there are OTC hearing aids that are decent and affordable. I've been using audien atom pro 2 for my mild hearing loss and it's only &lt;$200 for both ears. It's not fancy but it helps with speech clarity and bg noise.

The sound waves are likely bouncing back all over the place so you need materials with soft surfaces instead that absorb the sound. For example, carpet flooring is better than wood or tiled flooring, place a table cloth on table, put some sound panels on the wall.

1mfdqva,hardofhearing,Newly Diagnosed with Otosclerosis &amp; Severe Tinnitus – Seeking Advice (Canada),"Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed with otosclerosis in my left ear after CT scans and multiple hearing tests. My hearing loss is around 60-70%, which is frustrating, but the real struggle is the tinnitus. It’s severe high-pitched, loud, and constant.

I’m lucky if I get 4-5 hours of sleep, it literally wakes me up. It’s been two years now, and despite what people say, it hasn’t improved. Some days the volume dips slightly which is a relief, but the anxiety attacks, especially at night, are relentless.

My ENT has given me two options.

Surgery - I was told it could restore my hearing and, more importantly, fix the tinnitus. However, the risks include losing my taste permanently and total hearing loss in that ear. Since I’m in Canada and my ENT hasn’t performed this surgery in years, I’d need to go out-of-province and start fresh with a new specialist.

Hearing Aids - I was told they can help with hearing, but they likely won’t do much for my tinnitus given how severe it is.

Another factor is that I’m a former chef and may want to return to that career. Losing my taste would be devastating. The tinnitus is unbearable, but is surgery worth the gamble?

For those in Canada **a**ny  top-notch surgeon you’d recommend? If you chose surgery, how did it go? Any regrets?

Personally, streaming music helps distract from the tinnitus.

&gt; However, the risks include losing my taste permanently and total hearing loss in that ear. 

...

&gt;but the real struggle is the tinnitus.

You kind of get used to it. The nerve deadens or something. I have a really loud refrigerator which hums and I used to leave a fan on in the summer and I have a white noise machine too which I used at first but I kind of got used to the tinnitus.

You'll want to dash your head out against a wall for the first few months but after that it's kinda eh. Avoid loud noise.

I also put on the radio low at night if it's very quiet and I'm at the computer.

You can't fix tinnitus. Anyone who tells you that you can is lying. You do get used to it, and the white noise stuff makes it p easily bearable. I'll look up the white noise machine I was using if you want.

Some examples: turns the volume up way too loud when watching screens. Talks loudly in normal conversations. Has speech difficulties. Doesn’t always respond when you call his name or talk to him - you have to get his attention visually or tap him on the shoulder sometimes. He definitely struggles in noisy environments, but not only in them. He has also flat-out said that he has trouble hearing. I also should mention that he did have meningitis at about a month old, but made a full recovery and no one ever told us that hearing loss could be a result long-term. We found that out recently when doing our own research. 

We’re seeing his pediatrician to follow up, but what should we ask for next? His doc is great and will get us referrals for whatever we ask for, but I don’t even know where to go from here. I read some things about tests that can be done for hidden hearing loss - is that a thing in young kids?

I had an... interesting... exchange with someone on the librarian sub I frequent this past weekend and wanted to see what you all think. Am I overreacting to be upset with this person's response to my post? To try to be as brief as possible, I posted a vent about a library patron who rolled her eyes and tried to get a coworker to help her instead of me, because I didn't hear her when she spoke to me and asked her to repeat herself. As you know, this kind of thing happens all the time, but for whatever reason it just happened to get under my skin, so I blew off steam by posting to the sub. 99% of the people who commented were sympathetic, and a few fellow HOH librarians shared their own similar experiences. It all ended up being very lighthearted and made me feel 1000% better immediately. Then there was this person, lol. (She is NOT hearing impaired.) A few highlights from their comment(s):

""Patron could have some issue of her own. Sometimes, we can't see beyond our own struggles to see someone else struggling, too. This could apply to both of you.""

""I have a parent who is deaf and at least two other family members who just plain don't listen to me. I may get stabby (jk) with the next person who asks me to repeat myself.""

""I personally don't think I'd force a patron to work with me if they were uncomfortable even if their discomfort was unjustified, like they were blatantly racist or something.""

And then my favorite, as posted in the title. Again, this person is not hearing impaired, but this is her response to me saying that due to my hearing loss, I sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves:

""it's my job to lean in and listen harder, not their job to speak up""

Like, wow! That's all it takes?? Damn, these hearing aids were just money down the drain! 

LOL, by now I am definitely seeing the humor in how absolutely clueless she is coming off, but I'm posting here both as another vent, and to ask for y'all opinions... is there anything I'm missing in the exchange that has validity? For context, here is the original post and commentary:

Even some teachers asked sometimes if i had not good hearing... I was often in front of class due to this.

Did you have similar experiences?

[댓글]
I definitely wish I hadn't waited as long as I did. 

I was first diagnosed at age 18 and tried a hearing aid then but didn't really need it and so returned it. My hearing loss is degenerative, however, and by my mid twenties I really could have benefited from hearing aids, but didn't actually get them until I started being functionally deaf in some environments when I was 30. It took an employer (very gently and politely) asking if maybe I needed hearing aids after there was a meeting where I full stop could not understand a single thing the client was saying.

I do, I found out two years ago that I have two different genetic conditions that cause deafness. In junior high school I went to a doctor for hearing problems and was blown off. I knew there was something wrong. But, I was told I was ok. I’ve become fairly good at reading lips. 
However, if I had gotten the help I needed then- hearing aids, ASL etc. my life would be better now.

I had a hearing aid.  I refused to wear it.  Partly because it was uncomfortable but also because I was in denial.  

I wish I had worn it more.  In hindsight I always had difficulties caused by it and I was in denial of those difficulties, too.  Only when it got so bad as to be completely undeniable did I accept where things are, in my 20s.

It made me introverted and awkward.  Yes.

I've had single side deafness dye to the mumps since I was about 4. I'm currently 50. Over the years somewhere my hearing side declined.  I finally got my hearing aids 3 days ago.  I really wish I would have had them as a child. I feel like everything would be different if I was able to understand what people were saying back then. I think people wouldn't have thought i was just aloof and stuck up when I didn't answer them because I just didn't hear them.  Also I think I would have likely been less shy.

I have a genetic defect. Hearing aids are like 8gs and i work where I'm constantly wearing a respirator and other miscellaneous ppe; I'd probably lose them even if they were affordable. I hate that the coverage on hearing is like $500 a year, you can't accumulate it. I guess I've just accepted saying 'what' a lot.
I can also sleep through anything so there's that.

I don't. Let me explain why.

I was diagnosed with hearing loss when I was 5. But I was so ashamed of wearing hearing aids back then, since I was bullied for my weight and I thought this would be another reason for bullying. Plus, the doctor didn't believe it: I was successful academically, which didn't align with the doctor's idea that I should be bad academically. 

6 years later, another doctor said that I had to get hearing aids now (age 11). So I get hearing aids, but life still ain't better: classmates are jealous (not because of hearing aids, for something else), so even though I can hear, I wasn't socially ""in the class"".

7 years later, and finally, people were seeing my hearing aids less of a nuisance and more of a ""oh, that's fine"" thing.

Update: thank you very much to everyone who replied , I already got the people I needed , but stay tuned since I see this forum is active and I will announce future help needed and community activities related to audiology also! 



Hi everyone! I’m a first year audiology student, and for one of my classes, I need to complete 2 questionnaires with someone who suspects they have hearing loss or has been diagnosed with it. Unfortunately, I don’t know anyone personally, so I’m reaching out here in case someone is willing to help. It would really mean a lot thank you in advance!

I jave hearing loss and would love to help you

👋👋👋

Would love to participate. I am a late 30s pilot detected with asymmetrical hearing loss. Got family history from dad's side, so this was expected. Unfortunately I don't have the numbers yet, of your questionnaire required that. I was checked at an Air Force hospital of my country and they send the reports directly to the civil aviation authority.

1madpw8,hardofhearing,"Progressive Hearing Loss – Looking for Advice, Support, or Shared Experiences","Kia ora everyone,
I’m (nearly 30F) from New Zealand and I’ve been coming to terms with a progressive hearing loss that I only noticed a couple of years ago (2023), when I was about 27.
I’ve now had three audiograms over the past three years (screenshots attached), and they show a significant drop over time, especially in the high frequencies. So far there’s no clear cause.

I’ve been wearing hearing aids since 2023 (Oticon Jet2 mini rte), which help in some ways but not in all situations and I’m starting to feel frustrated by my hearing. I’m also starting to worry a bit about what’s coming next for me, whether my hearing will keep declining, if I’ll end up needing cochlear implants, or how this will affect my work and life long-term. I’m also starting to wonder whether I’m doing enough or seeing the right professionals.

Have any of you been through something similar? What helped you in the long term and short term? What should I be doing now to make sure I’m prepared or supported?
Any thoughts, advice, insight, or shared experiences would mean a lot.

[댓글]
It certainly wouldn’t hurt to seek second opinions, because hearing loss can be reversed in some cases. This is too easy, but I don’t suppose you were treated with an antibiotic like gentamicin? Did you have anything else going on when you started noticing your hearing decline? Any other symptoms?

Ah that sucks. I'm sorry you're facing this at such a young age. No real advice, but I'd be pushing for an explanation if possible. Though given its bilateral, I suspect they will chalk it up to 'genetic.'

Hi! Not a doctor not an expert here just another person going through something a bit similar. I had a mild-moderate loss as a child but it was stable. In my late 20s it started worsen. Now severe.

Noise exposure could explain that kind of loss but it would be very extreme at your age. As could various types of toxicity (another user mentioned antibiotics). But a genetic or developmental condition - structural malformation of the inner ear that leaves it prone to injury or harm over time - is also possible.

You need a diagnosis for underlying reason. See an ENT. See more than one. Get imaging done. I've had CTs and MRIs of my head.

The cochlea has a structure where parts of it can be damaged or prone to damage but other parts of it physically preserved and have normal anatomy. That often corresponds to loss at high, mid or low frequencies.

So while you may continue to lose your hearing depending on the underlying cause you may also keep your low frequency hearing like you have quite stably for a long time, maybe the rest of your life.

With lipreading (which can be trained) if you retain even a little bit of residual low frequency hearing, like you seem to be, it is very likely you will continue to be able to understand speech with the assistance of lipreading.

Your high frequency loss may cause issues with understanding speech without lipreading. This is why you are struggling now.

Your hearing aids are the type that can do speech remapping I believe. Make sure your audiologist has that on. (It takes parts of the high frequency speech sounds and just translates them into low frequency sounds you would be able to hear.)

Cochlear implants tend to provide high frequency information. The question is not just will you need a cochlear implant but also are you even eligible to receive one. You still need nerves able to respond to the CI signals. If you once had normal hearing, then if the vestibulocochlear nerve (the auditory nerve) is intact, a CI is maybe an option. Today it is sometimes possible to preserve the hearing in one part of the cochlea while inserting a CI So it's possible you might hear better than now with a CI while having some natural hearing remaining.

I investigated CIs almost obsessively when I realized my hearing was worsening over time but it's been 20 years and I still don't feel I would benefit from one. But I sometimes think by my 50s I probably will need one and it's frustrating and I grieve a bit there's a big emotional component to all this that's very hard.

Good luck :) Walking down the same path of threshold of intelligibility right now myself at ~75% word reception. I cannot really learn new words by sound anymore. Too many things I can't differentiate. If I don't know the word it has to be spelled out for me. That and confidently mishearing things.

I don’t have any insights unfortunately, but I’m going through something similar and doctors have not found a cause. I’m awaiting a third opinion in a couple of weeks time. Lost some hearing in my left ear when I was 32. It then progressed to my right ear. I’m now severely deaf in both ears. I have no idea what the cause is. No one in my family seems to have a hearing issue, I’m not aware of taking any antibiotics that would cause it, and I’ve not been exposed to excessive noise. The only thing I have responded to when my hearing suddenly drops is prednisone. However, the effect does not last. My first ENT suspected an auto immune issue, however, another ENT said they didn’t think it was that.

1ma5uoo,hardofhearing,NEED HELP AND ADVICE FOR A CHARACTER I'M WRITING WHO'S HOH.,"NOT TYPING LIKE THIS TO YELL I'M LEGALLY BLIND, AND EVEN THOUGH MY BOOKS/STORIES WOULDN'T USE THIS CAPS, I USE IT FOR MY BENEFIT. (AND YES, I KNOW OTHER METHODS TO MAKE THE TEXT EASIER TO SEE, BUT THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL CHOICE, SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT, THANK YOU.) ALSO, I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY GRAMMAR OR SPELLING ERRORS IN ADVANCE, AS THOSE AREN'T MY STRONG SUITS.

ALSO, PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF THIS IS A LONG POST OR IF ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS SEEM STUPID OR EVEN ABILIST OR DOWNRIGHT CRUEL IN ANY WAY. SINCE I AM DESPERATELY TRYING TO AVOID WRITING STEREOTYPES/MISINTERPRETATIONS ABOUT CHARACTERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH THINGS I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH.

P.S. PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I'VE ASKED THESE BEFORE. THANK YOU.

FOR CONTEXT, ELLIE (NICKNAME FOR MY HOH CHARACTER), IS THE ADULT STEP-DAUGHTER OF A RICH FAMILY AND HER STEP SISTER IS THE FAVORITE, AND WHILE ELLIE ISN'T PSHYCIALLY NEGLECTED, THERE'S STILL SOME EMOTIONAL DAMAGE TO SAY THE LEAST.

NOW, QUESTION 1, CAN IT BE REALISTIC FOR HER ONLY TO HAVE TO USE ASL (AS SHE'S VERBAL BUT STILL LEARNED IT AS A KID DESPITE HER STEP-FAMILY IS INSISTING SHE SPEAK, HER REAL DAD IS HOH TOO), SO COULD SHE HAVE LEARNED IT FROM HIM?

ALSO QUESTION 2: CAN IT MAKE SENSE FOR HER ONLY TO USE ASL WHEN HER HEARING AIDS ARE DYING/DEAD/NOT WORKING RIGHT?

QUESTION 3: I'M NOT TRYING TO ASK PPL TO WRITE MY CHARACTER FOR ME, I JUST...DON'T WANNA MAKE ANYONE IN THE DEAF/HOH COMMUNITY ANGRY WITH MISINTERPRETATIONS EITHER. SO, BARRING THAT, I'M ASKING/SAYING THESE NEXT THINGS TO BE SAFE. I HAD SOME PEOPLE SAY DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THIS NEXT SITUATION, WHICH I'LL GET TO IN A BIT.

BUT IT'S THE MAIN REASON WHY I'M POSTING THIS, JUST TO ENSURE I GET MORE ANSWERS BEFORE I MAKE THE FINAL CHOICE. ENSURING I'M DOING THINGS RIGHT. ANYWAY, FOR ***MORE*** CONTEXT, ELLIE IS GONNA GO TO A HEARING TEST APPOINTMENT AT SOME POINT IN THE STORY, (THIS ISN'T HER FIRST ONE SHE'S DONE THS HER WHOLE LIFER RPETTY MUCH) AND EVERYONE AROUND HER KNOWS IT.

&amp; SHE'S ALSO GETTING READY TO GET NEW HEARING AIDS. (I KNOW THEY'LL TAKE A WHILE TO COME IN). NOW, SHE FINDS OUT DURING THIS THAT HER ""WORSE"" EAR HAS GOTTEN WORSE HEARING WISE.

NOW HERE'S WHERE THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES COME IN: (AGAIN, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE HER LOOK WEAK, OR ""POOR PITIFUL ME"" OR MAKE THE DEAF COMMUNITY LOOK BAD). BUT FOR CONTEXT ON HER HEARING: SHE HAS HIGH-FREQUENCY SNHL-(SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS), (POSSIBLY INHERITED FROM HER REAL DAD).

NOW...MY ORIGINAL INTENTION FOR THE HEARING TEST SCENE WAS TO HAVE ELLIE UPSET AFTER SEEING THE RESULTS, IN A ""IT'S WORSE, OH GOD I KNEW IT!"" KIND OF WAY. (MIND U JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR, JUST BECAUSE SHE WAS UPSET, DIDN'T MEAN I WANTED TO MAKE HER UPSET ABOUT HER DEAFNESS AS A WHOLE, I WANTED TO GIVE HER STRENGTH, EVEN IF IT'S QUIET STRENGTH).

BUT DURING THIS VERSION, SHE EVEN CRIES A BIT, MAINLY WHEN SHE'S ALONE WITH A FRIEND SHE'S COMFORTABLE WITH. ANYWAYS, I HAD SOMEONE TELL ME ON ANOTHER FORUM THAT THIS WAS DISENGENIOUS, AND SHE SHOULD JUST BE LIKE: ""OH WELL IT'S ANOTHER DAY."" IN A SORTS.

SO I'M THINKING OF CHANGING IT. 'CAUSE THEY SAID IT'D BE ABIELST AND RAGE INDUCING EPSEICLALY SICNE ITS TREATED AS SUDDEN DESPTIE ELLIE KNOWING IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE. A SYMPATHY PLEA.

SO I'M THINKING TO CHANGE THIS: 1 SHE ACTS JUST AS THEY SUGGESTED AND ISN'T BOTHERED BY IT, AS THE PERSON ABOVE SUGGESTED.

2 ELLIE ***IS UPSET,*** BUT NOT ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS, MORESO ON HOW HER FAMILY (MAINLY HER STEP DAD AND SIS) AND HOW THEY ARE GONNA REACT, MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT OF HER NEEDING NEW HEARING AIDS, AND HOW ""EXPENSIVE"" THE ""ADDONS"" ARE (IN HER STEPDADS WORDS, NOT UNDERSTANDING SHE BEING BENEFITED FROM THINGS LIKE WATERPROOFING AND BLUETOOTH CAPABILITIES).

PLUS I'LL SHOW HER STEP SISTERS ABUSE/RUDE COMMENTS (MAINLY ON ""WASITING MOENY"" ON HER ""BAD"" EAR I'M ALSO GONNA HINT AT HER HYPOCRISY TOO BUT THAT'S KIND OF BESIDE THE POINT).

BOTTOM LINE: IT COULD SHOW THEIR DYSFUNCTION AGAIN. OR IS THIS STEP FAMILY DRAMA, INSULTING TO REAL DEAF/HOH PPL AND AM I WRITING SOMETHING...TOO DRAMATIC? OR EVEN IN A NON-REALISTIC ""OH POOR PITIFUL ELLIE,"" TYPE OF WAY?

SORRY IF ANY OF THE OFFENDINGS ANYONE, I AIN'T TRYING TO BE RUDE, JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT, HELL I KNOW I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE BUT...I'LL WANT MORE INFO ON MORE DEAF/HOH PEOPLE'S OPINIONS, AGAIN, I'M JUST TRYING TO ENSURE I'M DOING THINGS RIGHT. PLEASE FORGIVE ANY GRAMMAR/SPELLING ERRORS IF ANY ARE PRESENT.

She would only use asl with others who are deaf/hoh






how she reacts to the results of her audiogram is subjective. There will be deaf/hoh people who aren’t bothered by the results and those who found their results to be upsetting. There’s no easy way to do and that’s just part of choosing to write a disabled character. 






I will say I’m interested as to why you’re writing about a deaf character instead of blind/visually impaired person when you are visually impaired.

I AM GOING TO TYPE LIKE THIS SO IT IS EASIER FOR YOU TO READ! 

I STARTED TO LOSE MY HEARING (ALSO GENETICS RELATED) WHEN I WAS IN 3RD GRADE, AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO HAVE SURGERY OR HEARING AIDS. WHEN I FINALLY WENT BACK TO THE AUDIOLOGIST 20 YEARS LATER, I CRIED SEEING HOW MUCH WORSE MY HEARING HAD GOTTEN. I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY FAIR TO BE UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT WAS NOT SHOCK BUT IT WAS JUST REALLY UPSETTING FOR ME BECAUSE I KNEW I COULD NO LONGER IGNORE THE PROBLEM MY DAD IGNORED. I FOUND OUT ONLY THEN THAT HE HAD THE SAME HEARING LOSS AND WORE HEARING AIDS --BUT HE HID THEM. HIS GENERATION ( HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HIS 90S IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY ) HAD A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF DISABILITY AND ACCEPTANCE FROM TODAY. OR EVEN THE NEXT TWO GENERATIONS AFTER HIM. 

THE SITUATION YOU DESCRIBE IS A FORM OF ABUSE BY THE STEP DAD AND STEP SISTER. IT MAY BE A FORM OF FINANCIAL ABUSE. IT IS CERTAINLY A FORM OF GENERAL ABUSE, THOUGH, TO ONLY ALLOW HER TO HAVE THE BARE MINIMUM, MOCK OR TEASE HER ABOUT HER HEARING AIDES. I HAD TO GET A CHEAPER MODEL AND IT WINDS UP COSTING MORE IN THE LONG RUN; I WOULD HAVE RATHER HAD ONES THAT I COULD RE-CHARGE INSTEAD OF NEEDING LOTS AND LOTS OF TINY LITTLE BATTERIES THAT ONLY LAST A DAY IF THAT. MY REASON WAS SIMPLY COST WITH LACK OF INSURANCE. COMMON PROBLEM IN THE US. 

I DO NOT THINK THIS IS TOO DRAMATIC. NOT NECESSARILY UN-REALISTIC. 

WHEN IT COMES TO USE OF ASL YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO ORALISM. IT'S REALLY HORRIBLE, BUT A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HISTORY TO LEARN ABOUT. THEN CONSIDER HOW YOUR CHARACTER FEELS ABOUT THIS AND HOW THEY HAVE REACTED. SINCE WE KNOW YOUR CHARACTER IS ORAL AT HOME, CONSIDER IF SHE WAS IN MAINSTREAM SCHOOLING (WHERE LEARNING ASL WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE), OR IF SHE WENT TO A SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. CONSIDER HER FRIENDS AND HOW THE INTERACT WITH HER. 

AND HONESTLY, WHEN IT COMES TO ROLE PLAY FORUM ADMINS ( AS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE FACING SOME OF THOSE ) THEY CAN BE THE ABSOLUTE WORST ABOUT DEAF CHARACTERS IN GENERAL. I HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN REALLY WEIRD FEEDBACK FOR MY DEAF AND HOH CHARACTERS, AND IT CAN BE PARTICULARLY OFF-PUTTING TO DEAL WITH, HONESTLY. I THINK THAT MOST ADMINS DO NOT KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS CAPITAL D-DEAF OR HOH SO THEY STRUGGLE WITH THE IDEA OF A CHARACTER LIKE THAT. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNDERREPRESENTATION IN THE MEDIA TO HELP ABLED PEOPLE GRASP THAT DISABILITY EXISTS. I KNOW THAT THE LAST LEGALLY BLIND ROLE PLAYER I MET OFTEN HAD TROUBLE WITH ADMINS ACCUSING THEM OF NOT REALLY BEING BLIND BECAUSE THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF REALITY WHEN IT COMES TO DISABILITY. 

MUCH LUCK WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND STORIES!

When my bad ear showed signs of decline at a recent hearing test I got more support than ever before and felt vindicated because I had been saying there was a bigger problem and nobody seemed to really take it seriously. Suddenly things happened and I was thrilled. I got positive outcomes. My family were also thrilled for me. I use my aid less now and gear far more due to other treatments after a decade of daily hearing aid use. 

The wearing of aids was so fatiguing for me that less use was awesomely freeing. 

The diagnosis of worsening hearing was not a shock though. I knew. I lived with it every day so I don’t know if many HOH people would be shocked. Very subjective. Make your call. Have your character speculate about whether other people feel that way or what she’s feeling is isolated as an outcome.

Hey! My name is actually Ellie lol so I already love your story! Before I answer your questions, I want to preface this by saying i am severely hard of hearing, I do use a hearing aid, but I can still hear a little without, and beat with earbuds. Also want to preface, I DO NOT KNOW ASL. Here’s my take.

Question 1: Realistically no. She can do ASL while she’s speaking English, but I do believe in this world she would be verbal. 

Question 2: Yes, especially growing up in a HoH family. This would also enforce the fluidity in her language. It would also indicate to the readers themselves when she is unable to hear. 

Question 3: when I got my results, I was internally crushed. It is not a bad thing to want to be “normal” in today’s society. It is also not a bad thing to just be who you are. I knew that my hearing was getting worse, but getting confirmation changed things for me. It felt more real, especially as a fresh adult (25). I was upset because I knew that was my future, and that’s okay. It’s not ableist whether you’re the disabled one feeling that way. I wasn’t upset that I’m deaf, I wasn’t upset that it got worse. I was upset that I have to hold the weight of this loss with me my entire life and it really won’t get any easier. I cried too. It should never be a “oh well it’s another day” type thing as hearing loss is such a heavy and lonely burden to carry. Also, the family being upset because of how expensive they are, isn’t dramatic at all, it’s real. There are families out there that treat their HoH kids that way. To them, it’s just another reason they have to hold all of that weight on their shoulders themselves. 

I love all of your questions and I’m sure no matter where you go with this, it will be great. Can’t wait to read it!",2025-07-26 22:12:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ma5uoo/need_help_and_advice_for_a_character_im_writing/

1m9kiwp,hardofhearing,Do the amplifier problems I'm having occur in hearing aids?,"I went to my audiologist two weeks ago and about to see my ENT in September. In my audiology appointment, I found out I am hard of hearing in my left ear starting at the 500hrz range, pretty much going downhill from there. I have never had hearing aids before so this is all new to me and I don't know what to expect.

I understand the difference between hearing aids and amplifiers, but I thought of trying an amplifier first as they are cheaper than hearing aids so I can see if I should go the hearing aid route (saving money).

With the amplifier I'm getting a constant hiss and I have to change the volume for different circumstances such as being able to hear talking vs listening to the TV or radio. Is this a amplifier problem? Would I experience this with actual hearing aids?

I'm looking into elehear hearing aids as a cheaper alternative to aids prescribed by my doctor. Does anyone know if I'd be able to use my hearing test graph to set them to the right settings, or at least be able to send a copy to the company?

chat gpt isn't a trained audiologist, nor does it actually ""know"" anything. it just pulls information and buzzwords from other sources. it has a documented history of being incorrect and sharing wrong information, and research has shown using chat gpt diminishes people's brain function and critical thinking skills. also, it does horrible harm to the environment on a massive scale. do not use chat gpt to analyze your audiogram! it doesn't know what it's doing!

I can’t imagine a reason I would do that honestly. The audiologist goes over the results and answers questions.

I would be careful about using the word ""educated"" in conjunction with Chat GPT's guesses as that is really all the output is.

Try it and see what happens.  Report back here.

this is a terrible idea.

I did use gpt to read out the audiogram, but not for analysis like that. And I have to say, by the time you're done fact checking it, you could have done your own analysis. It was wrong reading the audiogram about 30 percent of the time and I ended up writing in the db/HL, and freq on my own to produce a curve for an equalizer. 

It was painful. I'm not gonna lie. But after a LOT of messing around, I got it to work. This was just a pet project and something I was willing to invest time and nuisance into. 

GPT is not a doctor, not medical in any way. It can only really regurgitate what it's given, and for my application, fine. For yours, I... doubt you'll have a good time with it and the chance for incorrect translation are pretty high.

1m7rh3t,hardofhearing,Assessments used for Language comprehension,"My brother has been deaf since birth. When he was 3-6 years old, my parents tried Auditory-Verbal Therapy (which focuses on lip-reading and using hearing aids). However, they later realized he wasn't progressing in school because he was unable to understand or recollect sentences. Tragically, they stopped his therapy, and he didn't receive any other special needs educational support.

My parents weren't able to get him a correct diagnosis for what might be a learning disability, so they weren't able to support him effectively. He is now in his late 30s and has the vocabulary and reading comprehension of a first-grader. He heavily relies on his family for simple things, like filling out a form or talking to the store keeper.

I recently moved to the US and started learning about other forms of therapy, like AAC or resuming auditory-verbal therapy. I'm wondering if these could help him communicate better and improve his comprehension.

To start, I think my first steps should be:

1. Work with a specialist to evaluate his current comprehension.
2. Find resources that can help us support him better.

Does anyone have advice on how to approach this? Thanks in advance.

Does he have health insurance? If he doesn't already have a pcp (primary care provider), then you need to look up in network providers and get one. They will do an initial health exam and hello to set up referrals to the correct people. Probably: an ENT, speech language pathologist, a neurologist, and neuropsychologist.

There probably are state level departments that help with adults who have special needs. The names can be different between states, so you would need to find that out. The doctors office should be able to help with this referrals as well

How deaf is he? Enough that to achieve total communication, sign language has also been tried?

The UK and I wear hearing aids. 

At work we are required to wear various PPE/safety equipment including a hard hat and eye protection.

My problem is that wearing hearing aids under a hard hat is uncomfortable as the hat sits right on top of my ears (and by extension, my hearing aids) and causes constant whistling from them. 

The default eye protection we are provided is safety glasses, which make the problem even worse as they also need to sit on top of my ears/hearing aids, causing the hard hat to push down on both of them painfully.

Has anyone else found reasonable solutions to this problem or know of any safety equipment that can better accommodate the wearing of hearing aids with hard hats and eye protection?

I had a company buy the 3M Peltor hardhat earmuffs.

I wear IsoTunes Aware earbuds instead of my hearing aids. The “Aware” feature involves a mic that provides adjustable amplification (enough for me anyway) while blocking loud sounds.

One goes around the arm of your glasses, the other around the processor of the hearing aid, giving you more options to position the processor and hold them there. Might help you keep them out of the way of the hard hat rim!

1m7gy5d,hardofhearing,Early intervention for 4 month old,"My LO was diagnosed with single sided hearing loss in the right ear. Is early intervention worth it? Left ear is perfectly healthy and normal. Doctor has no concerns for speech and language development. Be brutally honest

[댓글]
I am a school-aged teacher for the deaf and hard of hearing, and early intervention is ABSOLUTELY worth it! not just for your child, but for the family. you would be surprised at how educationally impactful unilateral hearing loss can be. difficulties hearing in background noise, struggles with localizing speech, hearing what people say on the ""deaf"" side, just to name a few. with early intervention, you will learn strategies for teaching, communication, and advocacy. early intervention now may mean no or less academic intervention during school

&gt;Is early intervention worth it?

You say ""worth it."" What is it going to cost you or your 4 month old? What is it going to cost if there are speech and language development problems and you don't get early intervention?

The consequences of speech and language development problems can affect a child through their entire lives. That is not even considering other implications of having single sided hearing loss. SSHL can affect localization of sounds, it can reduce their incidental learning which is where babies pickup most of their language, and early interventions can help in identifying what educational supports the child may need when they do get to a school setting.

Early intervention identifies the struggles the child may face, and minimizes those impacts by coming up with a plan to support the student with, and educate the child on how to deal with those struggles.

Basically, ask yourself and your partner (if you have one) what are the downsides of accepting early interventions?

Yes. 1000% no question. EI is largely the child getting therapy with the therapist and the parents learning what to do between sessions to support their child's development. You will be getting tailored 1:1 support and advice. 

They will keep a more acute eye on development than a pediatrician would and can help direct you to resources specific for Deaf/HOH. If they have ASL classes, then I'd take them up on that too.

Well if drs have no concerns about speech or language that’s good. “Is early intervention worth it?” Obviously. Depending on the level of loss they will need a hearing aid. That’s can be challenging for very young kids as they don’t always want to wear them but hearing aids work best when worn the majority of the day. 


You will likely need to make their school aware so they can receive the proper support but honestly that’s way in the future

1m74lrs,hardofhearing,Im a teenager and have been hard of hearing in my left ear since I was 8 or 9.,"Hello! new to the sub! how u doing? 

Did you guys learn signlanguage? I learnt the alphabet most and I enjoy teaching my friends and family how to sign, along witht the occasional club of kids.

  
I lost some of my hearing due to having been sick a lot and stuff as a little kid I have sensorineural hearing loss(I think). I admit that I dont know where my hearing aid is at the moment! But im working on finding it.

I use signlanguage to remember the alphabet, teach others, talk to otherrs and sometimes communicate with friends in class.

”He can locate sound” is totally irrelevant and why hearing people cause us so much pain and misery.

Hearing sounds does not mean the sound is clear nor that speech is easy to comprehend. You should rather be looking for if he communicates differently in quiet situations where he can see the speaker and the distance is close, compared to if he truly catches everything in social situations with a lot of overlapping speakers and background noise. People often asses our ability to hear by the first situation, while the second one is much much more important for our relationship with hearing people. 

Is he really as engaged in conversations when there is background noise, or do the conversations become shorter and not as deep? Does he become tired from listening? Do people accuse him for not paying attention? When our cognition can’t to the hard task of listening anymore, then we zone out and people think we’re nonchalant for not being socially involved. We can often hear things if we focus actively, but have lost the ability to listen passively and still comprehend sound.

Hearing aids can amplify sound, but not make the sound clearer.

With mild hearing loss, we often get by fine with hearing aids. We just get very tired from compensating and from the effort of listening.

With moderate hearing loss, there will be some occasions where we do struggle, but hearing people will believe things work fine, because we do hear well in quiet conditions at short distances with hearing aids.

With severe hearing loss, we do hear tons of things with hearing technology. But it’s too much sound. We hear everything, but it’s super hard to interpret anything. People still believe we cope well, because together with lip-reading and guessing, we seem so hearing to hearing people. In fact, we’re often weary excluded in social situations.

Never assess anyone by our hearing ability. Do compensate by a lot of visual communication regardless if it’s reading a lot or using sign language and similar. It’s great that we hear so much, but don’t have us compete with other based on our hearing ability. It’s not fair to say we hear fine, when we actually struggle to interpret what we hear.

I would agree with what others have said, sounds like your child is hard of hearing. It's easy for mild to moderate high frequency loss to fly under the radar during childhood, because they're likely not missing most speech sounds and they don't know certain things actually make sounds if they've never been able to hear those sounds. I have moderate high frequency HL that wasn't diagnosed until I was 12... I was just a quiet and anxious kid who talked a little funny and got overwhelmed in loud environments. People don't tend to associate those things with hearing loss. I didn't realize that ""birdsong"" wasn't a poetic way of talking about birds clicking (that's all I could hear them do), that bells are actually pretty loud, or that fans make any noise at all. It was assumed that my loss was due to antibiotic ototoxicity, since I had a long course of treatment for tuberculosis as a young toddler.

I don't know much about the frequency of adenoids/etc affecting hearing, but we did explore that possibility with my oldest child. They had hearing loss that our ENT thought was related to adenoids/eustachian tube dysfunction/recurrent ear infections, but after treating all of those issues a hearing loss very similar to mine remained. Then I had two more children, neither of whom had ear or adenoid issues, both with similar hearing loss from birth/very young. Now all of our HL is assumed to be genetic, although we've had genetic testing that didn't identify any of the most common genetic variants linked to hearing loss. Unfortunately sometimes we just don't have the knowledge or technology to figure out why the body does what it does.

All of that to say that you don't need to know exactly why your child has hearing loss to treat that hearing loss. I have big regrets for waiting to get my oldest hearing aids for as long as we did. There were years when they could have had much better language access, but we were advised to hold off to see if this surgery, that course of antibiotics, this additional surgery, etc fixed the issue. If I could go back I would have asked about HAs and incorporated more sign language immediately.

Please follow through with their recommendations for therapy and austerity devices, like a hearing aid. They are going to start school soon and there is so much more stimuli there. They will become exhausted, could have difficulty learning and socializing. 

I recommend talking with the hospital's social worker or looking up Deaf resources in your state so that you can start learning about supports, resources  and how to navigate 504 &amp; iep, should he end up needing one. 

Not following through would be like not giving it child glasses who failed a vision screening because they don't bump into things and can match colors.

I made it all the way to kindergarten before anyone noticed I had hearing loss. The reason likely is because interacting with your parents is different than in the classroom. Your parents are giving you 100% attention, looking right at you, etc. In the classroom I was put in the back because I was tall. There's so much other noise because of the other kids. It's just harder to hear in a classroom setting.



The good news is this probably means your child's hearing loss is correctable with hearing aids. I've been wearing them 40 years now, and the tech we have today is pretty amazing. Also make sure and get the insurance on them. They will get broken, dunked in water, etc.

Hearing loss is a spectrum. You son ""failing"" his hearing test means that his responses were below what would be considered ""normal"". The audiologist indicated that the loss is mostly in the high frequencies meaning that your son's hearing within the other frequencies may well be within the normal range (without an audiogram it is difficult to comment). You also do not mention the extent of his hearing loss is it mild, moderate?

Search for the speech banana and compare to your son's audiogram so you can get an understanding of the sounds he may have been missing and how he has seemingly been able to function without any outward indicators of HL. HL is an invisible disability and children are more resilient and adaptable than we think. I know of a family whereby the parents did not know their son was deaf in one ear until he was 10! Apparently, like your son, he was functioning seemingly normally. One day, by accident, they asked him to answer the phone using the other ear and that's how it came out! Their son thought everyone was deaf in one ear!

I also wonder what you are experiencing as a parent when you seek alternative explanations for your son's HL. Of course, it is good practice, if there are options out there you want them explored. Obviously it is a shock to you and your wife. How his diagnosis and experience with medical and other support professionals are managed will be key in your son being comfortable with his HL or not

I’m completely deaf in one ear (can’t use a hearing aid) and close to 30 years old, and it’s only been just recently that I’ve realized how much hearing loss does affect me. Because I still have one ear with total hearing, no one really looked into anything further because I could hear most stuff fine.

Your child can still be deaf or hard of hearing even if they still can hear most things. I really wish that there was more guidance for me growing up. I would have benefited so much if I wasn’t just thrown into the world as a “normal kid who might ask ‘what?’ a few times”. Sign language, subtitles, and just more understanding of the situation would have made an insane difference for me growing up. I’m just starting to take advantage of these things now and it’s made a world of a difference. 

When I started living on my own and used subtitles for the first time on a movie I’ve already watched and loved, I was amazed at how much I was missing that everyone else caught. Now when I’m watching a movie without subtitles, there is a clear difference in how exhausted I am. No wonder I’ve always been so burnt out after any event or social gathering - straining to listen is something I have to make an active effort to do, and it’s so draining. 

It’s also so isolating to be at a table of people and trying your hardest to listen to the conversation, but because you can’t hear them, you just smile and nod along having no idea what they’re talking about. The last time I visited my grandparent before he died, I could never hear any of his stories over everyone else also talking and laughing - and that’s something that really affects me to this day. Everyone else gets these lovely memories of my grandpa telling riveting stories, and I miss it even though I’m putting more effort into listening than anyone else at the table. I only hear about it down the grapevine from someone else, which isn’t the same. It’s very lonely when no one around you fully understands or tries to accommodate.  

Listen to your doctor, follow their guidance, and don’t try to convince yourself that your child is “normal” just because they can hear a majority of stuff that you do. Pretending like it isn’t an issue just makes the child feel isolated and unable to understand their struggles. There’s nothing wrong with being deaf, and giving your kid all the support and tools they need will help them tremendously!! Pretending it’s not happening doesn’t make your kid learn to hear better, it just makes things really difficult and confusing for them. 

Good luck on this journey and I hope you take some of the advice in the comments! I do applaud you for taking it seriously and continuing to go through the doctors and specialists even with your doubts. Your kid potentially being hard of hearing might be scary to you, but it will be normal for them. The sooner you come to accept this, the sooner they will be so much more comfortable and confident in themselves 💕

Caveat, not a doc: it's possible, but unlikely - your kid is probably hard of hearing. Some of the modern tests can tell the difference between an obstruction or fixable issue in the ear/nose/throat system and deafness, but this is something you need to clarify with the doctor. 

Deafness or hard of hearing-ness is a wide spectrum - you have people who have very minor deafness who function normally in 95% of situations, people who are hard of hearing and have issues with crowds but are otherwise fine, deaf people who can only hear via hearing aids/implants, and people who are 100% stone deaf. 

Based on what you're saying, your kid seems to be hard of hearing. Some folks are hard of hearing only at specific frequencies - I can't hear very low sounds but can otherwise hear most sounds with hearing aids, but I am more towards the deaf part of the spectrum.",2025-07-23 02:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m6xxpa/hearing_loss_in_children/

1m4z89y,hardofhearing,"Left Ear Deafness for 3 years, worsening: Thoughts, Experiences, Support?","Hey r/hardofhearing, 

I wanted to talk with some people who may have had similar experiences and get some input and feedback.

About 3+ years ago, I initially had a period of deafness and severe tinnitus in my left ear. This happened during a time I was moving into a new house. I had recently been bitten and scratched badly my partner and I's cat (maybe 5-7 teeth punctures, several scratches). The year before I had come down with COVID, and then about a month after moving into the new house I was going through some serious stress due to a breakup. The deafness and tinnitus eased up and I only heard an infrequent humming until about three months later.

I was on a work trip a few towns over staying overnight in a hotel. This was early Spring. I woke up in the morning and my ear was so deaf/muted, tinnitusy and my balance was thrown off. I immediately got tested for COVID, did not have it. Went to the doctors and they gave me prednisone. This would start the beginning of pattern of deafness/muteness/severe tinnitus for about a week or so, then a couple month period of moderate/low deafness and low to moderate tinnitus. I noticed it would happen more during work trip travel, but other times seemingly at random. 

Between then and now, I've gone to multiple ENTs, seen specialists, tried nose sprays, ear drops, allergy medications, the OTC for ear ringing (which never helped and is a scam IMO). The only thing that seems to help is prednisone. But at this point I feel I take way too much prednisone (a 7 day course about every two months over three years) and this most recent episode the tinnitus was so loud and the deafness so deep it feels like besides the choir of alarm squeals and ocean sounds the whole left side of my head and the space after is in a void. I don't experience vertigo or balance issues, and it never hurts nor do I feel pain. No one has ever given me an answer why its occurring, what could be swelling inside my ear, nothing. Just to track when it drops on Mimi was what the specialist. 

The audiology test I took last week had my left ear hearing drop into the 60 row from the 75-80 range it had been at. I feel like soon I won't have any hearing at all in my left ear and frustrated that it's been so many years without more clarity. 

 I wanted to know if anyone's had similar experiences, thoughts and ideas or steps, and how people cope with and remain positive during moments of frustration with hearing loss.

1m315pj,hardofhearing,"Found out that I'm HoH in early 30s, can't afford HAs","Hello everybody! 

Like the title says, I found out just before Christmas that I have mild/moderate hearing loss and am a candidate for hearing aids. I notice most of my hearing loss is conversational when there's background noise. Trying to have any type of conversation anywhere but a quiet room is exhausting. And even then, the tinnitus is overwhelming. 

My issue is that I can't afford the hearing aids. I'm in Canada and the hospital quoted me $4000. 

I applied for my provincial hearing aid program and was denied. My boyfriend makes decent money but has a mortgage and vehicle payment. The government takes his income into consideration for the program even though we've never claimed common law (apparently it goes by household income, not family income). 

Beltone quoted me at $2900+tax for their most basic set. 

I don't make enough to even try to save up for them. 

What do I do?? 

[댓글]
What province are you in? I’m in New Brunswick and found a local place that had government grants for hearing aid users needing them to be gainfully employed! Could try that route, if you have a local deaf and hard of hearing society they may have a lead on where you could go!

I don’t know much about Canada, but do you have a Costco? They don’t do the tinnitus masking there, but they sell really nice hearing aids for much less than most other places, worth looking into.

You need to find a way to save for them. There’s not really many other options. You can always try other providers of hearing aids but there’s no guarantee they will be cheaper. Look in to financial aid programs too

I've just bought the Apple Airpods for $400 (AUD). You can program them by uploading an audiogram and they will adjust the settings to account for your losses. Not quite as good as HAs but possibly a stopgap?

I don't know about Newfoundland but in BC I got my audiologist to complete forms for me stating that I needed hearing aids in order to work and WorkBC paid for all but $500 of them. I'm not sure if Newfoundland has an equivalent though? I did some googling and it looks like worksupportnl.ca might be helpful.

This may or may not work for you.  I've been HOH since grade school, so a looooong time.  During the times I didn't have government support or health insurance that would pay for them I bought used HA (Hearing Aids) on ebay.  While I am in the U.S. I don't see why you can't find them in Canada.  The only issue to be careful of in my experience is to make sure you have an audiologist who can program them for you.  I had to pay for the initial Audiogram and then the programming.  I purchased several for $50 to $75 US and then had them programmed.  That way I always had a spare.  Then I found a repair service that I could mail them to for refurbishment if needed.  That service was often more than what I initially paid for the HA.  Even if you do find a way to get a new one or pair of new ones it would still be a good Idea to keep a spare just in case.

If you truly are desperate you might consider using wireless earbuds as hearing aids. Sometimes good enough is good enough.

Write a list of your symptoms. Bring it in the appointment. Make sure you say everything on the list. Don’t downplay your symptoms.

Writing everything down is a great suggestion. It's easy to get flustered and forget, etc.

my journey was a little different, at 16/17 i noticed i couldn’t hear out of my left ear, and i found out i had a hole in my eardrum and a cholesteatoma (a skin growth/“tumor”) and it ate away all 3 of my middle ear bones. i had 2 surgeries, one to repair my ear drum and remove the growth, and with the second one they replaced my middle ear bones with titanium which was supposed to help me regain some hearing. i ended up needing a hearing aid anyway (there was a low possibility of me not regaining much/any hearing, but that’s what ended up happening in my case). i knew what was going on and what the plan was, but i was still nervous. my advice would be to go forward with the exploration, they could potentially find the cause and be able to give you options going forward. there’s always a chance with surgery or medical intervention, you could regain hearing. there’s also the chance that if you don’t have the exploration, you could keep losing hearing overtime. hearing aids would probably be a great option for you either way! for me its definitely not the same as normal hearing but it helps so much in almost every situation. i hope they are able to find a solution for you, good luck!

I had middle ear surgery 3 months ago.I knew I had a retracted eardrum and eroded incus but also struggled with the whether to do surgery or just get hear aides.  I did a hearing aid trial and hated them. Decided on surgery. Had a CT scan in my local small town ordered by my surgeon in the big city. The CT report stated that all my ossicles were present and fine. Boy that made me confused. Went ahead with the exploration surgery and we were all surprised and what was found. My surgery was twice as long as planned. My eardrum had grown onto my facial nerve (chorda) and grown onto my stapes. My incus was completely gone. I have a titanium incus, bio design eardrum with a cartilage graft from behind my ear. The surgeon told me if I had not done the surgery it would have become much worse. My follow up yesterday showed hearing improvement in the mid range frequencies but the high frequency remained the same. I notice better hearing and sound location. After 3 months I finally got to go swimming (no diving) and it was pure heaven!!! I have to have follow up MRI scans to make sure nothing grows back. My surgeon said he wants all scans done in the big city.not my hometown because of the quality of the radiologist reading them. Hope that helps you decide. I do have nerve damage. Half of my tongue has no feeling or taste and the end of it has a burning/pins and needle sensation. Hoping it might come back. It is reasonable to get a second opinion.

Little update! Turns out I could have SCDS
I’m having CT and Vestibular testing to diagnose!
And if all is good and correct I suppose…I’ll be having surgery to correct!
Any tips are appreciated…very nervous

Update! Finally have closure!
I have Otosclerosis in both ears…waiting to be scheduled for surgery on my right one and will probably need surgery on my left one later on in life

1m2kbpl,hardofhearing,Explant after Infection,"

I have AB Naida Ultra Hi Res 3d 90 on the left side and had the Phonak Link M hearing aid on the left. It has been life changing but I decided to get the right side done.   During this new  implant surgery one lead went into semicircular canal. Of course we did not know that at the time. I had to use a walker because my balance was much worse. But ok. I’m old!  Went for activation and when my wonderful audiologist started to turn up the volume I shrieked and nearly fainted. Oh boy, everything stopped. No activation. Surgeon immediately ordered CT.   Had revision surgery. Incision started to drain almost  immediately the next day. Staphylococcus aureus infection. Doc tried to treat with Bactrim for six weeks. Still on it. He tried packing gauze/ antibiotic and debriding , still there. He said we could continue to try. I have felt sick, sweaty, weak this whole time. I said no. Let’s pull it. Surgery is tomorrow, then IV antibiotics 4-6 weeks, or more (haven’t seen that doc yet), maybe wait to heal )I don’t know), then hopefully reimplantation.

Btw, he thinks he will have to “ just pull the magnet” as cochlear is fine”, but after reading someone else post about the cochlear being infected (discovered during surgery) I’m going to make sure that he knows I want it all pulled if there is any indication that the cochlear area is infected.

Any advice? How will he know if cochlear part is infected?? It’s so CLOSE to my infected incision?   I’m scared. ",2025-07-17 21:44:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m2kbpl/explant_after_infection/

Honestly don't let it get you down. Being hard of hearing is one of those invisible disabilities, and it's easy for others to just assume you got it. 

Yeah it sucks and it's crappy of them to make that assumption, but unless you speak up and be 'that guy that says 'what' all the time', you're gonna have this happen more often than not, sadly.

It’s helped that I developed a willingness years ago to be the person who asks questions in an Explain it Like I’m 5 kind of way. Or, if I’m learning how to do a new thing, likes to take step-by-step notes. Here, I’d probably respond with something like, “hey, I saw that Project X was finished. I’m not up to speed yet on how it works, so it would be helpful for me if you would be willing to share your knowledge and experience and guide me through it next time.” And archive the request, in case a supervisor calls you out on it.

This happens with every professional who is hard of hearing. I am one such fellow myself. It's so frustrating being left out of office conversations, and people simply don't bother. It's not their fault - their social conditioning is like that. In this age of cutthroat competition, people have lost the human touch. Everyone is busy looking after their own interests, or rather, I must say, they are compelled to do so by the way things are.",2025-07-16 09:08:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m17sor/took_a_shot_at_my_confidence/

1m0uf47,hardofhearing,Solutions for directional hearing in games?,"I have very little hearing in my left ear, which is a very recent development. (Over the past year) and one of the biggest issues I've had is directional sound in video games. I've noticed a LOT of games don't have audio settings for mono-type sound, or directional subtitles, so I was wondering if anyone here had any solutions or tips. 

[댓글]
Newer video games generally have more accessibility options to help hh and deaf players.

I figured out how to turn mono audio on windows but if anyone has any programs or tips that would be amazing!

On Linux I uses easyeffects, on android I set balance to one side and use mono audio. 

Unfortunately, most FPS games do not include a visual audio indicator.  Fortnite does, so that's cool.

I know it sucks, man.  I had to give up Apex, was just too frustrating.  I play more RTS type games now.

Equalizer APO on the pc.

Take your latest audiogram and ask chat gpt to work it into a hearing curve for APO without peaking or clipping. It's time consuming but once you're set it, it'll adjust the audio for you. 

Not a perfect solution by any means, and takes a huge amount of tweaking, but once it's done, it's done and overlays that on top of any audio coming out of your computer. This adds challenges if it's a shared computer though, because it runs always.",2025-07-15 21:30:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m0uf47/solutions_for_directional_hearing_in_games/
1m0aa43,hardofhearing,hearing didn't really improve after tympanoplasty,"so I had the procedure done back in like September or November so you can count how many months that was. anyways my hearing hasn't improved compared to before my surgery. basically there was a big hole in my eardrum and that was why I couldn't hear well. after my surgery I had no complications or pain or anything unusual. I regained hearing and all that stuff. compared to my other ear, I still don't hear at the same level. I don't really know where to go from here lol?? I've gone back to the surgeon who did it multiple times and the last time might've been in May and he said it healed perfectly. so what do I do now? 😭

[댓글]
There could be built up scar tissue (from past infections/trauma or surgery) that is causing the hearing loss.

I think that's just how you hear now

Did the doctors say that it could bring hearing back because when I went for a consultation they said it would just stop my constant infections but not do anything hearing wise , was this the case for you?

i had a tympanoplasty and a surgery to removed a cholesteatoma that ate away my middle ear bones. they repaired my ear drum and gave me titanium middle ear bones. this was supposed to help me regain some hearing, but i regained so little it wasn’t even noticeable. i now wear a hearing aid in that ear. this could be a great option for you! it definitely isn’t “normal” hearing but it does help a lot in situations.

I have done myringoplasty on May. My hearing improved but not the same. doctors told me that it could be because of my existing condition. He asked to wait for 3 more months and see how it goes. Now my hearing reduce a bit than just after surgery. I am glad that there is no infection. For hearing, I just hope to improve further.",2025-07-15 06:17:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m0aa43/hearing_didnt_really_improve_after_tympanoplasty/
1m05e8c,hardofhearing,"Idk what to do, I’m going crazy","I think I'm broken or something. I've gone to two ENTs and had two appointments with the audiologist over three years. Nothing helps. Sure, I've learned to somewhat ignore the constant tinnitus in my ears but the pain is still there. Every day it randomly feels like something sharp is poking into my eardrum, and it hurts so bad. My ears always feel clogged like I'm on a plane, and music is almost always either too loud or muffled for me. Sometimes I feel dizzy (but it's not awful nor is it often). It gets worse when I have a cold. 

There is no fluid in my ears. My hearing is fairly normal (some minor hearing loss but nothing major). Took a scan of my head a couple years ago, that came out fine as well. 

I've stopped complaining about it at this point. I don't want to look like I'm making excuses to not do anything (I don't do that btw, but I've been feeling so drained lately). I even feel depressed from this madness, it's indirectly affecting my whole mood. I was completely fine three years ago, but then it suddenly started and never stopped. My mom offered to take me to the ENT again next week, I asked her what's the point? She's just going to tell me the same thing again, that I'm fine and to just take some Tylenol whenever it hurts. There is literally nothing wrong with me, but I'm in pain and I feel like a burden, a crazy person causing unnecessary stress to my family. 

I hate this so much. I'm a licensed scuba diver but I'm unable to enjoy diving because equalizing my ears feels like torture sometimes. I want to go to metal concerts without being in hell afterwards. I want to carry my baby sister and comfort her when she cries without feeling pain from the sound of her voice. My own mother's high pitched voice hurts my ears so easily and I feel like a terrible person for it. 

I hate this so much. I just want an end to this. Sometimes I feel like just putting some sort of vacuum into my ears and sucking whatever is causing me discomfort out.

Edit: I have TMJ!!!

[댓글]
Sorry to hear this. Sounds awful. I am no ENT and you should search for one that will work with you constructively (maybe one with dive medicine experience), but this sounds a lot like my earlier days with Eustachian tube dysfunction. Equalizing was intensely painful and I couldn’t always do it. (Now that I have 40 years of etd behind me, they just don’t work anymore and I don’t have to equalize.) I dreaded flying.

I also did scuba and with my ear history it was a really dumb move. Busted my eardrum once descending without being able to equalize. You might have already had ETD or been predisposed towards it and repeated equalizing messed up your tubes a bit.

Don’t sleep on possible ETD, it can really mess your ears up. Just my thoughts 🤷‍♀️

First off, that totally sucks and I'm so sorry. Not exactly the same thing happened to me. My first 2 ents and first audiologist were like yeah your deaf, bye. My mom got me referred to someone else, and she worked extra hard, and it's amazing of where i am now. After lots of testing with many doctors, I found i had lupus, and it's what caused all my issues. I'm not saying you have it per se, but everything you're saying was what I was going through at the beginning of my hearing loss. Some questions that might be able to think about:
Did you hear a loud pop or two in the beginning of all this? Like when you hold your nose and breath and your ears pop only, but it's the loudest you've ever heard it! Does it sound like people are talking in your head, and no one is there? When you are underwater, do you feel like you're leaning to one side more? When you lay down on your bed, do you feel like you're falling, but you're already lying down? Yes, to any of these, tell a neurologist and get a new Ent, please. I kick myself in the butt for not getting even a 3rd opinion bc hearing is so important not just to hear but balance of walking too! I love swimming and i miss going by myself. Im now stuck wearing a hearing aid and had to get an implant, too. I have to have someone with me when I go swimming it suuucckks. We water people want to be in the water. If the water pressure is hurting you, that's also a big red flag, so like i said, see a neurologist. For the meantime, what I did is take was something for the swelling. Yeah, it's your ear drums swelling...its nuts. My dr gave me some presidone...ik that sounds weird, but presidone damn that sh*t cut the noise almost completely or at least to where I could at take it. So please ask your doctor. Ik the feeling where every noise or in my case it was and sometimes still is a baby crying+jazz band playing+ train chugging along+ voices in my head have full on convos all at once all day and all night. So i get it, and I really hope you get some relief and rest soon. That damn tinnitus causes so much crap where you feel like you're gonna pull your hair out. Sorry for the rambling but I hope this gives you more direction or something to think about! Good luck and wishing you luck!",2025-07-15 01:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1m05e8c/idk_what_to_do_im_going_crazy/

This is so sweet 🥹 Kudos to you for reaching out for help ❤️

I’m a person who has been hard of hearing from birth, it’s hereditary in my family. 

The KEY piece of advice to you is to be patient. Patience is a golden skill to someone with hearing difficulties. 

I found a post on Facebook just the other day that outlines many things that are helpful to someone with hearing difficulties. I can’t seem to attach photos in this sub so I’ll DM them to you. 

You could also suggest learning sign language together if that’s something that interests him. Despite being HoH my whole life, I’m only now learning sign language in my mid-30s. Mostly in case my hearing gets worse or to supplement conversations.

Give an extra second of breath between phrases. It helps the auditory processing have a moment to catch upb(the game of madgab we have to play in our heads to make what we DO hear make more sense). Just between every sentence or two take a big breath. I have a red yellow green light system with my husband. The day changes on how stressed my brain is when I can be quick with madgab and when it fails. So having a degree of hearing established when you get in the door from work will help set expectations for the day and ease frustrations. And I would insist on at least a handful of signs for when everything is going wrong with hearing. ""Help"", ""leave alone"", ""love you"", ""thanks"", ""sorry"", ""annoy"", and the suffixes for ""future now past"". Because when I'm over stimulated or my husband's ADHD is frustrated with me:  ""stop it annoying"" . ""I want to be alone"" . ""help hungry"" . ""again"" . ""I'm done"". All are very helpful in knowing if we need to try another route to get answers or leave and come back to it.

The reason he didn't learn sign language is because his speech therapy and hearing education focused on being able to learn how to function in real life with anyone. My case was similar, I was born with bilateral hearing loss and I was never taught sign language. I can listen with my headphones and talk to people, although sometimes just listening is a little difficult. In your boyfriend's case, it would be best to adjust the power of his cochlear implants. I don't think I want to learn sign language right now, but that's just a very personal opinion. And for your part, speak clearly and slowly, with a lot of patience. It's a team effort and I admire your desire to help your boyfriend, it's a very noble task!

Have you talked about it with him? There are lots of best practices. Get his attention, face each other, make sure he can see your mouth to read lips to help his mind confirm which sounds you're making, etc. He might have more tips. Be patient. Some people are more willing to put in the extra effort than others.

Ask him what he find easier and prefers as it can differ from person to person. For example some people would rather you motion to get their attention than tap them.

Nobody learned in my family and while I would like to, others don't. So that's up to him. For us, it's a lot of patience. For example, to speak to me you have to wait for my attention to be on your face since I'm a lil reader. I won't do well if you talk from my side or behind me or across the room. Worse in groups.

Your post is partially about hearing and speech, specifically what viable options are available and also about relationship of how to tackle a problem to ensure that you two can be happy together.  I think, from the relationship question perspective, you sitting down with him and share what you wrote here is the first step.  Then, work together to find a viable solution that works best for you.  And if he wants to pick up sign language as a solution, that is fine.  
I don’t think your bf wants to be told of what solution he needs, but I am sure he is willing to find a good solution, either on his own or together with you, once he acknowledges your genuine concern.  He likely has been told so many times of what he needed, throughout his life, and the last thing he needs to be told one more thing of what he needs.  Just a thought.

The most important thing is to make sure you are asking him what works best for him, and that you follow what he suggests.

General things to be mindful of include facing him when you are talking to him, not covering your mouth, and getting his attention before beginning to speak.

Also, if he asks you to repeat, focus on clarity, not just volume.

Discuss this with him first, to make sure it applies, but I personally need someone to repeat things the same way the first time, because I’m usually trying to fill in a blank in what they said, and the cadence helps me know what’s missing.

I will usually repeat back what I heard and say “what” or “who” in place of the part I missed.

Like “You went to the park and did what with who?”

If you try a couple of times and he doesn’t get some part, try saying it in a different way entirely - but don’t go straight to that, most things can be deciphered as originally spoken for most folks, and it’s abundantly frustrating for me not to be given the chance to solve the puzzle lol.

May we all get considerate partners like you! Thank you.

I’m 39 years old I was born in 1986, my parents didn’t realize I was deaf until I was 3 years old and never thought of putting me in A.S.L ( American Sign Language) so I had to learn oral
Communication which was and is still hard for me to speak and say the words properly until I got to around 25 years old and this is 4 years with my wife at the time gf  I started learning sign language and teaching my girlfriend what I learn in A.S.L class as I go and at first I didn’t realize how hard it was on her to communicate with me until she told me. If he really love you and want to build the relationship more I suggest you talk to him about either him 
Or you to go to class and learn and teach each other over the course and that my best advice to you and I hope it helps! :)

At your age, no one is stopping you from learning to sign. Start yesterday. Just do it. It won’t solve anything right away, but you’ll learn invaluable things about communication.

You definitely should persuade him to learn sign language. I know sign language, but I don't use iir as much becauae I read lips.   I have been hearing impaired for most of my life..

Couples therapy is the way to go!!! Check out [Deaf Counseling Center](https://www.deafcounseling.com)

Just a gentle correction: it's hard of hearing, not ""hearing impaired."" That's considered something of a slur in the Deaf world because it focuses on what they don't have rather than what they do.

You should see an audiologist and ent

You said you are in school?  If it is still highschool or earlier go to see the guidance counselor or school nurse.  The district may have resources or be able to put you in touch with government resources that will provide these services at no cost to you or your family.  This has been 40 or so years ago, but when I was in grade school my school district sent me to an audiologist and eventually the state paid for hearing aids even though my family had good insurance.  The school district was where it all started though.  If you are in college go through student health services if it is available.  I would also start asking your friends if they can put on the closed captions instead of turning up the volume.  It is really telling when you find out who will do it and who won't or makes a big deal of it.

My ear canals and eardrums are super clean also, but I have a hereditary hearing loss. Mine was detected at a very early age from an audiologist. I knew my hearing would decrease over time. I am now severe to profoundly hard of hearing. See an audiologist and it can determine the level of your hearing loss. Did this just happen recently, or has your hearing been decreasing over time?

It can be so many things. For example I have a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. Not saying this is you, but definitely go to an audiologist and take it from there.

Did the health care do a hearing test? You definitely should get one.

I know this doesn't answer your question, but instead of asking them to turn up the TV, ask them to put on subtitles! 

Also as others said, you need to see an audiologist.

go to a specialist. i noticed pretty significant hearing loss in high school, my family doctor noticed a hole in my ear drum and sent me to a specialist who discovered a cholesteatoma (skin growth) that ate away my middle ear bones, causing the hearing loss. they should be able to give you answers and any necessary next steps!

Not being able to follow conversations in groups. The choices are:

(1) Let it go, and you won’t understand what the conversation was about; or, when everyone bursts out laughing, you’ll have no idea why. (You’ll hear the punchline and find it unfunny, because you missed key parts of the setup.)

(2) Keep interrupting the speaker to ask them to repeat what you didn’t hear, and end up annoying everyone.

- Bike bells
- Smoke alarms
- Missing/overhearing gossip and embarrassing yourself
- Platform change announced, missing your train

I recently took a long haul flight. First thing I did was go to a cabin crew member and explain that I am hard of hearing and that I have trouble understanding public announcements so in the event of ermergency, someone would need to come to me.

I have also done the same in different situations. Like my bus will terminate unexpectedly somewhere I am unfamiliar with and I did not understand the announcements made about this. Some things are about self-awareness just like people with ""normal"" hearing. So if someone with normal hearing is wearing noise cancelling headphones and going down a busy street, the things they can do to maximise their safety: walking on the side facing traffic, if at zebra crossing then wait until the green man shows or remove headphones as well as look.

I used to cross the street without waiting for the green man. But I once was waiting at a very busy intersection and someone on a bike just flew by and crashed into the person next to me. Well, into their small suitcase (the noise it made was sickening) but this made me aware of the gap between seeing/hearing. So I may not always be able to see oncoming vehicles so now even though I see people crossing or there seemingly are no vehicles coming through, I still wait until the green man shows. I feel silly but I know why I am doing it.

I can usually hear the pitch of fire alarms but I am also aware that there may be fire alarms in some places that I may not be able to hear. Depending on the circumstances, I may have a discussion with someone about this (like work).

But part of being hard of hearing is becoming more aware of people's body language. When I am out and about, it is more about being constantly alert as to how people around me are behaving which gives indications as to what is going on.",2025-07-13 03:19:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lyiq3o/what_are_the_biggest_issues_you_deal_with_as_a/

I want to make sure they are literate and able to advocate for themselves as well. They deserve and equitable playing field and I think I can help with that. So, I ask, how can I get started in a way that really does good and is wasting no one's time?

Thank you.

P.S. I will go for my bachelors, but I learn much better with field work than just classwork...

Edit- I really am not trying to be a hero, I know from personal experience how demeaning and unhelpful that is... I just want to do some good for a community that i respect a lot. Thank you.

MAJOR EDIT0

I am not thinking ASL is a basic language, all Sign Languages are beautiful, complex and well developed. What I was trying to explain is that i cannot simcom, that is too precise for me. The wires cross and that is a huge part of interpreteting. I am far too aware that it is not enough to have basics, I even said I was going to continue to learn more ASl and Deaf Culture in college, I live in Rochester, the resources are there.

I have only one semester of ASL skill, I want to have far more before i enter the work force. This is why I am asking for help, so I know precisely how to make the most out of my time so I CAN be the best fit for this community. I have time, that is the point.

To be concise, my goal is to take my four Human services courses per semester and then an Asl elective to round it out. This includes deaf studies... I am not taking this lightly.

I hope to be the best fit to help those I respect and can see myself being a good help... this is not a light goal. I am going all in. Heck I want to take ASL course in my bachelors as well...

The reason I am getting my Associates first is to get into a Deaf led organization and get my feet wet, to keep my skills up and more. Signing as part of my job, working in that community would be paramount ot mastering the language and understanding the culture.

One thing I can share with you is that people who have lost their hearing later in life (versus congenital) sometimes, if not always… go through the five stages of grief. Which includes anger, denial, bargaining and eventually hopefully acceptance. And it can be soooo isolating, leading into social isolation.

I (31F, Australia) have very good hearing for high frequencies e.g. can hear the noise of bird deterrence machine that most adults can not hear however when there is background noise like at a busy restaurant and someone is talking to me I struggle to hear.

I did one of those free hearing tests that shops that sell hearing aids do a few years ago and my hearing was fine. It isn't ear wax as having my ears cleaned doesn't make a difference. I am Autistic and have adhd so wonder if it's a sensory processing issue rather than a hearing issue. I'm not sure if I should spend the money getting a proper hearing test or not as if it's just a sensory processing issue there isn't much you can do about it.

I am in college. I feel like I don't have a social life anymore. I can't talk to people before or after class or at clubs anymore because of the noise. Except for two friends I manage to meet once a month at my place, I'm basically completely socially isolated. I try to visit my family more often to balance it, but it's obviously not the same. 

I started testing hearing aids today. In my home country they're super expensive and health insurance covers basically nothing. The ones I'm testing right now are already stretching my budget a fair bit. 
I went to a club meeting to today to try them out. I came home crying. I understood what was being said in the group discussion but as soon as everyone is talking amongst them self I'm out. 

I don't know what to do. It's like I'm being forced the choose between financial stability and having a social life. I've already been struggling with my mental health before any of this started, but the current situation is obvious only making things worse. I'm also waiting for a formal ADHD diagnosis and supposed to go on an exchange semester in Asia in September.

1lwbls9,hardofhearing,Seeking feedback from people with hearing loss about hearing in noise (5-min uni survey),"Hi everyone,

I'm part of a research team at Edinburgh Napier University.

We're trying to solve a problem I'm sure many of you know all too well: the 'cocktail party problem'. That feeling of being in a busy restaurant or at a family gathering and just being totally overwhelmed by noise, making it impossible to follow a single conversation. It's mentally exhausting.

Our team is developing a new type of hearing aid tech that uses a different approach to filter out that background noise and focus on the person you're talking to.

To make sure we're building something that actually helps, we need to hear from people with real-world experience. That's where you come in. We've put together a short, anonymous survey that takes about 2-3 minutes to complete.

I just need people around me to take me seriously, and that’s *not* something anyone can help me with except the specific people I am interacting with in person, in each instance. For example, if I ask someone to repeat what they just said because I didn’t catch it all, then that person needs to treat me with basic dignity and respect by repeating what they just said. I *don’t* need them to dismiss me, grouch at me for inconveniencing them, tell me to listen harder, simplify the content as if they’re explaining something to a child, flail their arms and fingers in mock sign language, treat me as a lesser-than, or say, “Never mind.” I just need them to repeat what they said. 

If I ask them to speak in a stage voice, then they need to speak in a stage voice. If I tell them to stand in front of me and face me while speaking, then they need to do so. If I tell them it’s too noisy here, then we need to reduce the noise if possible or move to a quieter place. If I tell them I was able to hear them better fifteen minutes ago but can’t hear them as well right now because my tinnitus is flaring, I need them to believe me. If I tell them I have trouble hearing and can’t hear some sounds at all but am also sensitive to certain types of noise, yes, all at the same time, I need them to trust that I’m telling the truth, even if they don’t understand because it’s not something they’ve ever experienced. I need them to accept that I know what my needs are, believe me, and do the simple things I request of them to facilitate communication. 

I understand that communicating with someone who is Hard of Hearing requires patience and sometimes patience is in short supply. It’s OK for them to be frustrated. I get it. It’s frustrating for me, too. If they tell me this sucks, I’ll agree with them. Let’s acknowledge that emotional truth and then get on with the business of communicating. With small adjustments, we can make it work.

Well, you do need the knowledge you note, but I think it’s a lot about social skills. Hearing people think so differently and misunderstand so many things about deafness and hearing loss, that you need to be creative to find explanations or requests that they actually will understand and will accept to adapt to. Sometimes you might need facts and graph, sometimes refer to legislation and sometimes you need a personal story or anecdote to help people understand. It’s so much about communication. The hearing person can’t know what solutions exist, and especially not what will work for us in the specific situation or not.

Communication, patience and persistence. We need to drop the ego. People are more prepared to support if we are friendly and positive rather than tired. They don’t know if we had a terrible day and are exhausted from adapting to hearing needs. Being nice and friendly when advocating, does not mean we should just give in or not stand up for ourselves. Of course not. Being clear about what works and what doesn’t helps. Make sure the hearing person understands the advantages to them, by arranging accommodations, if you see any.",2025-07-08 10:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lulb8p/what_is_the_thing_you_feel_like_you_need_most_to/

I'm not fully sure of your question but I wouldn't use chat gpt. It doesn't actually know information. It's not like a research librarian or something. It literally just knows what words tend to show up next to each other on the internet and spits them out at you based on that. It also is incredibly bad for the environment, like scary cartoonishly so.

ChatGPT actually has too little information on our issues. I learn from more experienced Deaf/HoH. It’s so important to get a network and role models. (We need to look for that ourselves, unfortunately.) Associations for HoH and Deaf Clubs are one place to look. I would be vary of hearing professionals, but sometimes they might know some things.

Also, trust your gut feeling about what will work or not. Don’t be afraid of experimenting.

My suggestion is becoming your own coach. 

I have been hyper self-aware especially navigating situations. ChatGPT is just a tool, but one that I use frequently. 

What I suggest from experience, is have a journal. I did this for a good month, writing down all social situations happening and how I felt about them. This revealed my pre-, intra- and post-thoughts when socializing (i.e. at work). 

I assume, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's mostly about talking to people? 

If so, you are doing it right. Ask questions, be curious, look for solutions.

1ltx2sj,hardofhearing,Baby cry transmitter - Australia,"I'll start this post with an apology, none of the people involve in my question are deaf nor have any reduction in their hearing abilities. Hear me out. Oh and I have searched this sub and read the wikipage. 

I'm a parent to twin toddlers. Some of the medication I take at night sedates me, so I am basically knocked out. My wife is who primarily tends to our babies. We've had an impossible time with their sleep, so it's not uncommon for my wife to get 2-3 hrs of sleep at night.

The babies currently are each in their own room. Both their rooms share a wall with ours - we're not fat at all. We have 2 different monitor systems, which should be enough. But the stars have aligned a few times, both have failed, and we've woken to the horrific realisation that our babies have been crying, and we did not hear them. No shade to people who sleep train; it's simply not in line with our values. 

Last year, when they were newborns and I was working and up doing feeds too, we found in our exhaustion, we kept turning off alarms on our phones, but had no recollection of this. I can't remember how I came across is, but I ended up buying an old Bellman &amp; Symfon clock and bed shaker and it was a blessing. No more missed alarms. Now that the babies are in their own room (I say babies, they're both &gt;12mo old), we need something that alerts us **reliably** that they need us. 

I'm aware B&amp;S have a baby cry transmitter + receiver system. The 2 x baby cry transmitters + the flash receiver would cost us AUD $962 which is crazy expensive. The wiki page listed other makers like Clarity, bebcare, Sonic Alert, and Serene innovations. Most of these are not available here. 

I'm hoping fellow Aussies can comment on what they use? maybe the B&amp;S is worth the steep price, or maybe there are alternatives we've not considered.

Having a conversation in a loud inviroment is very difficult.  That's my major setback.

What problem do you think we have with situational awareness that isn’t super easy to solve? The only problem I have is getting hearing people to understand what it is like to to be HoH/Deaf - and then actually do something that facilitates communication instead of the usual opposite. It’s the social aspects of hearing people only accepting speech as communication that is a problem, now situational awareness. With hearing aids, there are no problems hearing sounds, the problem is interpreting what you hear. Music becomes more a blended mess of noise, instead of being interesting as it should be, and voices are incomprehensible as soon as there is background noise, distance to the speaker or you don’t see the speaker clearly. Your idea doesn’t help with that at all.

I have a hard time localizing/targeting sounds. Sometimes I can’t tell which door is opening, or who and where someone is walking around and/or talking. Especially as a sewing enthusiast I often have to stop sewing or cutting fabric to confirm there is in fact a noise/voice and then engage with it (especially since I do not enjoy the oddly specific sounds that come with sewing while wearing hearing aids).

I'm SSD and it's frustrating locating sounds.  I do not wear a cross aid because it actually makes the location slower and more compromised.  It's hard to explain.  But imo useless for playing sports.

Bikes approaching from behind me when I’m walking on a trail. 

Someone trying to get my attention to talk to me by using their voice since they refuse to flash the lights or text me or use their voice since “walkie-talkie” on the iPhone / Apple Watch. 

I agree with the cars above when walking on the road or sidewalks. 


— — — — — — — — — — — 

Something that could vibrate, maybe using different haptics sequences depending on the sound type or direction or speed or distance?

like many others have mentioned my biggest struggle is understanding people in crowded spaces especially if there's a group, people are looking away, mumbling, facial hair etc... Im a runner and I'm currently training for a half marathon, so recently my biggest struggle is hearing cars and knowing which direction they are coming from when crossing a street (I end up swivel-heading a lot and getting honked at haha) I feel relatively safe and my family/friends have been really great about accommodating me especially in group settings. I'm really intrigued by this and appreciate your kindness!! 

(quick note/opinion to the general hoh and deaf community, if someone you're hanging around/giving your time to won't do the decency of making sure you understand them/feel included, you deserve better, that's bare minimum!!)

Personally, I dream of a device that tells me if a car is approaching. 

I don’t drive. I walk almost everywhere, including to and from work every day. This is particularly dangerous because my most severe hearing loss is in the low frequencies so it’s hard for me to hear cars, even when I’m wearing my hearing aids. Some cars sound too similar to my roaring tinnitus to discern whether it’s an approaching danger or the noise I’ve been trying to ignore all day and night for the last twelve years. This isn’t always a problem when I’m crossing a road that allows me to see traffic in both directions because I can rely on my vision to see what’s coming and know when I can cross safely. Unfortunately, I am sometimes required to cross blind intersections, such as T-intersections where the through road is tightly curved. Even worse, such an intersection with signs that instruct drivers to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk but they can’t see me either until they come around the curve and are too close to stop, let alone slow down. I am required to risk crossing one of those almost daily. It feels way too much like Russian Roulette. Little wonder I fight anxiety to just leave the house sometimes. 

Ideally, I want a device that hears cars and can calculate their position and speed in relation to me, in real time. Maybe it lights up green when it’s safe, but turns yellow when a car is approaching from a distance and runs through the gradients to orange and red when the car is too close and fast to stop? Maybe it uses different haptics to let me know when it’s safe, when it’s risky, and when it’s dangerous? Maybe it integrates with Google maps to model cars in real time? All of the above? Something else? If it uses haptics, maybe it’s part of a high visibility vest that vibrates or pulses or thumps? I am just brainstorming and have no idea what’s even viable, but it could be an interesting project for you.

These approaches seem to be submissive(?), or something. 

The hardest tip I haven’t been able to explain is the need to get my attention first. Something people with normal hearing don’t need to do?

Like call my name, flick the lights on/off, text me, use the walker-talkie feature on the Apple Watch…

It’s frustrating that I HAVE to be constantly alert for any potential conversations. 

I have more issues with conversations but I’d like some feedback on how to better advocate for the RULES or TIPS that will best help me within conversations. 

I feel like a broken record telling people to uncover their faces so I can read their lips. Plus, I feel like I’m unimportant when I can’t be involved in conversations where the conditions are not ideal.

I actually disagree with the first ""if they misheard you"" suggestion. If I ask someone to repeat themselves I want them to repeat it exactly the same way at least once, to give me a chance to catch the words. Rephrasing things is annoying because they don't just change the words, they start to explain things like I didn't understand the *meaning* of what they said instead of not being able to hear what words they're using.

""Would you like me to leave room in the cup?""

""I'm sorry, could you say that again?""

""Oh...(spends five seconds deciding how to explain)...Leaving room in the cup means I don't fill it all the way so you have the option of putting in cream and sugar.""

I just answer the question at that point, but I *know* what 'leave room in the cup' means, I just couldn't tell that's what you said, *and* I had to try to decipher a whole new sentence. It's a waste of time and brainpower. God help us if I can't hear the explanation either, we could be here all day lol.

Edit: Hit send too early. My wife is one person who does the explanation thing and it drives me nuts. I've started saying ""please repeat the exact words you just said"" to remind her. It sounds kind of robotic but people don't get what I mean if I'm not blunt about it.

I sat my family down and basically ran though my needs with them, like how loudly I need them to speak, that I need them to face me and not be too far away, that it's better for me if they repeat the same words even if it feels weird, and to not say ""never mind"" because that's actively excluding me.   
  
For strangers, I usually will just say ""I'm hard of hearing, could you please speak up?"" or ""I'm hard of hearing, I need to you to be kind of loud"" if it's going to be a longer conversation, like at a medical appointment. You could say something similar, but with your top need or needs. Then if needed, I'll add things like ""I need you to face me"" or whatever's necessary.",2025-07-06 10:36:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lsy6bk/advocating_for_communicating_with_others/

1ls5xb9,hardofhearing,I love being HOH but it’s so hard.,"I’ve been HOH all my life. But I’ve always been in a hearing world. My mom just ignored it but I think it’s because she never really understood. Still doesn’t. I’m 31 now and I just got her to accept cc like a year ago. I mainly read lips but I’m trying to learn SEE or ASL. I thought SEE would be best for my family but no one is interested in learning for me. I have hearing aids so that should be enough. I have to constantly fit into their world instead of them trying to understand mine. Sometimes I think it’s pointless to do all this learning because I’m only one who “knows”. I have no one to practice / sign with. There is an elderly old lady in my extremely small town who is deaf and I love running into her. We sign to each other and I felt so happy and proud in a way I’ve never felt before or can even describe. Maybe it’s because it was the first time I felt valid. Is it like this for most of us? I just feel like I don’t fit in anywhere really.

Does your city have a Deaf community? Sounds like you might find peers who understand you and appreciate your experiences there. They can help you learn to sign, too.

As for your family, can you do more to advocate for yourself without escalating tension? They really don’t understand your experience but maybe there are steps you can take to help them meet your needs. For example, I had a scary stern boss who didn’t understand how little I could hear in some situations. He interpreted assertiveness as questioning his authority but I found other ways. I would say, “I didn’t catch all of what you said because there’s so much noise in here but I think you said [repeat back what I honestly heard]. Is that correct?” I was very matter of fact. When he caught on that I was honestly trying to hear him and struggling, he would call me into a quiet spot or turn off his radio or so on, then speak in a stage voice when he needed to tell me something. Excellent! He wasn’t a bad guy. Rather, we just needed to learn to meet each other’s needs. Do you think something like that would work for you?

You should look into Cued Speech.  It's easy to learn and since it uses your native language you don't have to learn a new language to communicate.

Same boat but I would never say I love being HOH. I am working now to form connections in the Deaf world and learning ASL. I just can't seem to function socially in the hearing world and that's never going to get better. However, I can eventually learn to socialize in the Deaf way because it just depends on my willpower. I can't will my ears to work.

Omg same here! I have always had hearing aids for my moderate bilateral hearing loss but my mom thinks the hearing aids cure my hearing loss and I don’t need sign even though that would be so helpful. I also don’t have anyone to practice with :(

This is my EXACT experience also! I still don’t sign, but plan to learn with a friend who took classes and is willing to teach me. I have two other siblings (there’s a total of 5 of us), that are also HoH. They do not have a desire to learn ASL, but basic signs would be helpful for them. Maybe I can get them to learn with me. Keep signing with the elder lady you run into in the small town. Maybe you two can become friends and meet up occasionally. 😍

That's one of the things I've had to learn to accept. Nobody has been willing to learn sign language to communicate with me.

Theres an American Sign Language discord with amazing people from the Deaf community who almost always are willing to join and chat. There are beginner chats and advanced chats. I'm not sure about them signing SEE, but they always answer questions and are willing to help. 
Everyones pretty chatty in there too, so you're bound to make some friends too!. Plenty of HOH'ing people as well. Best of luck, I know how hard it is to get people to understand.

I’m a 33 year old female, who’s parent ignored hers too- didn’t even tell me, I’m also learning asl and am hard of hearing! Would love to chat sometime! Maybe we can practice off of one ankthern",2025-07-05 09:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ls5xb9/i_love_being_hoh_but_its_so_hard/

Unless it's transcribed beforehand, it needs to be processed. Like, it's transmitted through the internet to hit computer servers where an algorithm calculates the word that sound is most likely to be. Then it comes back to the TV where individual TV settings are applied. Or it's processed by the TV itself which is far from a supercomputer. All of this happens super fast but it adds up. Honestly the fact that we can get generated captioning as fast as we do is incredible. Words need to be complete to caption and phrases might change which word it is most likely to be.

VLC can control the caption offset.

It’s so frustrating when captions on recorded stuff are wrong or out of sync. I’ve heard that, for streaming video, it can be an internet connection issue, which I guess makes sense. I live in a rural area and our internet isn’t always fabulous. 

The technology has progressed a lot, but it’s just not there for super accurate live captioning.

If audio had these issues, there'd be an uproar. Notice how difficult it is to watch reels &amp; other short videos with captions that are endlessly covered by advertising.

If you're live captioning with a tool like zipcaptions.app or Web Captioner then they're pretty instantaneous. The majority of captions on streaming platforms are terrible however!

There really is no excuse for poor speed on AI captions. They're just not using sophisticated enough technology. If you compare to the speed of https://xrai.glass app you'll see what's possible!",2025-07-04 16:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lrmg2i/caption_delay/

1lpciba,hardofhearing,Waterproof Swim Caps or Alternatives,"Hi, new to this subreddit. 
I have a perforation in my ear drum and probably need a tympanoplasty surgery. Long overdue for an ENT appointment so set one for September. 

I already avoid getting water in my ears but was just at hot yoga recently and my sweat trickled down into my affected ear and it was painful and uncomfortable. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m missing out on a lot of water-based activities already — I can’t even do hot yoga!?

Anyways, I feel like there’s a bucket list of experiences I can’t engage in because I cannot submerge my head in water without being painful and affecting my hearing. I’ve never jumped off a rope swing into a lake, gone kayaking, tried surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, etc etc. I feel like I’m missing out on a lot of special, exhilarating thrills that I’ve always wanted to try.

I used to have custom molded earplugs and would cut a swim cap at the top to pull it over my ears when I took swimming lessons as a kid. Does anyone have a solution like this to keep your ears absolutely waterproof? I’m worried that a swim cap would not hold up in some of these high-impact scenarios. Open to hearing all ideas!

1lp0mbd,hardofhearing,How do you cope with intentional mean comments about your hearing ?,"Hello everyone ! 

As a context : I have a mild to moderate hearing loss on my right ear and have been wearing a hearing aid on it for 10 months. For my two ears, I have chronicle otitis so I tend to have blocked ears and I have to unclog them to hear better. In general my hearing aid helps me understand men in noisy environments (bar, restaurants), their voice appears clearer. I realised I needed them last year because I felt like I needed to strain to hear even though it’s a light loss. 

I am also a musician, I decided to retake classes in my local conservatory and go to an orchestra the same time I got my hearing aid because I felt like I needed to prove myself I was unstoppable lol 

Anyway I have long hair so most of the time people don’t notice my HA (some do but don’t say anything, I notice because they stare at me ear haha) but I would mention them if they speak too softly so they don’t complain if I make repeat them, or sometimes because I took a call and they realised I took it with my HA. 

I was at a bar to celebrate my resignation, and a guy was touching my instrument, asking about my experience and level. And a girl asked me in a very amused voice : « But aren’t you deaf ?? Oh so when you don’t understand what we say it’s not because you’re autistic it’s because you’re deaf hahaha » And I was so shocked that I nervously laughed. I found it so humiliating that when someone acknowledged my skills she would talk down to me about my loss (and the fact that I might be neurodivergent) 

The thing is that in other contexts I’m used to give very spicy answers/punchlines that make people shout their mouth, but I don’t know how to navigate with this new aspect of my life ? What do you do ?

1lmty5l,hardofhearing,Advice for transcription app in the making,"**TL;DR:**  
I built a simple web transcription app for my dad, who’s deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other. Existing apps either don't work well in Spanish or require high-end phones. This tool uses newer speech-to-text tech and works in a browser on any device. It’s been helpful for him in 1:1 conversations and even live-translating English TV. I’m looking for a few early users (especially Spanish speakers) to try it out and share feedback.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on something I hope might help others here. My dad is deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other, and even with hearing aids, he still struggles with comprehension.

As a supplement to his hearing aid, we've tried a bunch of transcription applications—[Ava](https://ava.me/), [Otter.ai](http://otter.ai/), [Google Live Transcribe](https://www.android.com/accessibility/live-transcribe/), and others. While they’re decent in English, my dad's primary language is Spanish. I noticed the Spanish transcription quality just wasn’t where it should be for any of these applications, making them fairly ineffective for us.

What I realized is that many of these tools likely aren’t using the latest, state-of-the-art speech-to-text models. On top of that, some of the most accurate transcription apps, like Google’s Recorder, are only available on the latest phones that support on-device models. I wanted to create something that could work across all devices, not just high-end ones. So I built a simple web app that *does* use newer technology, just to see if it could make a meaningful difference.

It’s not fancy, but so far it’s performed better than alternatives and has been helpful for my dad in quieter, 1:1 settings, as a backup when he’s not wearing his hearing aids, at doctor appointments (nothing is recorded/saved so should be if patients ask to use it during visits), or to even live translate from the english tv shows with no Spanish captions since his chrome automatically translates English to Spanish on web pages.

I’m sharing it in case it might be useful to others too. My goal is just to offer another tool to help those with hearing issues.

I’m hoping to find a few early users who’d be open to trying it out and giving occasional feedback. If there’s good validation, the next step would be to turn this into a full mobile app with more features tailored to what people actually need.

Tips:  
\- It works best on mobile since it's able to use your mobile device's microphone.  
\- You can install it as a PWA on [ios](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation#ios_and_ipados_installation) and [android](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation#android_installation) for a slightly better user experience, if at some point it doesnt seem to load, just delete it and try installing it again.

Data integrity and security is a problem, both with the big companies and someone independent. It’s difficult for a user to know and trust what happens to the captured sound.

The feature I’m mostly lacking in the existing apps, is the ability to adjust text size. I want the phone to be placed well to capture the speakers, and that means the text needs to be bigger so I can see it properly. Most HoH are older and shouldn’t need to. Ring their reading glasses to use the captioning.

1llwv3g,hardofhearing,Career for hoh that isn’t so frustrating,"I understand that a person who is hard of hearing can pretty much do anything… but, for me, I’m finding I’m zonked every day due to how much bandwidth it takes to get through a work day. In my case I think there is also some anxiety and auditory processing as well as insomnia = bad combination. 

I’m in my 40s but considering IT or something that is more cerebral or at a computer. I have thought about the trades but I’m too old. And something like carpentry, for example, would be really loud. I personally have found blue collar types to be less disability friendly, generally speaking. 

Anyway, I would probably be in sales if not for my hearing loss but I’m sincerely concerned about, say, giving a presentation and then not being able to do a q and a bc of the poor acoustics. In my current job it’s like people are speaking another language sometimes if they’re using speakerphone or have an accent, etc. 

Thanks for any help on this!

I’m hard of hearing, nothing better than analyst or any desk job that hearing isn’t required most of the time. Can’t recommend phones or call centers because they’d just destroy any hearing you have left with amplifiers.

I work in tech, my job is mostly remote. All the video conference call apps have captions. I have a reasonable accommodation to also have a transcription app, because the dedicated apps work better.

For in person meetings I either use the transcription app or I log in to Zoom and use the captions there. For most normal sized meetings the mic on my laptop is sufficient. For big events my company provides a mic for the speaker. 

Besides meetings, all our communication happens on Slack.

What do you currently do? 

I'm in the architecture field, a surprising amount of being able to hear is required, quite frustrating. But you may want to look at the type of employer rather than field. Depending on where you live. Large companies are more likely to accommodate without a kerfuffle, same with government. There are work around solutions for most stuff, the biggest thing is the stigma and people's attitudes.

I do accounting for a bank.  There's some phone time involved but Microsoft Teams has decent subtitles.

I found a phone, I’m about to apply for some admin jobs that have subtitles on a screen! Maybe helpful?

I'm 25 years old and I also have profound high frequency hearing loss, I work from home in IT and use the auto captions feature in Microsoft teams, there is also another caption tool integrated in windows, and that's how I get through the day, If I don't use it I don't understand what people are saying at all, I just hear mumbling

IT would be great. There are lots of work from home jobs in that field and other fields as well. In the past I did data entry and writing from home. Currently I'm a door dasher and it's not too bad, since conversations are minimal, and most of my time is spent driving.",2025-06-27 15:31:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1llwv3g/career_for_hoh_that_isnt_so_frustrating/
1lljo9e,hardofhearing,Isolation and hearing loss and loneliness,"I’m 30 years old. Doing my CA final now.
Single. Isolated. Still trying.

I’ve had mild to moderate hearing loss for a while now — not enough to be called deaf, but enough to miss conversations, group talks, casual jokes, and invitations. So I stopped showing up. I slowly disappeared from people’s lives.
And now, no one really calls me unless it’s work or a delivery guy.

After 12th, I couldn’t afford to study full-time. My father went bankrupt, and I had to start working immediately, pay family debts, and support my home. I somehow studied graduation alongside work, paid the bills, stayed in Bangalore, and just kept surviving.

In 2020 during COVID, I brought my family from our village to Bangalore — they couldn’t stay there anymore. I took care of everything with the money I earned from teaching.

I started CA in 2013, but due to life and responsibilities, I had to pause.
Only after we sold our land and cleared family debts could I fully restart again. I cleared CA Inter without coaching (because I couldn’t afford it) and now I’m in CA Final. My articleship runs till Sept 2026 and I’ll write my final exams in May 2027.

From 2013 to 2025 — it’s been just non-stop struggle.
No social life. No college memories. No weddings, parties, or birthdays.
I’ve lost touch with everyone from school and college.
I didn’t have the bandwidth for friendships — I was always in survival mode.

Now I’m 30, single, and sometimes I feel like I do want a companion, but I’m scared.
Scared I’ll make a decision out of desperation for connection, and regret it later.
And honestly… I don’t even know where I’d meet someone at this point.

Still, something inside me refuses to quit.
Yes, I’m tired. Yes, I’m insecure about how I look, about my hearing, about my age and situation. But I’m also still showing up. I’m working on my health. I’ve started again from scratch. I want to build a life that’s worth living — even if it’s alone.

Some days I think I’ve made peace with loneliness.
Other days I see groups laughing together, and it hits — that I’m missing something deeply human.

I don’t know. I just wanted to write this out.
Is there anyone else out there who feels like life may be a mess, but still holds on to some quiet belief in the future?

Still trying. Still hoping.

Hi, I totally feel and understand what you are saying. You are not alone.

I’m 34. Profound hearing loss, hearing aids. 

Before COVID I had a quite active social life, at the expense of a very stressful routine. But one way or the other, sometimes missing parts of conversations, sometimes lost, but the final balance of showing up was positive. Sometimes I had to make huge efforts.

COVID came in, isolation for years, and I still couldn’t get my social life back. I got used to the comfort of being alone.

But I’m aware this is really bad for health in general. Socialization is a human need. Like sleeping or eating. Not just “deeply human” as you mentioned, is a basic need. 

So I suggest:

- Find yourself the best treatment (aids) and slowly start showing up. You will also learn workarounds to deal with the situations, as lip reading
- Choose events you can better control (parks instead of restaurants)
- If that does not work (or simultaneously), find people in the same situation and connect with them. Through a local association for example, you are not alone
- I’m also learning that I have to accept better my problem and lose the shame. Change the mindset from being a limitation to be “a different way of experiencing the world”
- Find a professional who supports you through the process 

You are in this world, life the life you have right to. Surround yourself by people that understand and are compassionate with your problem. 

We have our own humanity and a lot to give to society.

Best of luck and a lot of strenght. You can make it! Release the best version of yourself!

1ll4t56,hardofhearing,I feel like my mom's right ear is blocked and her hearing is affected.,"My mom’s been hearing impaired for a while, so I got her a hearing aid,  it’s a Philips one. I also bought an endoscope from Amazon that connects to a phone screen so I could check her ears and help clean them out. It’s from a brand called Loyker. Turns out her right ear was pretty blocked. After I cleared it out, she started hearing things she hadn’t heard in years,  birds chirping, wind chimes… even my voice. It hit me hard. I haven’t been able to afford this kind of gear for her until now, and for so long, she missed out on those sounds. Honestly, it made me feel pretty guilty.

ALSO, PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF THIS IS A LONG POST OR IF ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS SEEM STUPID OR EVEN ABELIST, AS I AM ***DESPERATELY*** TRYING TO AVOID WRITING STEREOTYPES/MISINTERPRETATIONS ABOUT CHARACTERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH THINGS I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH.

BEFORE I BEGIN, I KNOW EVERY PERSON AND THEIR EXPERIENCE SIS DIFFERENT, SO I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE MY CHARACTER SOUND LIKE SHE'S EVERY PERSON OR VICE VERSA. I'M TRYING TO BE REALISTIC. IF POSSIBLE, I'D LIKE SOME WRITERS' OPINIONS ON THIS TOO, THANK YOU.

NOW, ANYWHOM: I'M DEBATTING ON WEATHER OR NOT TO-AND I HATE TO SAY IT LIKE THIS BUT I CAN'T FIND OTHER WORDS THAT SOUND...NICER. BUT I'M WONDERING IF I SHOULD GIVE MY HARD OF HEARING (WOMEN, YOUNG ADULT). A FEW MISPRONUNCIATIONS WITH CERTAIN WORDS/A BIT OF THEM?

FOR CONTEXT, SHE HAS HIGH-FREQUENCY SNHL-(SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS), (POSSIBLY) INHERITED FROM HER BIOLOGICAL DAD, (SHE AND HIM BOTH HAVE A SLIGHT SOUTHERN DRAWL), AND SHE'S IS MODERATE IN ONE EAR AND HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN A PROFOUND DIAGNOSIS IN THE OTHER EAR (WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY SEVERE). SHE CHOOSES TO SPEAK AND CAN DO SO QUITE WELL (I HOPE THIS ALL MAKES SENSE), BUT SHE ONLY USES ASL/OTHER MEANS TO COMMUNICATE IF HER HEARING AIDS AREN'T WORKING/ARE OUT. (SHOULD I CHANGE IT TO BE MORE FREQUENT, GIVEN MY QUESTIONS?)

QUESTION 1: GIVEN THIS INFO, HOW OFTEN WILL SHE ASK SOMEBODY TO REPEAT THEMSELVES (I KNOW INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND NOISE, ALONG WITH HOW GOOD ONE'S HEARING AIDS ARE, PLAYS A ROLE), I'M SCARED I'M UNDERDOING IT IN MY BOOK AS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN A WHOLE LOT YET. SO DOES IT NEED TO HAPPEN MORE OFTEN? OR AM I OVERTHINKING IN TERMS OF THINKING I HAVE TO CLARIFY SHE HAS ASKED SOMEBODY TO REPEAT THEMSELVES ALOT?

QUESTION 2: IF I HAVE HER MISPRONOUNCE CERTAIN WORDS, WOULD THAT MAKE SENSE? (I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE ISSUES UNDERSTANDING CONSONANTS TOO) ESPECIALLY GIVEN HER NEWLY PROFOUND EARS? OR DARE I SAY, WOULD IT BE RUDE IF I EVEN CALLED IT, OR HAD SOMEONE ELSE STATE THAT SHE HAS A BIT OF A ""DEAF ACCENT"" TOO?

AND IF SHE DOES MISSPRONOUNCE CERTAIN THINGS, SHOULD I WRITE THEM OUT PHONICALLY, OR WRITE THEM MISPRONOUNCED WITH ANOTHER CHARACTER SAYING THE RIGHT WORD, OR EVEN IF I USE () WITH THE RIGHT SPELLING IN BETWEEN? OR SHOULD I DO A COMBO OF THOSE? LIKE AN EXAMPLE: ""I HATE SIMP!"" (SHRIMP) (OR SHOULD SHE SAY ""RIMP""/""IMP"" SINCE THE AFOREMENTIONED CONSONANT THING)?

OR AGAIN, SHOULD SHE NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES AT ALL? ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S BEEN SPEAKING NORMALLY OTHERWISE AND MAYBE EVEN HAD SPEECH THERAPY WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER?

AGAIN I DON'T MEAN FOR THIS OR ANY OF MY QUESTIONS TO SOUND RUDE OR ANYTHING BUT...BUT...SHOULD I MAYBE SAY INSTEAD OF HER OTHER EAR BEING MODERATE OR SEVER, SHOULD I SWITCH IT TO MILD TO FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM, ""LESSEN"" THINGS...AGAIN I HOPE THAT DON'T COME OFF AS RUDE/DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST ANYONE.

SORRY IF THIS IS CONFUSING I HAVE ISSUES EPLXIANING/ASKIGN THINGS SOMETIMES...I HOPE NONE OF THESE COMES OFF AS RUDE...I DON'T WANNA MISINTERPRET HER OR THE DEAF CULTURE. YET IDK ANYONE WHO'S DEAF/HOH WHO CAN HELP ME, PLUS...I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXTRA MONEY FOR A DEAF/HARD OF HEARING TORITIQUE MY WRITING OR ATM ALL...AND IDK IF IT'S EVEN THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THAT NAYWAYS.

YOUR POST WAS DELETES IN R/DEAF BY THE AUTOMOD FOR RESEARCH. I SUGGEST LOOKING AT THEIR FAQ. THEY HAVE SOME NOTES ABOUT WRITING DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHARACTERS.

I'm not part of the deaf community, but if I were you I'd avoid trying to write anyone's accent. You're likely to come across negatively. Think, for example, of old novels by white authors that would have their black characters ""speak"" in horribly stereotyped language.

Tread carefully, and I apologize if I've misunderstood your post. It was hard for me to read.

Pretty sure she wouldn’t.

Here and now, I am considered deaf , but growing up I was hard of hearing.  So, I don’t have a deaf accent, but I most certainly mispronounced words (still do).  I pronounced words the way I heard words pronounced.  I was hard of hearing, so I heard words pronounced “wrong”.  

As a child, people always tried to correct the way I spoke.  Of course, I didn’t  understand that I was saying the words incorrectly.  All I heard was people saying what I was saying.  I heard no difference, and it was extremely frustrating.  

I still pronounce words incorrectly.  It is what it is.

I don’t think having the character mispronounce words strengthens your writing much or the character in any way. Sure, there may be hoh folks who mispronounce words but I’m hoh and have no accent and do not mispronounce words any more than the next person as far as I know. I mean, my partner laughs at the way I pronounce Warren, for example, so I guess there are the occasional words. But unless it’s something like that to where it’s idiosyncratic I think it’ll just make your writing seem hack. Hope that helps!",2025-06-25 23:11:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lkkkmt/questions_regaurding_speech_and_dailoug_for_a_hoh/
1lk2hqe,hardofhearing,What is the world happened to my right ear?,"So up until atleast 2 years ago I had pretty solid hearing on both ears, I had an aviation medical done in 2023 and my ears were quite similar. I was surprised to see a massive dip in my right ear at 3000 and 4000Hz when I did a test a bit ago. That first test was 25db at 3000Hz and 30db at 4000Hz, I got this one to confirm the dip and scored even worse. I dont notice anything different with my hearing or how my ears feel. I have not taken a blow to the head, had a concussion, been around gunshots or been exposed to hearing loss inducing noise levels. My audiologist was just as befounded. I have an appointment coming up with my family doctor and will most likely see an audiologist.

[댓글]
The dip is frequently referred to as a notch, and is common if you have noise exposure hearing loss, from what I understand! Were you around any extreme noise or worksites?

See an ENT*

Are you by any chance noticing fullness, or leaking a clear fluid from your ear at any time?

No idea I’m not a specialist.


you need an ent.

Is it possible you’ve had mild infections that didn’t bother you but caused slow damage making the loss unnoticeable?

I would get a second opinion if you can, I’ve never seen an audiogram where anyone’s hearing was exactly the same in both ears across all tones

This sounds like an auditory processing disorder (broad category encompassing variations in sound processing).

What caused the initial hearing loss that you said you treated? Did you have an infection?

I think that, for many people, APD is a lifelong condition. But it can be caused by things like strokes, seizures, trauma and repeated or severe ear infections. Maybe see an audiologist who is knowledgeable about it.

I'm aware that asking someone in this community is pointless because you guys are not doctors/professionals

1lggyct,hardofhearing,Feeling emotional,"Stuck, recently I found out i was hard of hearing, after feeling like I couldn’t hear for like 6-7 years, turns out, I’ve been hard of hearing all of my life, my parent just did nothing and never told me! Fast forward to today, my sons grade 8 graduation, and there was an interpreter there with a group of deaf parents, but I couldn’t go up there because it was for folks needing interpreter, but there was no spot for anyone who didn’t know asl, and was hard of hearing, I would of benefited from being closer to the mic, everything was so Charlie Brown and my hearing aids just were amplifying all the wrong things it felt like! It was uncomfortable for my ears! I know I missed a lot of what was said, because it was so loud in there and I’m pretty bummed out about it 

Stuck in between a hearing world who sees nothing wrong with me because I “can hear” and a deaf community I was never raised to be apart of , and I feel like a lot of resources for deaf and hoh= interpreters for a language I don’t know, I’m FRUSTRATED 

[댓글]
Hearing aids are not a cure-all. Unfortunately most of us hoh hearing aid wearing folks miss a lot. I am learning asl and would recommend for all hoh individuals to learn. For me my hearing has gotten progressively worse over time and know I may go completely deaf. 
We just have to do the best we can with what we have left.

Just dropping by to say my story is similar. I found out I was HoH when I was in my early 20s and I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with it. I decided hearing aids aren't for me after a few years. I want to learn ASL but the people in my life don't know it, so it feels kinda pointless. Lots to think about!

I took my first sign class about 11 years ago in a similar place to you, hard of hearing with no exposure to the Deaf community. It’s been a lot of hard work, but learning sign opened doors with no equivalent for me in the hearing world. In spoken language environments, even when trying my hardest, I will never be able access to the entire conversation; in signing spaces, dialogue was limited by my experience, not ability, with access being something I could fully unlock by working hard. It’s a process, but worth it, and people like us have a valid place in the Deaf community! 

Sounds like you already have sign experience, and just didn’t realize you were already “part of the club”. Now that you’ve been identified as hard of hearing, lean into it a little bit and explore signing with a new perspective. You belong!!

This is pretty common. Some people I meet I understand perfectly fine without hearing aids, others I don't.

Firstly, while you are frustrated, it is not your fault. It might feel like a social dynamic that you missed on, it is a physical condition that you have no control over.

There are different volumes and configurations for hearing aids that exist for mine. I have 4 different ones, depending on what I need (1:1 conversation, echoy room (the worst for me), traffic and group).

In the end of the day, sometimes I need to listen to a person for a week to know their speech pattern.

Just keep going. It feels stupid and you may not feel like there is progress, but there IS progress! Don’t give up. You can do this.  I’ll even help you if you want.

Start learning to sign. I promise you won’t regret it. It will take many years before you feel it’s really useful, but it’s so much worth it. Don’t let anyone talk you out of learning and don’t let any insecurity stop you. It will make you feel much better about being HoH.

If you live in a city, there are usually support groups for those who are hard of hearing on Facebook.  There are usually classes offered in ASL, as well.  Vocational Rehabilitation is a good resource for events.  Do some research… you will probably find online support groups, too!  Reach out. Find peers. You will be glad that you did.

Would love to take you up on that!",2025-06-20 22:28:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1lggyct/feeling_emotional/

I’m so sorry to hear your story. It’s a difficult disability to live with 😔 

I have mild to moderate loss. At your age, I could “mask” fitting in and wing it. Twenty years later, I cannot. Admittedly it’s not just being deaf - I have multiple physical and mental health conditions that have caused me to pretty much withdraw from society. But my deafness is a significant contributing factor. I have chronic fatigue, and am too tired to put the effort into hearing people. My mental health makes my mind race and exacerbates my tinnitus, I can’t even listen to family effectively. 

Hard as it is for an extrovert like me, I’m learning to live my own life as much as possible. I have some friends who are patient enough to keep in touch by text, which helps. I’m learning new hobbies (badly, mind), reading, gardening, just trying to be content with being Me. It’s not ideal, and I don’t think I could have done it at your age, but it’s all I’ve got. 

I hope you can find some good pointers on here!

Hi, I’m in the same boat as you. Profound hearing loss since birth pretty much. Everything you said is spot on. I’ve developed insecurities about my intelligence or so forth because I thought people thought I was dumb. Most of my social life was pre iPhone and social media/AIM, etc so it was doubly hard for me. I refused to wear my aids because I wanted to fit in and I was worried about what people thought.

But what changed it for me was just accepting it. When people saw my aids, they took a beat to make sure I could hear them. Some of the instances where people thought I was aloof were avoided because they saw the aids in my ears. I didn’t used to tell everyone about it but now I’m straight and up front about it and it became a huge nothing burger in the end.

As long as you keep your head up and put yourself out there, good things will happen. I promise people will be more understanding than you realize, at least the ones that matter.

My DMs are open too if you ever want to reach out.

Same here! Hearing loss since birth and been severly depressed since I'm 12.

This anxiety still persists after many years, but I actually make more fun of it.

Today I had an appointment, and a lady yelled across the room something I didn't understand. I said the date, and the guy behind me laughed and said ""What's your name"". It was funny to me, though it took years to decompress from this shame of spotlight.

It is less about what you CAN do (not hear properly) but more how you handle the situation. Hearing aids never fixed everything for me.

And the cool thing: I tell people I meet that I need a week or so for me to find out their speech pattern to understand how they talk until I fully understand them without me having them to repeat themselves. Which is absolutely true for me.

It's not always easy, friend.   
It takes a lot of strength to know yourself though, and you're showing a lot of strength reaching out. What I would suggest, as a person who is often suffering the same effects as you are, is find a therapist, or a counselor who can hear what you have to say. It's not that you need to learn how to deal, it's that you ARE dealing the best you can.

Social isolation, anxiety, depression are all very well known side effects of hearing loss. It's not that you can get better from it, but with someone to talk to, someone who listens to your frustrations, or even heck, lives the same can change your outlook dramatically. 

What I have found helps me in your situation (bipolar 1, generalized anxiety disorder), is to live unapologetically even with family and friends. I'm not saying you have to buy the t-shirt and hat that says, ""SPEAK UP"", just that you've done what you can and the ball is in the other person's or people's courts. 

The people that know you, you're allowed to just ask, ""Am I gonna have to remind you every time that I can't hear you properly?"" And just leave it up to them to feel bad about being an asshole. You're wearing your hearing aids, you're focusing on them when you know to focus on their words, everything else is their problem. If you didn't hear what they have to say, they effed up, not you. YOU have taken the time and effort to go get hearing aids, YOU turned to face them, YOU zeroed in on their mouth (I know you do it too... even if you can't read lips), YOU are extending a huge amount of energy to show them respect enough to try to listen to them. If they can't meet you in the middle on that, then that's on them. 

Crowds, damn. I suck, terribly at crowds, I admit it. A small help for me though, is how much I love to hear what I can. Some stupid little thing that I'd never be able to hear without my hearing aids, I'll focus in on that thing, a little jingle, or the radio in a passing car... That can lift my mood, because I genuinely love what my hearing aids do for me, and what they give me. Maybe try that, anxiety CAN be derailed in this fashion, even if it costs a little focus on the going ons around you. 

My DM's are open, friend, anytime.

F, 68, measles @ age 4 caused bilateral moderate loss.  This was pre- computers, pre-cellphones, pre-ADA.  I started out with body worn, analog hearing aids. Have, and still am, suffering all the things you said. I just cope best I can. It sucks. I have a lot of anger because of my hearing loss. I knew I was capable of so many things, but I missed so much that I came off as dumb. I know my life will soon be over (because I'm older) and I didn't get to make much of it because of this stupid hearing loss of mine. If only computers had been around when I was young. I'm short tempered in many situations. I cry often. I don't have many close friends and I prefer being alone. I loved my childhood. I was innocent of my hearing deficiency. I hated my life after college. Work relationships were hard. A year ago, I lost my central vision in one eye and can't drive well anymore.  Enjoy being young and just do the best you can. 💕 We can't change our lot in life.

Hi 👋 M34 here - my DM’s are open! I think that focusing and building a life around your strengths is going to be very helpful.

[댓글]
You have bilateral mixed (conductive plus sensorineural) type low frequency hearing loss. Most likely due to a genetic issue or cochlear hydrops plus some middle ear problem. Since this is bilateral, MRI is just for precaution. It will likely turn out to be normal. You might regain some hearing with intervention, discuss with your ENT, he would know best. Your right ear seems to be more affected. 

You need to work with a REALLY good audiologist for this type of hearing loss. This is a notoriously difficult loss for HA correction.

Seems like low frequency hearing loss (The dots on the lower frequencies are marked  lower down)

You have a low frequency loss. I have a (steeper) high frequency loss. But like me you drop off in the midtones where a lot if syllabels and speech sits. Im 33.

Heres a randomly googled audiogram, that has some oictures on it to help you gage what you struggle to hear. Compare your graph to it:

1le22eb,hardofhearing,Finally got a second opinion,"Kind of a vent with a question at the end.My original audiologist never answered any of my questions and apparently left out telling me I actually have mild sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Not just my left ear. I only found out from my child’s doctor telling me, which I feel weird about. I also found out that my QuickSIN results were Binaural: SNR-50 = 13.5 dB, Moderate Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) loss indicating significant difficulty with speech understanding in the presence of background noise. I wasn’t told at all, which is also weird because I asked about issues with background noise and all that happened was her giving me a sheet on how to tell people to repeat themselves and lower/pause the tv. Which didn’t really help since I can’t pause people in public. 
I finally got a second opinion because it felt like my concerns and questions weren’t being answered. My results from both tests were compared and confirmed to be accurate. After explaining my results in more depth, the first thing the new audiologist said to me was that I would benefit from hearing aids. Which I told my audiologist was interesting because one of the first things the other audiologist said was that I wasn’t and since then I’ve been struggling to try to understand what’s been going on sometimes. He actually seemed more upset than me about what information I wasn’t given by the previous audiologist. He did a way better job of explaining my hearing loss and what to expect. He also pointed out that my insurance fully covers hearing aids every three years. If I don’t like them I can always return them. That there won’t be a negative and that I’m not dramatic for wanting to be able to hear in public spaces. After being medically gaslighted my whole childhood it was nice to be told that it’s ok to use something that will help. 
My question is any advice on hearing aids? What I should expect and what helped?

Phonak has a wide variety of options. I am sure they have a pair that will fit your needs. Having them adjusted to your needs is the key for better speech recognition

So sorry you had to go through all that. I've got mild hearing loss with tinnitus and I've been using atom pro 2 for years. Nothing fancy, but it made everyday situations way less frustrating. It took some time before I get adjusted with the sound and fit so I'd suggest wearing them everyday even at home so you can adapt quickly.",2025-06-17 23:21:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1le22eb/finally_got_a_second_opinion/
1ldrqys,hardofhearing,New to hearing loss,"My husband (28) has been diagnosed with profound hearing loss. He has over 50% hearing loss in his left ear, and 30-40% in his right ear. We noticed the decrease in hearing about 3 years ago, and it has gotten worse. We saw an ent first who dismissed any sort of physical problem with the ear- no blockages, scarring or visible trauma or infection. She referred us to an audiologist. 

We had our first audiologist appointment yesterday, and they of course suggest hearing aids sooner rather than later, which we agreed to. 

We don’t have a known cause of his hearing loss at this time, and the doctor said by the initial visit there isn’t really a way to project what the future looks likes. Hopefully as they work together with follow ups and such, we can get more answers. 

The hearing aids will be in next week, and I am trying to compile a list of questions, but this is a whole new world to us. We are both generally healthy people from generally healthy families. I have no idea what to ask. 

We are a very average middle class family- we make to much for any sort of assistance- we have shit insurance- and aside from the initial shock of the cost of hearing aids we have no idea what else we need to look into or think about either now or in the future.

Make sure audiologist goes over care of hearing aids. My first pair I did not know there was wax filters or how to properly clean them. 
Hearing aids can be a problem in the wind and are not waterproof. 
I was amazed by all the sounds I was missing. 
Check out hardtohearit.com. April has a booklet that covers 20 things hearing people don’t seem to get about people with hearing loss. For a lot of us hearing aids aren’t the same as normal hearing but I am so glad I have mine. I am also learning ASL. 
Best of luck on your hearing loss journey

I’ve had a profound loss since I was six. I’m 42 now. 

Be prepared that your husband will have a huge adjustment wearing the hearing aids. His brain is going to have to learn what things sound like with the hearing aids. It can be tiring and overwhelming The more he wears them the better. Encourage him to leave them on but if he needs a break let him have one. 

Don’t be afraid to visit the audiologist many many times for adjustments. The more information your husband can give regarding what he likes and doesn’t like about the sound, the better adjustments can be made. He can keep a log during the first few days to jot things down. 

I would encourage you to start learning some basic sign language and getting involved with the local deaf community. 

This can be a process so just hang in there.

Find out how long you have to return them if not satisfied. Also, if he doesn't like the way life sounds, he should try a different brand. Each brand has their own sound processors which vary from each other. I've had 5 different brands over the last 30 years and I feel best with a specific brand and had to argue with audiologists to stay with that brand.  This is specific to each person. The brand I love, others have not liked and some love it too. I have friends who wear the brand I did not like. It's very individual. It takes a little time to adjust to hearing through hearing aids but if he has 3 months to trial them, he will know by then if he likes the sound or wants to try another brand. 

That said, they aren't hearing miracles. They should make things better but it won't be perfect. Without hearing aids my speech discrimination is 30%. With hearing aids, it's 60% in a very quiet environment. With noise, that score goes down. People often have unrealistic expectations with hearing aids, they have limits and I discuss that here in a post I wrote. [https://hearinglosslive.com/unrealistic-expectations-hearing-aids/](https://hearinglosslive.com/unrealistic-expectations-hearing-aids/) The good news is, if you know the limits, you can find workarounds. It took me 17 years to learn about those limits and was I ever mad. Audiologists don't tell us. The biggest one, hearing aids work best within 6 feet. Outside that range, their abilities start to go down. Some AuDs will say that it's up to 12 feet and that would be in quiet environments only. If it's really noisy, it might shrink to 3 feet. 

I also highly recommend a remote mic that pairs to the brand he buys. It extends hearing aid range. It's more money but it works good in the car, lectures and with noisy backgrounds. (Just be sure to go into the hearing aid app and shut off the environmental/ambient noise to get the most benefit.) 

I have a severe sensorineural hearing loss. It's mild in the low tones and plunges down in the high frequencies. I love my hearing aids and I wear them all the time but I've developed a ton of strategies to compensate for the limits.

I currently live with 3 people who are hard of hearing (husband, son, daughter). 

My $.02: understand how tiring working to hear will be for him. He may be utterly exhausted by the end of a day or social event and just need down time. 

In our family, there is lots of built in down time with no shame. People don't always understand just how vital that is. Ideas: plenty of sleep, alone time with show/movie, unplanned full days when on vacation in between the eventful days.",2025-06-17 16:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ldrqys/new_to_hearing_loss/
1ldjjql,hardofhearing,"I’m a deaf person in Korea who speaks, but I feel excluded from both the hearing and Deaf communities. Where do I belong","🇺🇸 English
[Intro] Between Two Worlds: Deaf vs. Oral
In South Korea, deaf and hard-of-hearing people are generally divided into two main categories:

• Deaf (농인): Those who use Korean Sign Language (KSL) as their primary language and share a cultural identity.

• Oral deaf (구화인): Those who use spoken language to communicate, often with the help of hearing aids or cochlear implants.

I don’t fully belong to either.
I was born with profound hearing loss—around 100 decibels. I can speak, and I’ve been trained to communicate orally. But I often struggle in daily conversations. I don’t use sign language fluently, and that makes me a stranger in the Deaf community. At the same time, hearing people often expect me to act like them—ignoring my limitations.
I live in-between, constantly explaining, constantly adapting—and constantly excluded.

[1] Privilege within the Deaf Community
Many deaf people in Korea today have received cochlear implants at a young age. They grow up speaking, go to regular schools, and later get jobs through disability quotas at large companies or public institutions.
They adapt well. That’s good for them.
But here’s the issue: many of them don’t acknowledge their privilege. They say things like:
“I worked hard, anyone can succeed.”
They see people like me—who still struggle to communicate—as just lazy or negative.
They enjoy the benefits of disability hiring, but act as if they’re fully ""normal,"" sometimes even hiding their deaf identity.
The media celebrates them as inspirational ""disability overcomers."" Meanwhile, people like me remain invisible, inconvenient, and excluded—even within the disability community.

[2] Even Deaf People Reject Me
I tried to learn Korean Sign Language and connect with the Deaf community. But when I made mistakes, I was often met with impatience or silence. Some people rolled their eyes. Others just ignored me. A few mocked me openly.
This rejection felt exactly like what I get from the hearing world—when I ask people to speak slowly or use clear lip movements, they often refuse.
Both groups seem to say the same thing:
“You’re too different. You don’t belong here.”
It’s exhausting.

[3] No Place to Breathe
I feel like I have no home.
To the hearing world, I’m too deaf.
To the Deaf world, I’m not deaf enough.
Even when I meet other deaf people, they often dismiss my concerns or say I’m overreacting.
It’s not just about communication. It’s about recognition. I want to be seen, not as broken or flawed, but as someone who lives between two worlds—and deserves dignity, too.

[4] This Isn’t a Rant. It’s a Survival Scream.
I’m not writing this to complain or attack anyone.
I just want to say:
If you are someone who lives in-between, who feels erased by both sides—you’re not alone.

🇰🇷 한국어 번역
[서문] 두 세계 사이에서: 농인 vs 구화인
한국에서 청각장애인은 보통 두 그룹으로 나뉩니다.
• 농인: 한국수어(KSL)를 주된 언어로 사용하고 문화적 정체성을 가진 사람들
• 구화인: 말과 입모양으로 의사소통하며 인공와우나 보청기에 의존하는 사람들
나는 어느 쪽에도 완전히 속하지 못합니다.
나는 약 100데시벨의 청력을 가졌고, 말을 할 수 있습니다. 말로 의사소통을 배웠지만, 일상 대화는 늘 어렵습니다. 수어는 능숙하지 못해 농인 커뮤니티에서도 이방인이 되고, 청인들은 나에게 ‘정상적인’ 대화를 기대하며 내 어려움을 무시합니다.
결국 나는 양쪽 모두에서 배제된 채, 항상 설명하고, 조율하고, 버텨야 하는 위치에 서 있습니다.

[1부] 청각장애인 사회 내부의 특권
많은 청각장애인들은 인공와우 수술을 받고 일반학교를 다녔으며, 장애인 채용 전형으로 대기업이나 공공기관에 취업합니다.
이들은 잘 적응합니다. 그것 자체는 좋은 일입니다.
하지만 문제는, 이들이 자신의 구조적 이점을 인정하지 않는다는 것입니다.
“나도 노력해서 성공했어. 누구나 할 수 있어.”
이런 말을 하며, 나처럼 의사소통에 여전히 어려움을 겪는 사람들을 게으르다고 치부합니다.
장애인 전형의 혜택은 누리면서, 자신이 청각장애인이라는 정체성은 감춥니다.
언론은 그들을 ""장애를 극복한 인물""로 추켜세웁니다. 그 사이 나는 보이지 않는 존재가 됩니다.

[2부] 농인들에게도 거부당하다
나는 수어를 배우고 농인들과 가까워지려 했습니다. 하지만 실수를 하면 짜증을 내거나 대화를 중단하는 경우가 많았습니다. 어떤 사람들은 눈을 굴리거나, 아예 나를 무시했습니다.
청인 사회에서 내가 입모양으로 말해 달라고 해도 거절당하는 경험과 똑같습니다.
양쪽 모두가 이렇게 말하는 것 같습니다.
“너는 우리와 달라. 여기 있을 자격 없어.”
그건 너무나 지치는 일입니다.

[3부] 숨 쉴 공간조차 없다
나는 갈 곳이 없습니다.
청인 세계에겐 나는 너무 ‘농’이고,
농인 세계에겐 나는 ‘농인도 아닌’ 존재입니다.
다른 청각장애인들과 이야기해도, 내 말은 “피해의식”이라며 묵살됩니다.
이건 단지 의사소통의 문제가 아닙니다.
인정받고 싶다는 기본적인 감정의 문제입니다.
나는 고장난 존재가 아니라, 두 세계 사이에서 살아가는 존재로서 존중받고 싶을 뿐입니다.

[4부] 이것은 푸념이 아니라 생존의 외침입니다
나는 누구를 탓하고자 이 글을 쓰는 게 아닙니다.
단지 말하고 싶었습니다.
만약 당신도, 나처럼 두 세계 사이에 끼어 소속되지 못하고 지워진 감정을 느낀다면…
당신은 혼자가 아닙니다.",2025-06-17 10:23:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ldjjql/im_a_deaf_person_in_korea_who_speaks_but_i_feel/

I’m not very social because of that. Conversations take effort, and most people don’t have the patience.  
Over the years, that isolation started affecting everything, not just my hearing, but my mind, my faith, and how I see myself.

I went through a short marriage that ended. It was painful for both sides.  
Since then, I’ve pulled back from everyone. I stay in one room, sit in one chair, work silently, and barely talk anymore.  
I get angry over small things. I feel like I’ve disappeared from life.

I’m not here for advice or attention.  
I just want to know if there’s one person who understands what it’s like to feel this way.

If the number isn't in the database yet, you can add it within a couple minutes.

Right now it only works with toll-free numbers, but we plan to expand to other customer service lines if enough people use it.

1lcz0bk,hardofhearing,Looking to collaborate: Short film on hearing loss,"Dear hardofhearing,

My name is Markus Simonsen, and I am applying this year to DFFB, the film school in Berlin. As part of the admissions process, I am producing a short docu-film (3 minutes).

I would like to focus on hearing loss – particularly the aspects that are often invisible to the outside world. In that regard, I wanted to ask if anyone might be interested in helping me to get in contact with people who is interested in participating, and sharing some experiences as a person living with hearing loss.

The film will not be an interview but a visual portrayal of how the world might be experienced from this perspective. It will only be shown internally to the school’s instructors and will not be made public.

I understand that this is short notice – the film must be submitted for editing by Thursday at 6 PM. I am currently in Berlin and fully flexible throughout the week.

Thank you very much in advance

What do you mean by ear crackling?

Peace to you in Jesus name

Try collagen powder drinks.

It is most likely from neck or some tissue muscle problem

I have just started collagen and may go back to physio

The Ent said it can be referred from Neck

They also same the Jaw

It definately is a nerve issue

Pray :)

Maybe we can get through it together

I tried otovent recently was scary

i am still doing research, as i also have a rash type on face from the ear

SO it can seem like allergy,

But mine is clogged/blocked all day + tinnitus

Not sure if a dentist can assist are your teeth and jaw ok?

DO you know when it started did you have accident/ stressful event

I know i did

So my faith has sustained me

Im hoping collagen will help and magnesium. 

If its the Jaw there is something called RAD JAW i have some and havnt had it in a long time .

Same nasal sprays etc did not work

1l9k08d,hardofhearing,Recognizing sounds needing your attention,"Have any of you tried any AI-powered sound recognition tools, like those accessibility features on the iPhone, Android, Samsung, Amazon Echo or other brands, to help with detecting smoke alarms, broken glass, running water, etc. What did you think of it? Do you like using them regularly?

[댓글]
I just activated the hearing devices and sound alerts on my Android and am... kinda... It thinks my overnight snoring was an appliance beep. Cool enough, it records the audio of the alert, and there's me ""snccchhhh... snncccchhhh..."" Uhm, that's not an appliance, that's a guy that could stand to lose about 15 pounds.

All in all, so far, it's been uh, interesting. Clearly the reliability is in question but it's still relatively new. I'm intrigued purely out of curiosity.

On iPhone for a small period of time I used the accessibility feature that flashes a white light on your phone when you get a notification. Eventually turned it off as I felt it looked like someone taking a picture with the flash on. I’d have my phone in my hand while talking to someone and a notification flash would go off. You could see in their face they thought I’d taken a picture of them.


I couldn’t see a way to change the colour or flash pattern. I remember having a second hand android back in highschool and it came with the light feature already on. It flashed at the front of the phone and the colours were different whereas the phone I currently have flashes white at the back on the phone near the camera. 


I often miss my phone when I’m out in public or sleeping which isn’t convenient. I set my ringer to be at its loudest and hope I hear the ping. I feel like it’s a weird learning curve figuring out what I can and can’t hear due to my type of loss

Tried it.  7 out of 10?

It gave me the notification for the sounds, but I don't really need most of them.

One thing I can't here in my home is the doorbell, if I'm not near it.  The sound alerts on Android did accurately notify me of the doorbell, but it also sometimes mistook other sounds for the doorbell.

I think it could eventually be great, and right now would be quite useful for some people in some situations.  I think it's benefit differs for each user.

I was 23 years old. I was in my bedroom and my roommate came in. He asked me how the clicking in my ceiling fan wasn’t making me crazy. I didn’t hear anything. I thought he was messing with me. We called in my other roommate and he verified that there was a loud clicking sound coming from the fan. I went to an ENT doctor and audiologist after that. They told me I had a serious hearing loss.  Before that I never would have guessed.

Stop listening to your music loud and start protecting your hearing (I assume citing living is loud). 


I think Covid set it off for me. I’d always been advised by my dr that I should watch my hearing and see an audiologist. Just after Covid I found myself struggling to hear at work. Eventually made an appointment with an audiologist who determined there was hearing loss.


He said I likely had it for a long time but my brain found ways to compensate so I didn’t notice. I figure I relied on lip reading more than I ever knew and people wearing masks impacted my ability to hear.

Contact a college where they teach audiology and they may need patients to practice. 

I know with massage therapy and optometry you can get service free or very cheap but it's from students but the professors oversee them so you should be able to get some answers. 

I have 2 types of hearing loss, congenital (born with it) and acquired (I did it to myself 😆). I don't remember what made me actually go get tested but I was like 23-24 and I went to a miracle ear office where they sell hearing aids and got a free test and once I started telling my close friends literally ALL of them separately were like ""DUH! Of course you're HOH."" Literally everyone knew but me 😂 how am I supposed to know what other people can hear?

It was a bit over a year ago (at age 24). I was lying in bed on my right side, ear in the pillow. My husband yells out the cats name - evidently she had been meowing very loudly in the hall, as she tends to do at night when she gets lonely (even though our door is open, lmao). I couldn’t hear her screams at all, unless I lifted my right ear off the pillow. I later took an online hearing test which said I had problems hearing. Not believing it, I had my husband and mother take it, and they both came out normal. (And my mother had her own hearing checked recently prior by her doctor) Some time later I went to an audiologist, and was told I had 50% reverse slope hearing loss in my left ear. Right ear is normal.

My old elementary school gave us free hearing and vision tests and that’s how it was confirmed. Before that I noticed every time I said some words no one understood me (the whole time I was hearing the words wrong and saying them the way I heard them) but ig what’s sucky is that you really don’t know until you’ve been told sometimes.

I was six. My parents noticed that I turned my boombox waaaay up.

I’ve known about the tinnitus since forever. I don’t realize how much loss there was until I met my (now) wife and she noticed I wasn’t hearing everything.

I had a sinus infection and as it was resolving tinnitus started. It never stopped. Still hasn't, only gotten louder and spread to the other ear. I had gotten ""normal"" tinnitus before that popped in and then faded out but never longer than maybe a couple minutes tops. Went to the audiologist/ENT combo and they found the cookie bite hearing loss. It's funny because on the paperwork you can see where he had circles eustacian tube dysfunction and then crossed it off as he realized it was more serious. 

Previously I had seen people's faces move while talking to ne in the printmaking studio and not heard anything, like at all. It was unsettling but it was not every time. So I sort of wrote it off as being a sensory issue since I also have those and there was a fan in that room to keep fumes from building up.

I left manhattan on a long get away weekend with my now husband then boyfriend to his family’s country house 20 years ago.  I remember I stepped into the quiet house and said to him” what the heck is that noise?” He was like,  “ what noise?”  It was my tinnitus ringing off the hook..",2025-06-12 01:34:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l9a4yt/how_and_when_did_you_guys_know_there_was/

is there a Vocational Rehabilitation in your area you can reach out to? they may be able to help you with finding/applying for accessible jobs or the assistive technology needed for work

I have the same issue. No phones or extremely loud environments. Prefer office. It's been tough for me too. Over 40+ applications for anything to pay bills. I'm there with ya.

I work for a very large, public company you may have heard of. When I filled out the online application, there was a section asking about specific disabilities and impairments and I ruminated over what to put here. In the end, I went with full disclosure and I did enter that I am extremely hard of hearing. I’m glad I did because this company has been wonderful in their accommodations. I’ve seen them also have smooth processes for people who needed special keyboards and chairs, despite the added cost and of course have been great with any ADA related requests that I’ve known about. This company is frequently included in the “best companies to work for” list that comes out every year and I am not surprised, they seem serious about employee welfare. I just wanted to let you know these places do exist and not to lose hope.

Are you in the US? I use Bluetooth hearing aids and live captioning for work. If you are in the US you have ADA protections and vocational rehab as resources. Vocational rehab in my state provides hearing aid, free college tuition, and assistance in identifying workplace accommodations.

My work has an app that will feed calls to my office to my phone, which in turn, directly feeds into my hearing aids and I can use the phone just fine with that capability. I don’t know your level of loss but maybe something like that could help? 

You could also look up the Job Accommodation Network and see different ideas for access to a phone with a hearing impairment.

Your mileage may vary depending on your level of loss and your communication preferences, but would any of the captioned phone systems or VRS work for you? 

I use a combination of over ear headset that plays well with my CI and captioning for calls, and quite a bit of my day is dedicated to calls. It works well enough to get the job done, for me anyway.

Can't understand scanner or radio traffic worth a damn and that's not been helpful.

Super, super proud of you. And after all that hemming and hawing about hearing aids you did... :P 

Told ya that you'd be astounded at what you didn't even realize you were missing. There'll be days where the noise is just far too much, and that's totally ok. Your ear holes will get sore and that's ok too. Take them out for a bit, don't over tax your mind and your ears. You've got so much new stuff to process, you'll probably be mentally exhausted by bed time the next couple days as you get used to them.

Keep going, live in a world you either forgot existed or are experiencing for the first time, enjoy it!

1l7odc3,hardofhearing,Closed Captions on DVDs,"Note - I posted similar content on r/deaf before I learned of this sub reddit. 

According to my research and interpretation, the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires all public facing video content to be accessible to everyone. Meanwhile the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) bridges the gap between old and new media. 

Which introduces my dilemma. 

Why are DVDs excluded from these two laws thereby renting, buying, or borrowing from the library?And why no organization or the government is doing anything about it?

I get it. It is more than assumed streaming content is the industry standard. VHS/Betamax is dinosaur technology. But isn't movie theater tech even older? Not everyone can afford the steadily escalating prices of streaming and the theater. But when reaching out to DVD companies, most wouldn't even respond, one did saying it was industry standard to classify captions like bloopers and ""on-demand"" was the direction where you get just the TV show or movie. Nothing else. Not even captions.

This is not only the case of watching a program from 50 years ago with a DVD release 25 years ago and not have the captions. This is now involving shows released this decade and not having the captions. When and why did ""accessible for all"" exclude people who value or have no choice but the DVD release? Especially since DVDs remain to be manufactured, just like DVD players this present year?

I have been questioned about my TV/DVD setup. Granted I do have a 17 year old TV/DVD combo, but before one chooses to say that is the problem exclusively, I was introduced to a Youtube video that showed someone purchasing a 2025 DVD Player that wasn't enabling the captions. So it is not simply user error as that video went in great detail about how this became a problem and leaving the deaf and hard of hearing behind with these omissions. Many players are responsible but for some unclear reason DVDs were exempted and I cannot get anyone to explain why.

So I have sought out advocacy organizations and politicians hoping to get better understanding of the existing omission as well as support to correct the problem. I have gone to ecommerce sites and read through many comments of people buying a DVD that listed as having captions only to not have them - and the product was non-refundable. And not available on any streaming network.

 Unfortunately, it has not been a pleasant experience getting advocates on this matter. One even stated they only watched movies through streaming almost as if to say not my problem. However the same person advocated open captions in movie theaters, so I did not understand the enthusiasm in one area and none in the other. 

I am coming here looking for guidance, input, and understanding. How to get interest and advocacy that supports both the deaf and hard of hearing beyond the voice of one for DVDs. Have you noticed this? Does this bother you or someone you know? 

Trying to open the conversation here...

Thank you.

It wouldn’t be legally considered publicly facing video. We’re granted captioned access to captioned videos at government owned sites (museums and anything else publicly owned) and employment videos to give us equal access to those things. If you were to purchase one of those things or for some reason were given a copy those would also have to come with captions. 

Whenever you buy a DVD copy of a movie or television show you’re no longer buying public facing video, you’re buying a licensed copy of a privately owned video. The government isn’t allowed to trample all over corporate rights and force them to caption copies of their media. It’s an inconvenience to have a closed caption decoder but the government likely will never step in when it comes to purchased media.

I don't have anything to offer here. But, I assume the YouTube video you mentioned is from Technology Connections. The video was interesting.

The only time I've had an issue is with third party sellers. My issue with amazon goes back far enough that I've refused to buy electronics from them, as well - no need to risk burning my house down because I missed the fine print on something that I could have bought from a reputable seller.

Not helpful, I know. This issue has burned my nerves for years but I don't have much else to add. :/

I saw the other thread. I gotta say I've been sailing the high seas for digital content as a means for accessibility for a couple decades at this point. Obviously not an ideal solution for the general public. (I still have a large DVD and Blu-Ray collection and pay for multiple streaming services) Streaming is a stop gap but I remember when I got Paramount Plus and the timing for all of the subtitles were so far off that it was unwatchable. I had to source other means even when I was paying money for it. They later fixed it. I also remember the early days of Netflix streaming when most of their content didn't have subtitles.

Legislation might help but I have no idea for how much longer we will have physical media.

I know it's not great but your best option might be a computer with a DVD/Blu-Ray drive and software that supports all caption/subtitle formats. I think VLC media player now has AI subtitle support. Subtitle files can also be easily found on the web.",2025-06-10 03:09:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l7odc3/closed_captions_on_dvds/
1l7ivbj,hardofhearing,Help! Hearing Aid Advice!,"Hi Y'all,

Recently my hearing aids got broke. It was my own fault unfortunately - I was doing the dishes and wanted to talk to a friend. Next thing I know my aids are drowning in a sink of dirty dish water. That said, my Insurance is refusing to cover replacements at the moment. They gave me some bureaucratic bullshit of only covering one every X years and that they 'Weren't a medical necessity for my life' (I can 'get by' in in-person conversations through a mix of lip reading and context, as well as being able to make out \~50% of words. I heavily regret saying that when I was first looked at but what can ya do...) so now... 

**I need some advice on Cheap Hearing Aids I can buy myself.**

I work with kids, I live in a rural area, I *need* to have my ears sometimes and I don't mind shelling out a bit of money, but at the end of the day I just don't have the funds to cover my nice ones again all on my own. Nor do I have the money to be shite at my job until my insurance comes around. Any advice helps!!! 

[댓글]
First of all, have you checked if you’re hearing aids are under warranty? My insurance covers hearing aids more frequently than my warranty runs out. If they aren’t under warranty, or the warranty doesn’t cover water damage, your best bet is probably Costco

Are you in the US? If so, you can check with your state's vocational rehab office for assistance. My state provides hearing aids and college tuition for deaf/hard of hearing residents that want to work or go to school. But you have to open a case and ask.

Alternatively, if you have an HSA or FSA account, you can use that for purchasing hearing aids. You will at least save money on income taxes.

Another option is to apply for CareCredit.

You can also check out CostCo. They will have the best pricing.

She has a text telephone assistance through an app on her galaxy pad where as she dictate a number to ring and someone the other end connects and then types( incredibly fast) the conversation from the person she rings. This is great.
 What we would like is to install an app on her tablet for speech to text  and use Bluetooth or wireless microphones to help when we are sitting with her for dinner or general conversation. Loads of apps available but my question is ( finally) what are good microphone/s to use . Have seen many setups with 2 or 3 rechargeable Mic's to clip on or hold with noise cancellation and a USB c sender plugged in to the tablet and also single Mikes which would then of course be passed around. Her audio specialist is great for hearing aids and stuff but at 95 her hearing is starting to disappear and not so much benefits from hearing aids.

You need to discuss with your audiologist about these issues. They will be able to help you out, if they can't I'd advise you to change your audiologist immediately.

1l3r2o4,hardofhearing,Dual language 4 yo with unilateral hearing impairment,"Hi there, I’m hoping someone can help and describe any experiences they have with dual language and hearing loss. 

Background information, my husband and I both work in education and educational research. We have a good understanding of the benefits of dual language and I have worked in bilingual schools for a long time. Our son will have an opportunity to go to a dual language 50/50 immersion school next year for kinder. I am really on the fence about it because he is in a preschool-8th grade school that he really loves. My husband and I aren’t fluent in the minority language, so he might have limited practice outside of school. I know he is capable of learning a second language but I’m not sure if this is the best route for him. 

Does anyone in this group have any experience with having a unilateral hearing impairment and doing dual language? 

What was your experience like? What things should I consider when deciding? 

[댓글]
I think it is important to consider his history with hearing loss which is missing here. What is the degree of HL, when was he diagnosed and how has he been doing since diagnosis? A child who is recently diagnosed, let's say, with severe unilateral HL  due to illness and still adjusting perhaps with HAs and someone who has had unilateral moderate congenital deafness will experience similar challenges differently. At 4, the kind of support will he be receiving from school and at home to facilitate his learning will be key.

I am also wondering about the two languages.

Dual language like English and ASL?

I have mild to moderate hearing loss, can generally hear deeper voices well, but not higher ones (so women and kids tend to be challenging). I learnt a second language as an adult to support a passion of my husband’s. Whilst I could read it quite well and speak it reasonably well (understandably but not quite accurately), I could never hear it. That left me fairly isolated unless they could speak my language fluently. 

It might depend on the level of loss your child has. I’m wishing I knew sign language in spite of the fact that my loss isn’t that bad on paper. Please keep in mind that your child will already have communication issues and likely feel isolated at times. How much more isolated will they feel not being able to speak the native language fluently? There’s a good chance that they’ll struggle more as they get older (a recent post discusses the effect of exhaustion and isolation from deafness, I think we were all in our forties as well). Might they benefit from sign language too? 

I’m absolutely not encouraging you to take one path or the other, I’m hoping to play devil’s advocate so you know what the risks are. I hope you can make the best choice for your child and your family ☺️

Hi there! I have a 4 year old with moderate unilateral hearing loss (just diagnosed) who is in a dual language immersion class.  She is doing wonderfully and there is no issue. My husband and I don't speak the language either.

The background is that my daughter has no history of speech and language delays and does well academically. Our audiologist said her hearing loss should not impact her participation in a dual language immersion program. She is slowly starting to wear her hearing aid and should be wearing it full time in September.

Can you speak with your Audiologist about this? Does your child have any speech and language delays? Are you also learning sign language? Will your child have a hearing aid? Does your child seem to have typical academic abilities for their age?  These are all factors to consider.

My son just turned 5 and sounds like a similar background in terms of hearing loss. Diagnosed at birth, hearing aids since 6 months. Severe loss in 1 ear, mild loss in the other ear. We mainly speak English at home (some Spanish, I am native but my husband is not) and live in a multilingual country. Neither me or my husband speak the local languages. 
He can speak 2 of the local languages, plus the local sign language plus English. He is starting to learn Spanish and the third local language. He has a hard time pronouncing some sounds but totally intelligible when he speaks. Sometimes he code switches to sign when he can’t find the word or is tired, sometimes he code switches to local language if it is something he learned at school and doesn’t know the translation to English. My point is - it is a beautiful multilingual mess and he is killing it!  Please please add sign language - I cannot tell you how beneficial it is for him. He has an interpreter that signs with him at school to get him used to that kind of communication for the future and he comes home to teach us new signs he has learned. Then we all say it in the languages we know. He learned sign before he could use words so it is super important for us to keep that going - signing was the first way he communicated with us and it changed our lives!

I was born deaf in my left ear in another country. When we immigrated to the US I didn’t speak a word of English. A year later I was fluent in it even though I wasn’t even diagnosed yet so didn’t have any help. A year later I was fluent in English because of being in school everyday. I wasn’t even diagnosed 9 years old at that time. I believe you should expose him to other languages as early as possible because it’s much easier for him to learn at an early age than to wait until high school or later. I have younger cousins born in America who learned both languages at the same time.

We have a 2yo with a similar hearing profile - also aided since 6mo. We are raising him trilingual - our local sign, English and Chinese. In our culture in my home country, having both English and a mother tongue is - while not 100% essential - helpful to connect with the rest of the community so most kids are raised bilingual from birth. 

He’s struggled a little with the tones (but so do most toddlers, anyway) but because we have sign, we sim-com (sign and speak at the same time) in the third language (Chinese) and that has helped tremendously.

Go for it! But also consider adding sign to that mix :)",2025-06-05 05:15:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l3r2o4/dual_language_4_yo_with_unilateral_hearing/
1l35rnk,hardofhearing,Learning ASL and signing through game!,"Hi everybody, I really hope I am allowed to post this here. If not, my apologies. I'm a 24 year-old student in The Netherlands finishing up my graduation and currently working on a game designed to help people get in touch with sign language. Through storytelling, for example, players will learn signs and how to use them. An educational game presented in an entertaining way. 

Here's the thing: **your opinion matters!** Although I do not have hearing problems myself, I find it extremely important to close the language gap between people that are HOH/deaf and people that aren't. With around 48 million people in the US experiencing hearing impairment and/or being HOH/deaf, how much representation do we see in the media? And how much easier could day to day life become if more people knew basic sign language? 

  
I have created a small form with some questions that would really help my research and game development. My goal is to create a physical/analog game, most likely with the use of cards. But as for now, I'm open to all possibilities. If possible, it would mean the world to me if you could fill in the form linked below and share it with others. Thank you so much in advance!

So why are you using ASL instead of SLN? Are you fluent in either? Teaching sign language when you’re not connected to the Deaf community and not fluent in sign language is very harmful to Deaf and hard of hearing people. There’s a reason your post was removed from r/deaf.

We are now back at square one trying to determine next steps. I was wondering if anyone has good input or advice when it comes to the Edit: ~~bone-anchored~~ bone conduction implant (the doctor mentioned Osia implants) compared to the hearing aids.

Also, I'd really appreciate hearing what it is like to live with unilateral hearing loss. It's really difficult to know if some of her focusing/paying attention challenges are her age, personality, or hearing loss.

Thank you

Whatever aid you choose. You must MUST 1000%.  To give her sign langague.   as the main langague or at least a hard 2nd. because her ears don't work. So that means hearing a langaugue  is pointless.  And even with surgery if she qualifies for any of those it will never be clear muddle sounding at best. 

There are studies and research that show that if you don't give access to sign langague then the reading and writing of English will never be on par. 

Deaf/hard of hearing high school who graduate. Graduate with a 3rd/4th grade reading and writing level of English. Newspapers are set to the standard of 8th grade understanding of English. 

I am hard of hearing and I have sensornal bilateral. Moderate level. And uses hearing aids.  Fluent in English and in sign langauge.

you may want to look into working with a teacher for the deaf/hard of hearing (TODHH) in your local school system. if your child is not in school yet, you can still reach out for a referral to early childhood special education. I am DHH (bilateral) and am also a TODHH, and have worked with a lot of unilaterally deaf students. I have one now, going into 4th grade, who is in the same situation as your daughter in terms of no auditory nerve on one side. he uses CROS hearing  aids and gets good benefit from those, but everyone is different. he used to wear bone conduction hearing aid, but his access to speech, especially in the classroom, is greatly improved with the CROS hearing aids over the bone conduction.

with unilateral hearing loss, difficulties with attention and focus can absolutely be apparent. it's already hard to pay attention to what people are saying when you are young, so add in that she is only hearing on one side and it's even more challenging. listening in background noise can be very difficult; filtering out background noise to focus on priority speech, like hearing your parents in a restaurant, can be hard. that's where it gets challenging in a classroom, too. also, difficulties with localization, or knowing where sound is coming from.
but again, a TODHH would be such a good advocate and resource for you!

best of luck with your child and this journey - I know it's a big adjustment and it can seem scary, but the DHH community is so rich and vibrant, and everything is going to work out. you're just going to have to be an active learner and a good advocate, like you already are doing, especially while your child is learning how to advocate on their own.

Our child is unilaterally Deaf. I can't speak to bone conduction, but have been doing this for many years now. Can share some of our experience. 

The symptoms of unilateral Deafness are very very similar to adhd, in our experience. Which was made even more difficult by a diagnosis of, you guessed it,  adhd. The main similarities were:

- sensory overload (need breaks from loud, busy places)

- fatigued after loud environment (needs quiet alone time after school or social event)

- missing instructions or parts of instructions (needs written instructions, rubrics, etc)

- not listening/hearing someone unless they get their attention first and they are looking directly at the speaker (needs preferential seating on correct side, reminders to teachers to get their attention bf speaking directly to them)

Some things specific to being Deaf:

- can't localize sounds, makes finding things difficult (beeping on ""find the remote/phone""), traffic (so stressful as a parent)

- missing initial/final sounds of words, made spelling and some articulation difficult

- mishearing words/phrases

If you're working with a children's hospital for services, I'd ask to speak with the social worker. They may be able to put you in touch with families in a similar situation to yours.

Whatever you end up choosing, PLEASE use sign language. My parents never bothered signing with me and I knew MINIMAL sign up until my freshman year of high school. PLEASE USE SIGN LANGUAGE. I have bilateral hearing loss and I wear hearing aids. I wish I knew more sign language because I struggle so much. Especially with remembering to charge my aids, then not being able to hear for the whole day. I definitely suggest learning from Deaf content creators if you don't wanna pay for an app. Never learn from hearing people

I was born with my left ear completely deaf. My family never figured it out and when I eventually figured it out myself that it wasn’t normal I never told anyone. The things to focus on is for school like her seating in the classroom should be where the teacher is on her “ good side”. It’s hard to understand what people are saying when she’s in groups and also in a loud area like a restaurant or a party. Build her self confidence so that she doesn’t shy away from asking people to repeat something she may not have heard. 
As far as Hearing aids the Osia implant is the most recent technology that will carry the sound through bone conduction from her deaf side to her hearing side and that will help her understand speech better especially when someone is sitting on her bad side. Once I was diagnosed I got what’s called CROS hearing aids. They are fitted in both ears. CROS stands for Countralateral Routing of Signal. The bad ear aid is a transmitter and the good ear one is a receiver. The sound on her bad side gets transmitted to her good side. It’s not so great in all situations. I used to turn mine off in crowds unless someone was sitting right next to me on my deaf side. 
Another thing to keep in mind is that with just one good ear she won’t be able to locate where sound is coming from. So if she’s walking down the hall and someone calls her name she might hear it but she won’t know which direction the sound is coming from. That’s most important when you’re teaching her about crossing the street. She needs to use her eyes more than her hearing to trust that there is no cars coming especially on her deaf side. When you’re at home and you are in different rooms and you call her for something make sure you have eye contact when telling her things, that will help in distinguishing what’s “behavioral” not listening to you versus she really couldn’t understand what you were saying from the next room. Mostly just enjoy your daughter any other child. Help her to understand that she may have trouble hearing but that she can depend on you to be ok when she asks you to repeat yourselves.

My nephew has severe hearing loss in one ear, and even with his hearing aid he can't understand people sitting on that side when they are talking. 

But he's lived a normal hearing life and has a Masters from Northeastern and a very good job. 

So while you should do everything you can to provide sound to that ear, and to protect the hearing in the other ear, I think that a fairly normal life is possible.

Audiologist here. 

For my unilaterally deaf patients I always recommend a trial with a CROS system first because you can always return the CROS. The Osia is also a power sucker and takes a 675 ""implant plus"" battery and it will only last 2 days per battery. Vs a traditional hearing aid battery which can either be recharged nightly or a replaceable battery that can be exchanged once every 5-10 days depending on battery selection. 

OP I'd personally go with a CROS system on trial basis first because she'll be getting the same benefits from either the Cros System or the Osia, except the CROS is non-invasive.

This is spot on. Been unilaterally deaf lol my life.  Much can be done for the child but mostly the family must also engage.  No more talking without eye contact, ensuring all family members take a full communication approach (sign and speech and body language) Socilisation for the child with other HH/ Deaf children.  Oh How I wish people knew this of me when I was a child in the 60’ and 70’- thought for years I wasn’t as smart or as normal as the other children. I wasn’t actually very intelligent as I manoeuvred this world by hearing only 50% - I remeber my attention wanning to the window or day dreaming when the teacher turned to the board … I failed miserably in school until I developed coping techniques.  Work with your child at finding coping techniques and focus less on the “technical solutions “

As a DHH teacher with a hearing loss, I found my students and their parents appreciated my perspective. Can your audiologist refer you to a group of individuals who have dealt with this?

[댓글]
Yes I do love my hearing aids but not in all environments, for example, in cars. Hate the extra noises like in my car the diff is noisy, which I can hear if I've got HAs on plus the ear facing the window gets all the wind noise but not the other ear so it's weird and unbalanced. Though unlike you they get rid of my tinnitus as I've got a tinnitus mask and it's been amazing to have breaks from that. It has taken a few adjustments at audiologist to get them how I like them though.

Yes. I've been thinking of not wearing mine permanently for this reason. All the rackety things intrude too harshly.

My hearing aids are fine if I use the Speech in Noise programme. I find they make me more able to tolerate background noise - unless the speech frequencies are amplified I get really stressed out by it.

I do find that my tinnitus is worse when I take them out. That's why I'm awake at this stupid hour. My audiologist told me that if I wear them all day every day it should improve, but sadly this hasn't been my experience.

I hate the sound of running water when I wear them. Without them it sounds normal, but with them on it sounds way too loud and hurts my ears.

How bout that sound of a raindrop hitting \*exactly\* on the mics for our hearing aids. It sounds like getting hit by a jello blob to me.

Yes, initially I was hearing all the odd sounds, but you will get used to it and suddenly you will be able to hear. It's weird, like one day I just started to hear right.",2025-06-03 15:16:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l2ejsm/hearing_aids/
1l1tvtg,hardofhearing,Kid doesn’t want to wear hearing aids,"Okay, so my kid (12M) hates wearing his hearing aids. I can usually get him to wear them at school with no problem, but lately it’s been so hard. 

He wasn’t born needing them— he had cancer at 4 years old resulting in high frequency hearing loss &amp; getting his hearing aids at age 5. The hearing aids are super cool with Bluetooth and everything else. He claims he can hear just fine without them, but it’s hard for me to fully understand what he can or can’t hear based off of the audiogram and since he claims he doesn’t need them, he isn’t the greatest about communicating what he actually hears or not. And also like he’s 12, so are you not hearing me or are you just not paying attention? Lmao.

Anyways, he plays baseball (all the way out in right field) &amp; I tried to convince him to wear them out there because I think it’d help him hear whatever his teammates are communicating and/or when he’s running bases. He says the wind is too loud with them in?

What I guess I’m asking with this post is, should I force him to wear them? I don’t really want the “you’re the parent and he’s a child” stuff. I know, but I also want to understand where he’s coming from. I want him to know I am listening to him. Can someone else with high frequency hearing loss maybe explain this to me? I also think some people assume he’s fully deaf when they see his hearing aids or ask kind of stupid questions, which probably pisses him off. 

EDIT: Thank you for all of your inputs &amp; sharing your experiences with me! I tried to attach a link for his recent audiogram.

I was born deaf, got hearing aids at five years old. I wore them most of the time but when I hit teenage hood, I too felt like ""I could hear fine without them.""

The truth was no, I could not. I think it's a rebellious thing. You kinda wanna prove that you're cool/tough/independent enough without them. Something like that. You don't actually think about your motivations, you just decide not to wear them and feel irritation at the thought of it and you're not sure why. 

In my case, my friends would get so angry at me for not wearing them because I would ask them to repeat stuff all the time and they would have to speak up a lot. I also ended up missing a lot of stuff in class and at events.

I got to a point in late high school/early university where my fear of missing out on things won out over my rebelliousness. Also, my desire not to piss off my friends.

I wear my hearing aids all the time now (when I'm out with people anyway, at home I prefer the peace and quiet). I'm in my thirties by the by. 

This is just to say, you might need to let him mess up a little. He'll either learn that he doesn't like going without them or be very stubborn until it becomes a genuine problem but if you force him to wear them, he'll bear a grudge against you and resentment towards the aids.

That being said, a little pushing is fine. I've been accused of being too acquiescing sometimes so take my advice with a grain of salt.  

Best of luck to you. I hope kiddo gets the message sooner than I did.

I'm sort of confused as to why he would need to be ""forced"" to wear them. I'm young, 21, have had a severe-profound high frequency loss since the age of 5, and have gotten through my life reasonably fine for how dramatic my loss is. People are shocked to find out that I even have a loss. Do you happen to have a picture of his audiogram that you can attach? We'd be happy to help interpret it for you.

High frequencies are tied to consonant clarity (i.e., s-, sh-, f-, ch-, etc.). People with high-frequency losses can still hear and understand a large portion of speech, especially with added context. 

There's really not enough context here to suggest anything about your son specifically. It could be tied to being embarrassed for having HAs at his age, improper programing that needs to be adjusted with an audiologist (wind reduction features exist in most modern HAs), or that they simply don't provide him with any ""huge"" benefits, so much so that the benefit isn't worth the embarassment/discomfort.

The best thing you can do is ask questions. Have him write down a list of all the things that are too loud, too quiet, too annoying, or too emphasized; with that list, show it to an audiologist who can interpret it and make proper changes in the programming software.

The wind is too loud with hearing aids. Its annoying as shit. Also the hearing aids introduce a degree of latency which probably prevents him from estimating direction/distance. If he wants to leave his hearing aids out thats his decision and you should respect that

Have you gotten a second opinion on his audiogram and hearing aid settings? 

Our teen was telling us the HA did nothing and the audiologist kept telling us the audiograms with vs without the HA indicated it was working. The ENT suggested CI based on their testing, so we compared. The audiologist was actually FLIPPING the results. The HA literally did NOTHING.  I'm not suggesting this is happening, but your child is telling you they don't want it for a reason. I'd rule out functionality of the HA.

As someone who got hearing aids at 10, 32 years ago now:

Sometimes they are exhausting. Wearing them all day is exhausting and listening to people is absolutely exhausting.

As a hearing aid wearer and have played baseball around that age, you should be asking yourself if the team player are communicating with him without the dependency of hearing aids (visual cues or sign language, etc) because whatcha gonna do if the hearing aid batteries are dead or if it’s too windy to be able to hear anything or if it’s light rain, you expect him to wear hearing aids?

The hearing aids are for situational awareness, not for you to overly rely on him to accommodate your communication preferences because it’s convenient for you instead of useful for your son. 

By the way, some audiologists can mimic his experience with wearing hearing aids and if they’re unable to, then wear airpods all the time to get a slight sense of where he’s coming from.

There can be several factors playing into this. Is it possible he really doesn’t need them? Maybe. But around this age especially wearing hearing aids and being different is hard, and a lot of hearing aid user (myself included!) went through a “phase” where I resented having to wear them and went without. It’s also possible he needs an adjustment or especially playing baseball the wind static can be a lot. I’d encourage you to follow up with audiology and make sure the settings are okay. Try to have an honest talk with him about if hearing loss is making aspect of life difficult- if people have commented negatively on his hearing aids, if he’s missing things in class or conversations, if he doesn’t wear them to people get annoyed with him asking to repeat things, etc. I worked on peds oncology for a while and definitely can get that sometimes once in remission, kids want to be as normal as possible and don’t want anything else drawing attention to them. There are a lot of options now to customize hearing aids and make them more fun. As an adult, the embarrassment has worn off and I like wearing them when I can make them look a little more fancy! This is a shop I love: the covers block out wind/ static noise and they have baseball themed covers your kiddo might like!!

I'm in my 30s and also have high frequency loss. In my 20s tried wearing hearing aids for a few years, but ultimately decided not to keep wearing them. A few audiologists have told me this is common for loss like this, because while hearing aids CAN be tuned to only emphasize some sound, they are best used to amplify everything. So if you have normal hearing in some frequencies...hearing aids can still work, but they can be annoying. There's no better solution, though. Maybe better tuning like a few other commenters said but for me, over 2 years, tuning didn't seem to matter. When I pointed out that wind crackling was annoying or speech in restaurants was louder without being clearer, they said that's just how it's going to be, and I can mess with the app settings or whatever for the situation. For me, that wasn't worth it. 

All that said, I would try making him stick with it for at least a couple years. There's a learning curve to hearing with aids and you want to make sure he's given them a fair shot.

I relate to your kid. I had hearing aids since I was in 9th grade, and at the start I wore them outside and at home. However, wearing them outside didn't last long because some sounds hurt my ear e.g. honking of cars, church bells, etc. I also found that I can get by fine without them cause most of my loss were in high frequency sound. I was also conscious of wearing them in public. 

During the pandemic, I began to wear them again in public because I thought it would help me hear people even if they have face masks on (I can't lipread cos I can't see their lips). But, that wasn't the case. It only amplified the sounds and did not really help me understand what people were saying. So, I just didn't wear them at all. When the use of face masks eased, I absolutely saw no reason to wear my hearing aids at all because I could get by fine. All these times, my mother also kept reminding me to wear hearing aids to the point where I also felt that my choice to not wear one isn't respected. It became annoying because my mother couldn't understand that my hearing aids don't work for me, I just get irritated and tired of the loud sounds I hear. I prefer the quiet. My mother also didn't seem to get that it only amplifies sound and doesn't help me understand people when I can't read their lips. My audiologist as well kept pushing me to wear them even though I already said these same reasons to her. Overall, it was very frustrating when people kept forcing me to wear them when they can't understand the reasons why I don't.

Eventually, my old hearing aids broke and I have to get a new one. The audiologist, of course, suggested me a new hearing aid. But, I was on the fence about getting them because not only were they expensive, but also I still had the thought that they won't help me much—there isn't a difference to wearing hearing aids or not because they still only amplify sounds and not help me understand people who have face masks on.

Not until I met a new audiologist, and there I found hearing aids and the settings that work for me. I finally saw how the hearing aids were supposed to aid me, which wasn't clear to me before with my old hearing aids and audiologist. With my new ones, I could finally engage in conversation with people who have face masks on at any distance. That's all I ever wanted really, and I cried when I finally got to experience the real benefits of the hearing aids. The background noise was also toned down, which really helped because BG noise can be the main source of fatigue or irritation to people with hearing loss. Now, I'm now more amenable to wearing hearing aids, as I can finally see their purpose and how it serves me.

Maybe your kid feels the same. That's why I agree to get a second opinion on a different audiologist or fine tune the hearing aid settings to adjust to your kid's needs. Let him test different hearing aids/settings! Your kids feelings are valid, he just needs to explore more options and see what works for him and doesn't. If it still isn't for him, I think you should respect that.

Is wind noise the only reason why he doesn’t want to wear them? Do they make him “feel different” and this is avoidance? Is he getting bullied?

As a hearing aid wearer with the same type of hearing loss, I think you should talk to him. He might be a teenager, he might hate you but there's nothing as sad as silently losing your hearing. 
I'm 24, I got my hearing aids at 19 and the campus fun and stuff made me hate wearing them. After all my friends were accommodating and they understood me. But in hindsight I wish I wore them. In those around 4 years of not wearing them, I've lost a significant amount of my hearing that will never recover. So now I try as much as possible to put them on and benefit fully from them. 
And it's hard fr, I hate the fatigue. I left my job so I could just sit and relearn how to hear💔so I do give myself some grace and breaks. But I hope it gets better.

It sounds like his hearing aids need to be adjusted by his audiologist. They're probably picking up/emphasizing the wrong sounds - like wind - instead of his teammates' voices. Explain all of this to the audio.

~~Not wearing them obviously isn't and shouldn't be an option.~~ Thanks to everyone who posted their own experiences. 

Also, he's 12 and kids suck, so that doesn't help. Some of them might be genuinely curious, but others are probably being little assholes.

Edit: Why was this downvoted? People on Reddit, I swear!

How frequently does he go in for tunings, and do you go with him? I would take note of how descriptive he is when his audiologist asks for feedback. Does he have a program that's optimized for the listening situations where he's reluctant to wear his HA?

I was 8 when I got my first pair. I was 12 before I started wearing them regularly. Kids go through adjust and rebellion stages, especially in the world of social peer pressure and desire to fit in. Let your son learn the hard way while he is young and has your support and supervision. My parents stopped nagging me and just let me be. And I got a teacher who was so soft spoken I couldn't even hear the quiz questions let alone write down the answer. Aftet the second test being graded 0/F, I put on my hearing aids and kept them on at school. 

I do sympathize with his complaint about wind though; it is bloody annoying and overtakes any speech. I am a rower and I chose to not wear my HAs when working out. But instead of trying to go to the audiologist to tune the HAs, take him to the appointment and tell him it is up to him to troubleshoot and problem solve with the audiologist. And maybe the solution they come up with may be to not wear HAs but for him to work with his coach and team to ensure he can communicate as a team member. Either way, it is a good learning opportunity for him to work through his hearing adjustments and needs with professionals himself.

Sorry for the length, I'm not very good at reddit. Everyone's experience is definitely different. I agree that communicating with him directly about why he doesn't like wearing them is super important. 

I just got hearing aids in my 30s, but honestly needed them around 15 or so. I am still shocked with how much they changed/improved my life.

I love my hearing aids and had no idea just how much I wasn't hearing all the time! I also didn't realize how often others were having to repeat themselves and how much energy and frustration went into communication. 😞 I would love to go back in time and get them sooner. 

They do have several drawbacks. Wind is a huge issue for me. Mine do have Bluetooth which is great, but I can't have phone calls outside because the mic picks up so much wind noise. Not only is that noise unpleasant and annoying and makes it impossible to hear anybody, it is actually painful to me [and to those on the other line who can also hear it]. My hair also touches the mic constantly. I've given up and now wear my hair in bandanas or ponytails or both 100% of the time. The constant rustling sound is actually maddening! It gives me weird anxiety and it is frustrating and exhausting to constantly have to deal with that. The mic even as advanced as it is, squeals when anything gets close to it [which can be embarrassing socially and also physically painful] If he's wearing a helmet, it wouldn't surprise me at all if he gets squealing/feedback/whining noises regularly and is over it.

Another factor might also be that when you wear them, at least for me, I couldn't tell what some sounds even were at first! [Like the AC kicking on, the ice maker dropping ice, cars passing outside, I hadn't really heard any of it for a long time, so I was constantly feeling crazy! Like, wtf is that sound!?! My husband had to answer a ton of questions about sounds in my first 6 months wearing them. It may also be that the sounds are unpleasant, overstimulating and loud in a way that's not helpful. A ball game has insane levels of noise! I don't think I would wear mine in that situation. Bc all the b.s. noise will drown out what I actually do need to hear.

Lastly, my dad and his mom had profound hearing loss. They both refuse/d to wear their HA. For them they got so used to the quiet that the aids made every thing way too fucking loud. He likes his peace and quiet. My mom is a shouter. The aids would help him talk to others, but everything [including her] is just way too loud for him. He nods and pretends he understands. I know his face well so I can definitely tell when he is connecting and when he is not. He also was very aware how expensive they were and after losing a pair at work in an accident he refused to ""waste money"" on that again.

If you can find out what he doesn't like about them, the audiologist may be able to make adjustments. If they don't fit well and make his ears sore, they can do custom moulds of his canal. If he's getting rashes and itching ears he may need to replace his ear cushions more frequently or even get treated for skin infections. [I get dermatitis &amp; sometimes mild fungal infections from mine and have to use cream every few months to clear it up]. They may need to adjust his sound balance and work on making speech clearer and background noise less in the forefront. 

A lot of people think that hearing aids fix everything with sound, but they really only amplify things. Even with my aids I still have to read lips. I still sit so that the quieter friends are on my ""good"" side. I have to ask ppl to turn their music off bc if they're talking, I can't understand them over even quiet background music. It's honestly frustrating with or without the aids. It's exhausting with or without them. So if he's fed up, he may also just need a break all together from them. I've started taking sound breaks lately bc I'm just so irritated by everything around me.

I hope you both can have some good conversations about his experience and what he's going through. As a cancer survivor, he may also just crave a sense of ""normalcy"" and wearing his aids could be a constant reminder of everything he went through already. 

Best of luck!

hi, not really advice but perspective. when i started middle school i did not want to go in being the glasses / braces / hearing aid girly so i begged my parents to not wear them. we ultimately landed on if i kept up good grades i didn't have to. i went from 13 to 21 without hearing aids. it wasn't until a college course that i really could not understand a teacher that i decided to pursue them again. i was mortified when i finally got them. it had been so long i forgot what it was like. i realized then how difficult i had made life for myself. i have no idea where i could be had i just worn them, i think my life would be incredibly different. HOWEVER, though i regret the possibilities and lament over the unnecessary struggle i made myself unwittingly endure, i am still a successful person with a happy, and loving, social life. at the end of the day i don't think my parents could have done anything differently, i dont even associate them with my decision not to wear them, as it was my own decision, 12 y/o or not.

I can back him up with the wind being loud, the wind is very loud. This is how I explain hearing aids to people, is that imagine your hearing everything through a radio or phone all the time, you can get feedback (for example whistling, though I don’t think you should be getting it normally, but it can happen is somethings wrong with the hearing aid and you don’t know it), if anything rubs against it you can hear it, and you can definitely hear the wind. I’ve taken my hearing aids out so many times because of it.

I think you shouldn’t force him to wear it. I can’t speak too much for childhood (I only got hearing aids like this year at 19) because Ive had hearing loss all my life but I never wanted to get hearing aids, only because I thought they’d be a sensory nightmare for me (I wasn’t too wrong but I was deffo being dramatic😂), but no one forced me to get them, which I was very greatful for. It’s the same with glasses, I had them but no one forced me to wear them.

My parents were quite neglectful with a lot of things that I needed as a chronically ill child but one good thing is that they always gave me a sense of bodily autonomy. If anything was happening to me, for example getting an xray or a scan or a cannula, they would make sure someone explained what was happening and why they were doing it. With things that were optional they allowed my input and took it into consideration (one thing was braces like knee braces and such, I didn’t want to wear them but we talked and they and my PT figured out it wasn’t the actual braces, it was the colour, so we got colourful braces instead).

The best thing you can do is try explain why he needs them, but if he doesn’t want to wear them allow him to have that choice. I know personally that if braces or glasses or hearing aids were forced on me then I wouldn’t wear them now.

(I also want to add that everyone has different experiences with things, this is just my personal experience)

A possibility- if he’s not interested in the HAs, he could explore ASL and learn to embrace his lack of hearing. Could be beneficial down the line if the hearing loss progresses as well.

Hearing aid skins can help cut down wind noise, they also help repellent dirt, sweat, and moisture. Your son can pick out his favorite color or print to have some fun. Could make his devices a little more appealing- if that works they sell ear tubes and such, mine are bright green and I love them. People don't even realize they are hearing aides half the time.  (I have posted them on my profile before)

Search hearing aids on etsy for ways to have fun/dress up you son's. He could pick out device safe stickers, etc.

When I was 11 around the same age I got my first pair of hearing aids too but I didn’t put up a fight because I knew I needed them and I was quite grateful and happy, I’m 16 now. Your son is just being a brat lmao.",2025-06-02 21:13:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1l1tvtg/kid_doesnt_want_to_wear_hearing_aids/

I can't hear on the phone anymore. People don't seem to understand how to accomplish things without one, though. I have to get family to call for me but they don't like it. Sucks.

Bluetooth hearings have helped me somewhat. It’s still a challenge. I sometimes use Caption Call if it’s a very important call…but some people get annoyed by the delay in answers while I wait for their dialogue to be captioned.

Not a huge fan of phone calls. my difficulty with them was one of the clues. 

The caption app helps, but my hearing aids are wonky with bluetooth - they use the HA microphones, which work kinda okay in a totally silent environment, but if there's any noise at all, the person on the other end can barely hear anything I say, so... not ideal.

I sometimes tell people I am hard of hearing and use a captioning app, but then they just talk to me like. I. can. only. use. small. words.

Time to sign up for an IP relay. You are exactly who the system is made for.

I use Bluetooth feature for my calls (phone and laptop). I can’t otherwise hear great. I love closed captions when possible as well.

I wish I could text to make appointments, it drives me crazy. I have to put it on speaker too just to properly hear people. And for whatever reason whenever I try to get a job, they often want to interview me over the phone before the next interview step.

1l0u70t,hardofhearing,Left ear feels clogged but it's not and I'm extremely dizzy,"So about two days ago I woke up and my left ear felt a bit clogged, so then I tried to get the earwax out and there was none of it. I figured it would go away eventually and so I just went on with my day. Then yesterday I woke up and my head was spinning, I could barely walk, I was tripping over anything and I felt nauseous. I had to lay on my bed staying a as I possibly could for the dizziness to stop even a little, but everytime I moved my head I felt like I was spinning in circles. 

Eventually, I vomitted and it helped me feel better, but I was still a bit nauseous and dizzy. At the end of that day I noticed that my ear still felt clogged. I figured I slept on it wrong(that's happened before), so I went back to sleep once again expecting to feel better in the morning. 

  
Now, it's the morning, and my ear feels even more clogged and I can barely hear anything out of it. Sounds going to that ear sound muffled, yet loud. I can barely hear my mom talking to me through that ear, but I can hear the unusually loud sound of my pillow cover rustling whenever I move a bit.

I also can't walk that well today but I don't feel as dizzy as I did yesterday. Im not sure what's going on. If anybody can help that would be great

Sounds like an inner ear infection but I'm not a doctor so yeah, go see a doctor.

Go to the doctor.

go to the doctor. reddit aint a doctor. we just genuinely dont know enough to help you here.

There's also a condition where the crystals in the inner ear get out of place and cause nausea and dizziness.  They need repositioning and you have to find someone who knows how to do that.  You can also learn how to do it yourself.  It sounds fake and weird but I have a friend who has this happen every once in a while and it's a real pain.

1l0k2s5,hardofhearing,Hearing issues 6 months after an ear infection,"Back in November, I got very VERY sick. And part of getting so sick was a double ear infection. I'd never had an ear infection quite as bad as this. I lost around 90-95% hearing in my right ear, and probably 50-60% in my left. I could only slightly hear some things with one ear and it was constantly uncomfortable, for about 10 days. I know that's nothing compared to what some of you deal with. But I play music, and I have major depression, and all I did was have claustrophobic panic attacks and cry my grown man ass off all day. 

Eventually, my ears started to open up and I getting them to pop and drain a bit and regain a good amount of my hearing felt like reaching the summit of Mt Everest. But eventually the progress stopped. My ears, especially my right ear, which was the worse one, have still felt full. My nose still feels full. A portion of my voice never came back. I can hear most things okay, but my own speaking is wildly uncomfortable in my own head. It vibrates my inner ear like I'm biting down on an electric toothbrush. 

I feel like it's time I do something about it, and see a doctor. And I suspect that will lead to tubes in the ears. But I've read so many stories, posts and comments here, etc. about complications from it, longterm effects, scarring, and the process itself going wrong, or not helping, or making things even worse. And most of the positive comments seem to be along the lines of ""It gets better in 6-10 months!"" No effing way. 

Moreover, I have type 1 diabetes AND lupus. (Is it any wonder I got so seriously sick back in November?) It takes me so long to heal from anything, and even a paper cut leaves a scar on me. I'm already dealing with a couple other unknown ailments that doctors seem to unable to figure out (I have appointments with the 6th AND 7th doctors currently) I'm really just fatigued, depressed, and outright drained from how bad things have gotten and the thought of putting tubes in my ears is something I don't think I can mentally handle, especially with elevated risk of major scarring and permanent hearing loss. But my right ear staying like this isn't what I want either. 

I also haven't felt like many doctors have considered how I feel. Not to shit-talk medical professionals, but I have medicaid and I sometimes feel like I'm subject to more unrelated tests and ineffective treatments than are necessary because they will 100% be paid for, even if it means I have to get more needles, more pokes and prods, more pills, etc. and ultimately come out the other side with no improvement. ESPECIALLY with my medical history of lupus and type 1 diabetes. I've developed trust issues, I suppose. 

So. Would tubes even be necessary? I don't see any other methods of dealing with this mentioned anywhere at all. I already know I can't handle losing more hearing, even if temporary. The claustrophobic meltdowns are sort've unavoidable for me from some weird CPTSD-like stuff that I won't get into.

Am I overlooking anything? Are my only options stay sorta deaf or risk going way deafer but maybe a better someday? I've felt beyond hopeless for so long and my mental health is basically nonexistent at this point. Advice is appreciated!

1kzn0jh,hardofhearing,Why do people talk so dang much‽ ‽ ‽,"I have been bombarded lately with people talking at me (not to me, it's never a conversation) about things that either don't matter or giving me every single excruciating detail about something. 

My friends invited a person I'd never met to tag along on some adventures and I swear he never once stopped talking. I don't know how he was even breathing, there was never a gap in his yammering. 

A coworker always fills me in on needless details that don't matter and gives me word by word playbacks of conversations. She KNOWS I'm HoH and struggle with speech recognition. But, still, she yaks on and on! 

And lately, a family I love dearly has been talking incessantly about people I've never and will never meet. She goes into great detail about things that happened to these folks and it literally adds nothing of value to our conversations. 

And this is all on top of other people just blabbing away in my life: strangers, store clerks, customers at work, etc. 

It is EXHAUSTING to listen to people talk. I remind people all the time that it's mentally taxing to hold a conversation. But they still never shut up. I feel like I'm constantly bombarded with information and I just want to go live in a cave away from others and never have to hear another person say another word ever again!

1kyxzrj,hardofhearing,Too young to feel this old,"I was born with hearing loss, and I'm turning 40 this year. 

My hearing loss is significant, but my parents were instructed not to have me learn sign language, so I was raised in the hearing world as a hearing person. When I was younger, I had more energy to keep up on conversations in loud places and crowded settings, but this has been changing in the past few years, compounded by the fact that my hearing continues to decline. It doesn't help that the restaurant industry has trended forward industrial designs that increase the volume of noise.

I was talking about this with a coworker who also has a significant disability. It started with me saying, ""I know I'm not old, but I'm too young to feel this old,"" and she immediately affirmed what I was saying. When I say this to most people, I'm immediately met with, ""You're not old,"" and the exasperation and skepticism remain even when I explain where I'm coming from. Learning that someone else feels similarly, I wondered how prevalent this feeling is among other people. 

Every year on my birthday, as a little ""joke"" for myself, I do the math on how many pay periods I have until I retire. The number is ✨not✨ small, and it makes me laugh to see just how young I am in the grand scheme of things. This isn't me complaining about being old because of an arbitrary number; this is me feeling overwhelmed by auditory and visual stimuli to keep up with people. And it's me realizing more and more just how much more work I've always done to follow conversations. It's an entire life lived like this, and having to repeatedly explain to people what I missed and what would help me so we can have a good conversation. I didn't realize just how much I was doing until I was talking to a friend about a job posting I saw that required ""normal hearing"" (nothing in the PD would require this, so I found it odd), and she responded, ""well, with hearing aids, you have normal hearing."" I was initially angered by this until I realized that she really couldn't tell how hard it is for me, because I perfected the art of lip-reading and analyzing missed sounds at such a young age.

Of course, it's a natural part of hearing loss. It's what we do to live and thrive. But the realities still hit harder after intense days of big meetings, reading captions on virtual calls, reading lips, so on and so forth. It's not something I dwell on, but I do share my feelings when I'm in a comfortable setting with people that I think will understand me, just to realize that they can't ever truly understand me.

So, really, I think this is me trying to connect with people who have hearing loss, because that's not an opportunity I was ever presented with as I was growing up. Awhile back, I was talking to the same coworker about the occasional breakdowns that come with wishing I didn't have hearing loss, which is such a fundamental part of who I am, and how ugly it can feel. She put it perfectly when she said that we can celebrate our diversity and differences, but we should also be able to talk about grief and lament.

I'm curious if anyone else feels similar or has other insights to share. ",2025-05-30 07:16:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kyxzrj/too_young_to_feel_this_old/
1kysnc3,hardofhearing,Tinnitus and hearing aid white noise,"For any of you experiencing subjective tinnitus about to get hearing aids, ask your Oto/audiologist about it. They'll likely say what mine did ""I'll fill your head so full of sound that you can't hear it anymore."" And for the last 3 years, he was right. My hearing aids closed the gap, and it was bliss.

I'm finally giving in though now that my handy dandy anxiety has maxed out what my hearing aids used to handle no problem. (I've come to find out that emotional and mental states, blood pressure, a whole pile of things have an impact on tinnitus) I have an appointment with my audiologist to discuss and activate the white noise on my hearing aids.

It used to be that the hearing aids covered what I've always referred to as high pitched tape hiss (for those of you that remember tape hiss). Otherwise known as tinnitus. Ringing in ears is FAR too general a phrase for tinnitus, cause, it just doesn't sound like ringing. It sounds like a high pitched fizz to me. And lucky me, my right ear and left ear are almost always JUST out of phase with eachother.

My audiologist is a bit standoffish and when I asked about it at my last test, we never circled back to the topic. I finally got through about it though, it's far overwhelming my hearing aids and something needs to be done.

I've never dealt with white noise at all, let alone a direct path into my ears. What should I expect with this?",2025-05-30 02:04:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kysnc3/tinnitus_and_hearing_aid_white_noise/

1kxuxwh,hardofhearing,Has anyone here gotten atresiaplasty (ear canal creation surgery)?,"Hey everyone,
I was born with right-sided aural atresia and microtia — I don’t have an ear canal on that side, and my outer ear is underdeveloped. I recently had a CT scan and was told I’m a potential candidate for atresiaplasty (the surgery to create a new ear canal and eardrum). I’m also considering a bone conduction device like the Osia, but I’m really curious about the experiences of others who’ve had the canal surgery.

If you’ve had atresiaplasty, I’d love to know:

	•	What was the surgery and recovery like?

	•	How was your hearing afterward?

	•	Did you deal with any complications (like infections or canal narrowing)?

	•	Do you feel like it was worth it long term?

	•	If you had the option to do it again, would you?


I’d really appreciate any honest input, especially from people who had it done as teens or adults. Just trying to get as much perspective as I can before making a big decision.

Thanks so much!!

I was born without ear drums and ear canals in both ears and have had 14 surgeries to reconstruct them. My first few surgeries were just trying to stabilize a newly created ear canal because my body kept rejecting it and scarring it over. Then were my surgeries to implant donor ear drums. All the rest of them were just trying to get more hearing so I could live a somewhat normal life. I was so young when I had the major surgeries (my first one was when I was 2 1/2) but I remember being told I was in the operating room for a long time each time. I’m sure technology has changed A LOT (it’s been about 35 ish years?) so I bet it’s easier and maybe even less invasive?

Maybe someone else in the forum might be able to help, but feel free to find an ENT and ask them these questions. Even an audiologist might be able to help you. I had an ENT saying I should look into BAHA surgery and my audiologist said they never should have told me that because my hearing loss is too profound and BAHAs haven’t caught up to the technology of hearing aids in terms of power, so both sound like good resources to ask. 

The little I do remember from surgery (my last one was almost 20 years ago) you have to take a significant time off of work (depending on your occupation). You can’t get your ear wet for like 8-10 weeks, you can’t sneeze, and you can’t lift anything for weeks. My surgeries left me with major scars behind my ears, but I’ve also had a LOT of them, so I expect that won’t be your case. I’d also ask how many surgeries you would need to do what they are proposing. I imagine you need a certain amount of time to heal in between, so I would assume it’s going to take a few years? You also mentioned your outer ear is underdeveloped, so you may need surgery for that as well as the atresiaplasty. Not to be morbid, but you may also go to an ENT and they tell you you actually don’t qualify for the surgery, for whatever reason. I’m not sure that is common, but I’m sure it happens.

I’d also ask which route is more sustainable. I had an ENT tell me I’m a candidate for BAHA surgery and an audiologist looked at my hearing tests and said absolutely not. I did all this research into BAHA only to be told what was an option really wasn’t one. Not that I really wanted the BAHA, but being told there is another avenue got my hopes up and that wasn’t fair to me.

Good luck!!

1kxh7zk,hardofhearing,Hearing aids in humid places,"Those of you who live in humid places, do you just have constant ear infections? I've always lived in very arid climates, but moved to a humid location a few months ago and my ears are constantly damp, itchy, and irritated. Is there any solution?

[댓글]
No. I live near the ocean, so it's humid year round for me. 

As a kid I always had ear infections and swimmers ear bc I was a kid of ""all waking hours"" and water was in my ears after my bath but not being able to dry before hearing aids went back in. 

Are you allowing your ears to dry before putting the hearing aids in? You can also invest in a hearing aid dryer machine (your audiologist will know about them/ sell them) to help with the humidity. There's also a little air squishy thing that's meant to blow air thru your earmolds tubing to remove any water buildup/ humidity. You know, when you get that water bubble in your tube that makes everything sound weird? 

Don't keep the hearing aids in the bathroom while you shower/ get ready. 

I don't know the exact mix and you'd need to verify with your doctor, but there's a mix you can use with an ear dropper to help dry out your ears to prevent swimmers ear. I think it's hydrogen peroxide and water or rubbing alcohol or something like that. I've never done it. I stopped having infections and swimmers ear as a preteen when I was able to control my showers and routines. As an adult, every once in a while I'll get swimmers ear, but it's not too common.

I cannot recall of I ever had ear infections. I know that one of my siblings suffered a lot of swimmers ear.

  When it comes to hearing aid care. The best kind is to get a hearing aid dehumidifier. I have lux dehumidifier. Which I got off from Amazon.  I love it. And I also clean it by getting the ear wax out of the ear molds.

I'm not sure if you're talking about in or out of the ears. But when it gets stupid humid, the charging case that my phonaks came with have a little pod inside the lid for a giant silica gel pack. 

This works well, as here in Ohio in the summer, it's sticky and... funky behind my ears pretty quick.   
At night, a quick wipe dry, weekly rubdown with some alcohol pads, change out those wax filters monthly and don't cheap out on the domes and all seems fine. 

As far as inside the ear, I'm the reason they say you aren't supposed to use the Qtips inside the ear. The sound of a qtip against the eardrum is rattling to say the least, but I've always been this way and after a conversation EVERY single time with my audio/ear people, they relent that I'm not doing any more damage as long as I'm careful and not more aggressive than I already am.   
Note: DO NOT USE QTIPS INSIDE THE EAR. 

Though, come on... that's what they're made for.",2025-05-28 13:33:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kxh7zk/hearing_aids_in_humid_places/

I call it “pretending to be human”. Reading other people’s reactions and responding physically in a way that seems appropriate but also dissuades people from following up with me directly. Listening and responding with physical cues but looking away when they make eye contact. It’s exhausting.

They don’t help her very much, they seem to make anything digital worse, for ex: talking on the phone, listening to a TV, or listening to music feel nearly impossible at times. I hate to see her live her life like this and wanted to reach out on some hearing loss threads to see if anyone has had better luck with another type of hearing aid or any suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated! Even if you have a suggestion for a better group to post in, I’ll take that too as I am new to this kind of research but desperately want to help her.

She does have caption call but struggles to use it. I did download I think the caption all app on her phone but she struggles with that as well (she doesn’t do well with new technology) as she doesn’t know how to use her iPhone very well and prefers the cordless landline. 

I heard something about AirPods helping and acting as hearing aids which I don’t have my hopes up high about for her as I image they’re for a lower grade hearing loss? Maybe they will help strictly for the digital stuff as it connects directly? 

Anything is greatly appreciated, TIA!

If you have a Costco near you they have very reasonably priced hearing aids. But you may want to bite the bullet and bring her to an audiologist.

your local center for independent living may have some ideas, reach out to them!

edit: try your local office on aging (may have a slightly different name) too!

You can have her try a ClearCast device. Easier to use than many hearing aids.

If you could sit down with her and help explain the caption call, I’m sure she would love that. You could also write instructions for her and leave them by the device. She is older, so maybe she just has a little trouble with memory recall and written words will help better?

Hearing aids don't always help us connect - I hear everything, and it's loud, but people all sound like Donald or Daisy Duck. This is not unusual, there are lots of threads on Reddit that talk about this.

But your grandma can still connect - she should use captions while watching TV. (I hope she reads fast enough). For the telephone, she can get a **free** telephone with a captions screen; see [Captel Captioned Phones](http://www.captel.com). If she has a cell phone, she can use [Live Transcribe](http://livetranscribe.app) for conversations, and [Innocaption](https://www.innocaption.com/) for cell phone calls.

Those apps may be easier than others for her to use. The Captel phone is designed for older people with a large screen and custom sized lettering, big buttons and simple interface.

If she's intimidated with technology, just be patient and show her how to use it again, and again, and use all your patience. She's not stupid, just reluctant and intimidated. But hopefully, you'll be able to show her it's all worth it.

She's very lucky to have a grandson like you - I'd like one! You're getting a perspective here from someone near her age - I'm 87.",2025-05-27 17:15:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kwsxkj/how_can_i_help_my_grandma_better_hearing_aid/
1kwmi17,hardofhearing,Questions,"Hi guys, I'm posting this because recently I noticed that at work I can no longer hear the crickets from my left ear from certain distances and I'm not sure if it's always been there and I'm just noticing it now, in  2022 I had an audiogram done and it said I had mild hearing loss in my left ear but not enough for me to benefit from hearing aids according to the doctor. 

I also suffer from tinnitus in both ears, my left ear is worse and have been dealing with eustachian tube dysfunction issues as well, primarily in my left ear I usually wake up not being able to pop my left ear in the morning as of recent, and to top it off I have mild TMJ issues, I'm sharing the results of my 2022 audiogram to see if you guys think that these results would make it more difficult for me to hear crickets from certain distances as well as high frequencies from machinery like an air conditioner.

About 7 or 8 days ago I was prescribed antibiotics because my ear was hurting and went to the doctor and said that my left ear was red since then it feels like my left ear can hear some higher frequencies again coming from the property ac which produces high frequencies sounds, however the crickets don't get picked up unless I get a bit closer, otherwise they're extremely faint.

I guess I'm very worried that I may have done additional hearing  damage to my ear but it's very hard to tell when you have eustachian tube dysfunction issues. So my question is by my 2022 audiogram would you guys say that it should be more difficult for me to hear these sounds mentioned from distances going by my audiogram?

Last but not least can you guys share with me which companies are actively researching hearing regeneration do you think we'll have something in 10 years?

[댓글]
That audiogram is definitely consistent with not being able to hear crickets as well - it shows mild high frequency hearing loss in the left ear. 

I'd also agree with the assessment that you wouldn't see a ton of benefit from hearing aids, that's an extremely minor loss on just one side. Hearing aids don't give you perfectly normal hearing, they alter sound to make it easier to understand speech for those who struggle with it.

If it feels like it's gone down, I would definitely recommend getting another audiogram done.

When I first started focusing on hearing tests and learning how much hearing loss I had…I was in my early 40s. 

I had tinnitus for years before that. I didn’t know what it would do to my hearing over time. 

I would caution you about downplaying the results. If the audiologist suggests hearing aids then please consider it. Hearing loss is correlated with cognitive decline. It also affects your safety. Hearing aids can help the tinnitus issue.

My hearing declined enough at that time they didn’t recommend me for surgical intervention. They said I wouldn’t have 100% improvement and would continue to lose hearing with age.",2025-05-27 12:53:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kwmi17/questions/

She then refused the surgery on the right side to preserve what little hearing she had left. She wears an extremely strong hearing aid to have partial hearing on one side.

I recently convinced her to talk to doctors again and see if techniques have advanced or if there are new options for her. They immediately are pushing her to get a Cochlear Implant on the 100% deaf left side after a hearing test showed some hearing in the cochlear but none in the ear. They are setting up a surgical consult for two weeks out.

I know that I pushed her to look into treatment, but this feels very rushed and I wanted to ask this community if there are other things that should be reviewed? Is there anything that we could be missing? Having hearing again on that side would be amazing but we also don't know the quality of hearing from a Cochlear Implant or what to expect from it.

Any education or advice is appreciated.

r/cochlearimplants exists and you can ask there. You can also just tell the docs “no thank you”. Take some time and think about it.

I just had cochlear implant surgery 5 days ago on my left side, genetic hearing loss as well. Go to r/cochlearimplants and you’ll find a lot of info there. The surgery can take a toll on her, and depending on how long its been since she heard something on that side can be a factor. To put things simply on quality: thats unpredictable, you don’t know until it’s activated if it sounds like a robot or a 2000’s ipod.

Don’t rush the decision. I haven’t had mine activated yet but here are some things I noticed/understood:

Auditory hallucinations are a thing, think of it like phantom pain when you get something amputated, but with sound. It’s creepy and hilarious at the same time.

Your balance may be off for a while, i personally think mine is because of the cochlear deformity i have (Incomplete partition type 2). If your gf has the same deformity then PLEASE get a CT scan, it can give doctors a heads up on how to do the surgery. 

It’ll be 2-3 weeks post surgery until you can get the cochlear activated.

For 24 hrs after surgery (in my case), no hearing aid on either side due to bandages, no glasses either (same reason).

The surgical site will likely itch and have a lot of pressure, not much you can do about it. 

Also- look into all 3 brands, not just Cochlear. I personally went with Advanced bionics bc it’s better with MRI’s and has colorful options, and partners with Phonak for bi-modal.

I don't know much about CI but you definitely need to research ALL of it. Not just the upsides. 

Many CI users end up hating it.

Some have serious migraines. 

Some can't get over how different CI sound is vs how hearing aids sound. Neither sound like ""normal"" hearing

There is a possibility that the surgery will eliminate any residual sound left. She most likely won't be able to go back to a hearing aid if she hates it. 

There are some medical things to be aware of. No heavy contact sports like soccer.

If you ever need an MRI you can have it done but not like everyone else (I don't know much about it) 

Check out adventuresindeafed on Instagram for more details. She's a deaf person who has CI who grew up with hearing aids and is a deaf education teacher. 

Does your girlfriend know any ASL? she'll be spending about 2 weeks with no sound before they activate the CI, not to mention if she hates it, there's no going back to hearing aids. 

It'll be a whole learning curve to decipher sound again into understanding sound. 

And of course there's always the possibility that it'll be absolutely fine and she'll love it and wish she did it sooner. But just research it ALL before taking the leap. There's no rush.

Were prosthetic bones discussed as an option at all? Do you know what bone(s) was damaged?

Can they recover any hearing on her left side? As in another surgery to fix it? If not, as far as I know the only way to help that is CI. 

A surgery consult may seem fast, but it doesn’t mean she is committing to surgery. This would give her more answers about the procedure and what to expect. If you can, I would go with her so she doesn’t feel pressured into scheduling a surgery date. She deserves time to think about her options or even see another doc or two. 

They usually push the surgery because they are under the assumption that you want it fixed. Make sure they know you are only going to find out information to make an informed decision, which you have not settled on yet. If they pressure you, ask why it is so important to be done so soon, and if you see or hear any red flags, leave. You have no contract or obligation to do the surgery. You are allowed to say no.

I’m slightly worried about her going to the same doc who took away her hearing in her left ear. I’m not saying he was at fault, but it wouldn’t inspire a lot of confidence in me. Maybe he informed her or her family that it was a possibility, but I know if it was me, that thought would always be lurking in the back of my mind. 

You did not rush her into treatment. You helped her start her journey to gather information, even if it leads nowhere. Knowledge is power. She deserves to know if there is a better option out there for her, but she also reserves the right to not do anything about it. I think you did the right thing. You care and you want her to have the best life possible, however that looks. She was scared and you gave her a little push, but helped hold her hand so she didn’t have to face it alone. You did everything I would want a SO to do.

I am a hearing aids user. 

Just note that when getting cis. They can't promise you what you will actually hear post everything

They have to destroy hearing in order to preserve hearing. 

Now if your gf qualifies and wants to go with it that is her freedom to choose.  

You should not push your agenda onto her choice.",2025-05-25 03:59:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kutm1r/help_with_surgical_options/
1kt5k3j,hardofhearing,"i alr posted this on an r/deaf reddit, but i'm doing it again here. please help i need advice","little background context-- I'm a teenager and I suffered an extreme TBI (Traumatic brain injury) back in November and was diagnosed with a concussion. since then, i've had two more head injuries (i play a lot of sports, sue me). after that initial TBI, i started to lose my hearing rather quickly. within the span of two weeks, my hearing went from just below normal to moderate/severe hearing loss. Even weirder thing was that it was flat hearing loss (on first audiogram). anyways, it kept progressing. my dad got me hearing aids, (BTE), which helped a lot, but its only progressed. I've had tinnitus since I was a young kid, and it also got worse. The audiologist did a whole battery of testing, which included normal tympanometry, and a just below normal ABR (right ear was slightly slower, and happened to be the worse ear). My cochlea was also fine. My biggest struggle is not only with the hearing loss, but the sudden inability to understand speech as well, *especially* in a crowded place. As a polygot, this is really bad for me. I am constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves, and to do so slower -- and it's humiliating. i'm also very musical and its ruining the piano for me. doctors (and i) originally thought APD (CAPD), auditory processing disorder, because of the inability to understand speech and differentiate sounds, but when we tried to get in on studies they wouldn't accept me because of the additional hearing loss. Then I heard about FND, and I'm in the midst of doing my own research because my doc gave up on me. both my parents are docs and they're trying their best as well. please help I don't know what to do. I learned ASL as a precaution,  and so did my fam, and its really helpful in crowds/restaraunts, but i can't live like this. at least not without answers/a fix. if anyone also has hearing loss related FND from TBI please please let me know. i'm desperate.

I don’t have any answers for you, just empathy and encouragement. It’s frustrating to have to ask people to repeat themselves. But you deserve the chance to hear and participate in conversation. Crowded places are frustrating. And, sadly, a lot of places are not designed with those of us who are HoH or d/Deaf in mind. 

I hope you remain persistent and find some answers.

You have a lot of technical things going on that are beyond my experience.  
But I can say for sure that you'll get past it, move forward and move on. Being embarrassed about not being able to hear others in noisy environments or asking for someone to repeat themselves is like being embarrassed about going to the bathroom. It's a part of your body's functions, like your hearing (or difficulties) and while your journey is still in motion, until answers are found, it's just what it is.

Also: your doctor 'gave up on you' is not a doctor you want to be seeing. I'm assuming you have a swarm of ENT/Oto/audiology/neurology and so on available to you, having a frank discussion about your plateaued journey and disappointment with the methods in use should spur them into action.  
DO NOT LET THEM GIVE UP UNTIL YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THEIR METHODS.

Hello, I don’t have much to add but the virtual support. Why exactly were you not accepted for music studies? This feels wrong.

I didn’t get hearing loss or anything from TBI but I had several severe ear infections when I was pretty young and lost both hearing in ears, my right is also worse for some reason — I had the issue with having to ask people “what” or “huh” a ton it kind of because I was deaf as hell, it kind of became one of my jokes throughout high school and I’d always respond with “sorry I’m deaf as fuck what did you say” and just make a joke out of it 

     I just graduated last year so I was dealing with having large crowds and shit for a while and it was overwhelming 100% I know the feeling one thing that helped me was being able to read lips to kind of fill in gaps and stuff cause I don’t hear everything perfectly with my hearing aids, I eventually would kind of get used to it, I went from 8 year old hearing aids to a new up to date with tech pair and I was hearing way too much at once and it kind of hurt my head to focus but I got used to it after a week or 2 

         My hearing when I first got it diagnosed though dropped a bit from when I got hearing loss (diagnosed) to when I actually got hearing aids and slightly after that then it leveled out and plateaued out",2025-05-22 23:47:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kt5k3j/i_alr_posted_this_on_an_rdeaf_reddit_but_im_doing/

(trying to give the OP link torpedoed my own ha!)

I had some serious imposter syndrome about mine. I mean 20+years of 'huh' and learning all the context clues was good enough right? No it was way way worse than I thought.

Nope.

I took my mom with me to pick them up. She's been on my ears journey since I was a 10 year old child and then, as a 39 year old man (me not my mom) she bawled her eyes out when I wore them for sitting and tuning.

I had zero idea that a/c made noise. 5,000 dollars for the most expensive headphones I ever bought. It seemed so ludicrous, I was doing fine... Well... Clearly I wasn't.

I missed a stoplight, on the way home with these things rammed in my ear canals... My car was too loud, everything was tinny, the radio had to be turned off. Mom was in her car  in front of me and called me. I was just sitting there, LISTENING to a leaf scrape across the cross walk in front of me, gobsmacked. No clue, none, I thought they were too dry, all this time, to make noise cause I'd never heard that sound.

By the time we traveled the few miles from the audiologist, I was like, drunk. Overstimulated, so much noise. I needed a beer. So we stopped for lunch. Fans in beer coolers, sports ball on so many TVs, I had a full conversation with a guy that would NEVER have been able to hear (defaulted to smile and nod even though I could hear him, habits.) Mom caught me.

Water bubbles and burbles when it's boiling.

\*Hearing aids on\* birds. \*Hearing aids off\* no birds. \*On, off, on, off\* text everyone in my family if there's always been birds in the big tree outside my apartment and get inundated with tearful and emphatic 'you didn't know?' from them... I pretended so well.

To those of you that maintain that hearing aids are NOT  normal hearing, but my hearing isn't normal on its best day. This is glorious. There's so much noise, so much stuff to hear, so much daydreaming and listening to do. I'm not a hopeless dreamer, not in the slightest, but sometimes, when it's too much... you know what? I have a quiet place with me, all the time, just a power button away, be immediately jealous normies. I carry my zen spot with me, and so do many others.

Retain your ability to stand in childlike wonder at the noise that you've always been missing, at the stuff you didn't know was happening around you, at the words that your mind filled in out of context. Hearing aids are awesome.

Edit: Gosh, it rambles, would anyone prefer I fix it? Cause I had to hasty retype the last half from memory after accidentally deleting it.

I’m a hearing aid user too, I will never forget wearing them for the first time. But I have to admit, finding the Deaf community was an even more powerful moment for me! Hearing aids help me hack it in the hearing world, but discovering the Deaf world was like finding home. I’m a huge believer in HH children getting all the options! Now that I have access to both worlds, it’s a privilege to have two cultures, two communities, and two voices

All of this is to say, I’m so glad you are liking your new hearing aids! And also want to assure you that you are a valid part of the community. I also have imposter syndrome from growing up using LSL, but our experiences of deafness are valid!

Walking in to church after being fitted … heard rustling leaves for the first time in decades. I had forgotten. A spiritual experience!

I'm an audiologist and I'm so glad you love your hearing aids! I am totally jealous that I don't have an expensive pair of custom earphones and the ability to shut off noise around me at the touch of a button 😁 

My favorite comment after putting hearing aids on a first time user. They had to use the bathroom, then they came back into my office: ""I could hear myself pee!"" Yes sir/ma'am, you sure can 😊

I think I'm looking forward to getting mine now. Thank you.

Well said.  I feel the same.

I'm mid 30s, had my hearing aid a month though I've been on this journey since I was 4! 🙃

I only have hearing loss in one ear, so I was aware of a lot of these little sounds, but being able to hear them more clearly was so weird. The world is so much noisier than I realised. Tbh sometimes it's a little overwhelming and it's a nice moment when I get home from work and take my hearing aid out and have some quiet 😂


For me, the big moment was when I went to a restaurant and I heard every part of the conversation happening at my table without having to ask people to repeat or just pretending I heard and trying to figure out what they said through context. Yes it's tinny, but man it's so nice to be able to properly join in conversations.

I remember feeling like hearing aids wouldn't really make much of a difference. It would be nice to hear more conversations with people, to not have to ask people to repeat as often. But the amazement I felt when I put them on and remembered that bugs existed and they made noises at dusk was indescribable. Leaves rustling, birds singing, the world was full of wonderful little sounds I had just forgotten all about. I could hear my child whisper to me, hear him laugh from across the house, hear him sing. As someone who was late deaf, I have loved finding a little community in the deaf community, but I could not live there all the time. Sound is just too close to my heart.

Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.

I tried hearing aids a few years ago, I was so over simulated with a lot of background noise like vehicles on the road, fans, wind etc. It made everything worse because I couldn't have normal conversation as I couldn't concentrate on hearing speech from other people. In the end I couldn't use hearing aids

Thanks for the post. It really helps. I'm too needing hearing aids, but man, it's hard to think I need them like I can get by without them. I wear contacts, so this just makes me go crazy thinking I need another device to live a normal life. Again, thanks for sharing.

ahh, I remember the first time I had my hearing aides in, in the audiologist office, I guess there was a tree with birds outside the window, and they made noises. I jumped out of my freaking skin and cussed, thought ""what the f*ck was that noise?????!! where the f*ck did it come from?!?!?!?!?!"". 

so many things made noises, that I have no idea made noises. like paper! paper makes noise! it can crinkle and even just like as it warps or something in the air, and when it touches onto the desks. and writing utensils can make noises too. 

I never actually got used to it, but I have sensory processing disorder, (auditory included) and get extremely overwhelmed and overstimulated. I was never able to get my brain to adjust to it. so I wear them so I can turn them on in an emergency, but i basically always have them off. sometimes I just carry them instead but leave them out.

My daughter, 11, after getting her hearing aids finally, we were walking up to the front door of her school, and she said, Mom!  I man hear myself walk!?   I didn't know just made noise when I walked!     Amazing.  I'm so happy she's getting the help finally.",2025-05-22 21:12:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kt25ia/to_those_struggling_accepting_hearing_loss/
1ksp9vu,hardofhearing,Struggling to accept hearing aids,"I knew for a while that something was wrong with my hearing. I don't understand my housemates half the time and need subtitles to enjoy movies or TV. But I had almost convinced myself that I was just flaking out and not listening well enough. 

I saw an audiologist this week just to prove to myself that nothing is wrong. It turns out that I was wrong. I actually do have some hearing loss, enough that the audiologist recommend hearing aids. 

In that moment I said and did all the right things. I listened to her description of the hearing aids she recommended and asked a couple of questions. The order was placed. 

But now I'm struggling to accept the fact that I actually need them. ""I can hear just fine,"" I tell myself... and two minutes later I'm guessing what someone says to me or turning on the subtitles again. 

Y'all, this is really hard for me. I had convinced myself that my symptoms were an ADHD thing, that it was my brain that missed words. Nope. I physically am not hearing things.

Now the hearing aids are in at the audiologist's office and a huge part of me wants to leave them there! 

Thanks for listening. I just needed to talk all that out.

It's always hard when you have big changes that challenge your life's status quo. I hope you will find peace with wearing hearing aids and that you will find some improvement once you adjust to them. Wishing you the best!

Put your pride aside and make your life easier. Not hearing everything, asking for repititions, people getting mad because you didn't understand them the first time, etc etc. The best thing you can do for yourself is try them out. 

And you need to give them a fair shake. It took me about a month and a half to get used to the feeling of wearing mine. Now, after two years of having them, I wouldn't consider going back.

What you're feeling is totally normal. It will take some time to adjust. 

That said, hearing aids *rule*. They're like the fanciest headphones on the planet, you can stream music and phone calls to them, turn them off on the plane when a baby won't stop crying, you're basically a cyborg. I absolutely love my hearing aids, they're a part of me.

What you are feeling is normal! It’s a big change. But keep in mind that it will help you maintain a better quality of life to hear better.

I could of wrote this myself, but along with that I found out from a hearing test when I was 6 that my father infact knew its genetic and he opted not to deal with it!! I thought I was crazy for years thinking I couldn’t hear :(

Totally normal to feel that way. There is a grieving process that happens whenever we are diagnosed with something that is life-changing. You may feel denial, anger, confusion. But, eventually it will come to acceptance. I think once you get your hearing aids and you realize how much you can hear, you’ll come around to them. Just give it time. Personally I love my hearing aids and I was so excited to get them and finally hear what I was missing!

I mean... do you want to hear, or not? 

When you put em in and pick up on everything you've been missing you'll be glad you did.

I was born HOH, so getting hearing aids was wonderful for me! It will take time for you to adjust. We have your back here. Don’t leave them @ audiologists office. In time you’ll come to LOVE them! Accept &amp; learn to love your deafness!

Make sure the audiologist turns on the “acclimation” feature if it’s on your hearing aids. This will gradually turn up the volume available on your aids. My aids had a two week adjustment period for this feature.

:( i have a friend having this issue too, what he found helped somewhat was to think of it like custom designer airpods since they’re bluetooth.

I could have written this 10 years ago, noe that I'm used to wearing mine I hate going without them. Not because I can't but because it's so much harder than it has to be. 
I still miss stuff, just not as much. These days I'm trying to make myself be brave enough to start using additional support like a Roger microphone.

It took me using a pair of cheap hearing assistance things to see how much I actually needed hearing aids. It was definitely humbling. It only took a short time with my hearing aids to see that they were going to help me have a better quality of life. 

That was 15 years ago, when I was in my early 40s. Now, I couldn’t do my job without them. I’ve learned to see them as being as needed as my eyeglasses, and if I’m not ashamed of or resistant to using glasses, why be that way about my ears?

They will take time to get used to, and you might find it takes some time for your resistance to go away. It’s definitely normal. But give them a fair try and I’m betting you’ll see them as a helpful thing.

I composed a response to your post. It got so long that I'm turning it into its own post and I don't know how to link your post directly in it... I'll try, because you were the inspiration.

I’m so sorry. I hope you get used to them and they make your life easier.

It's a normal part of the process. You're losing something, some form of body functioning, a necessary part of your bodies functioning. It's normal that there is some anxiety, some struggle with that.

All I want to say is this: Losing your hearing is more than just hearing less. It's having a hard time understanding, having a hard time socialising and taking a lot of your energy. Lot of people who lose hearing and keep putting off getting aids have problems with memory. Because your brain is stimulated less and less, you can have some Alzheimer like symptoms, which don't fully go away when you get your aids (it's a cascade reaction). Be smart about using them, before you lose a part of yourself you can't get back. 

Also this: talk to people about it. About the grief that comes with the hearing loss, with having to rely on some technology. Talk to them about the fact that you cannot hear the same again (give yourself time to adjust to the hearing aids, because they might sound different than you're used to). Go back to your audiologist when they don't work the way YOU need them to work. They should help you, make them help you.

And after all that: look for the bright side (because there can be!). I can have some music on through my hearing aids, it's fun! I can put off the hearing aids when I want some silence, it's a perk like that! And also: have a little fun with yourself: you won't hear everything right now and again. I've lived with being HoH my whole life, and what I hear and what is said can be so different, it is honestly funny. Laugh! 

You're going to be fine. Give yourself some time to grieve and adjust, you will adjust to this.

This was kind of me 2 months ago before I got my hearing aid. I also have ADHD and definitely some audio processing issues. 

I've known I've had hearing loss since I was a child but doctors never offered me anything and I think I always assumed there wasn't anything they could do. Plus I think I had some internalised ableism about wearing hearing aids. I think when you grow up ND, you really take on hiding disability, so the idea of having something that made me look visibly disabled felt very anxiety inducing.  

I've worn mine for a month now though and first: the type of hearing aid I have are very discrete. No one even noticed I was wearing one. And it has really helped. It doesn't entirely mitigate the issues I have with communication because I do still have processing issues, but it has at least taken away that first barrier so conversations are much less exhausting.

I totally understand, I went through the same thing 13 years ago.
It took me a while to regularly wear my hearing aids as they do take a while to get used to.
But it's worth the effort, I wouldn't be without mine now &amp; if I can't wear them for whatever reason I feel very vulnerable.
Oh &amp; I have ADHD too, so believe me it really was the best thing I did, getting my hearing aids 🦻

I’ve had hearing aids since I was 3 and without them I can hear somewhat, mine are the ones that just fit right into your ear no tube on the outside - I’m moderate to severe hearing loss, but I had them for so long and no one really said a thing to me about them if I didn’t say anything and if people did they would just be like “oh that’s cool can you turn them off when you don’t want to listen to people” “can you sleep better” and mine are Bluetooth so I can listen to music whenever I want (was amazing in high school and in college now) etc 😂 honestly don’t know if I could live the way I do without these things they are awesome, $9000 portable headphones though 👌

This post basically describes what I'm going through. I had gone to an audiologist seeking advice but just started to panic and left. It's hard to cope with how much damage I've done listening to loud music, but keep telling myself I don't need them.

I’ve been wearing hearing aids for over 40 years. My approach and when I discuss it with others, is just really to let them know that some people wear glasses. Some people wear hearing aids and some people were both.

Hi, this is a bit late but I’m a cochlear implant user and I totally understand how you feel.

How long did it take you guys also had ear tubes to have your ears return back to normal sound and pressure?

[댓글]
I’ve had 13 tubes and also have Eustachian tube dysfunction. Up until number 13 the impact was instant post procedure - crystal clear hearing and ability to equalise. Number 13 has been a disaster with post op bleeding from the middle ear and loads of balance issues. Number 11 through 13 have been sub-annular rather than through the ear drum (it can’t take any more perforations).

Oh man going way way back to my youth when I did this twice anually till I was 17. 

Give it a couple weeks. 

You have holes in your eardrums as of today and they're pretty angry about it. This I think also changes the way your eardrum moves, so there'll be some differences.   
IF your eustachian tubes are non functional, how did you get this far in life without like 800 ear infections? Lucky dog... That's the root cause (they think) of all my hearing stuff.

So, I have tubrs that I've had for 4 years or so, and I have to get them replaced when they fall out. I have permanent dysfunction, with my tubes near completely closed. When I could hear, before I got a nasty infection needing IV therapy. It took about a week. Try the Vasulva maneuver.

[댓글]
I know this app well, it's amazing with a proper over the ear headphones. Get something good like Sony xm4 and above and it will work great. You also need to turn off all equalizer and anc. 

The problem is as you can see on the below right, you skipped the calibration.


With proper calibration (for most of the good headphones, it's automatic) it's almost as good as a professional audiogram.

I would suggest seeing an audiologist.  But if you won't/ can't, I would say to at least use the same headphones otherwise you're comparing apples and bananas.

Mobile apps are not a replacement for a trained audiologist exam.

For the love of god, go to a trained specialist for objective, professional and proper medical advisement. This is your health we’re talking about hear.

What is this app? I'd love to compare it to my most recent audiogram.

I'm sure you would have noticed if your hearing went from almost deaf to mild loss. However, if you're concerned about your hearing, I would just go see a specialist. 

I don't know if apps are any good, but I can imagine it's not going to be as good as professional tests.

Different headphones definitely vary a lot in frequency response. The professional headphones are probably properly calibrated to the specific software they're using",2025-05-21 19:43:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ks73fm/hearing_seems_to_be_improving/
1ks3c20,hardofhearing,Hearing Aid Financial Assistance,"Hello everyone,

I recently earned my Doctor of Pharmacy degree and will be starting my residency program very soon. Unfortunately, due to my own carelessness, my dog chewed up my left hearing aid. I’m now left with only the right one, which is making it very difficult to function, especially as I prepare to start work in a clinical setting where clear communication is essential for patient safety.

I’ve looked into financial assistance options in both my home state and the state where I attended pharmacy school (where I currently live), but I’m either ineligible or facing long wait times, sometimes 3 to 6 months. I’m also still considered a dependent and currently have very little income, making it impossible for me to afford a replacement out of pocket. And for those wondering my insurance deductible is $5,000 making it virtually impossible to get coverage as I’m not anywhere close. 

I would really appreciate any guidance or resources, nonprofits, grants, hearing aid, or other avenues that could help me obtain a new hearing aid quickly. Any advice would mean a lot to me.

Thank you so much in advance.

Check with your local Vocational Rehab and see if you qualify for assistance

Depending on the brand and model of aid you need, you can try purchasing a new one through an online hearing aid retailer such as: 

- https://onlinehearing.com/
- https://www.wholesalehearingdirect.com/
- https://fithearing.com/product-category/discount-hearing-aids/
- https://www.ziphearing.com/

Or, I have also heard that Costco has very reasonable prices.

Have you checked with vocational rehab in your state? My state pays for hearing aids and college but need to ask.

First I would check to see if there is any free replacement program availible, the last pair I bought had free replacement for like 5 years as long as you had the device, no matter the condition. If not for new ones, it can depend on a number of factors including where you live you and household income but you may be eligible for financial assistance from the hospital you get your hearing aids from, this could be in the form of writing off the debt or giving you a payment plan on it. Even if household income is high, explain your situation and they still might help. Personally I would get the new hearing aids and then deal with the bill when it comes. Often hospitals are more willing to work with people after they owe them money...

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this right before residency starts. My FIL has moderate hearing loss and wears over-the-counter hearing aids (he's been using Audien Ion Pro) and has had a good experience with them. They're much more budget-friendly and might help hold you over while you sort out a more permanent solution.

My audiologist office accepts donations from patients. Have you checked with your audiologist to see if they have anything to bridge the gap?

one avenue that might provide a quick, temporary solution, or at least help you function while you pursue long-term financial assistance, could be exploring some of the newer (OTC) hearing aids. They aren't prescription devices, but some models like [this one](https://rewarduplevel.com/aff_c?offer_id=1904&amp;aff_id=129838)are specifically designed for mild to moderate hearing loss and can be purchased much faster and often for under a few hundred dollars. They might not be the permanent, high-end solution you'll eventually need, but they could bridge the gap.

I would look into vocational rehabilitation.

Also, note for the future- get your hearing aids insured. I worked for a property and casualty insurance company and a coworker was gobsmacked that I didn’t insure mine. She said this is incredibly common. Just add it to your home insurance or renters insurance.

1kr9ohp,hardofhearing,Apple Watch detects 85-90db purely due to people talking. Is that dangerous?,"Hey guys so I thought it was clubs or bars with loud music where hearing levels can be damaging but recently looking at my Apple Watch see that even tons of people chatting at once can go over 85-90db. I'm now worried as after club exposure and getting tinnitus I now protect my hearing but haven't in crowded settings either. I don't have any hearing loss according to a professional hearing test back in August thankfully but I just want to make sure I know I'm being careful in the future.

Yeah, but only if you spend more than 40 hours a week according to Apple health

My hearing loss starts at that range and gets worse. What’s funny, I didn’t realize it until it got worse that I’ll never get it back to the levels it was before. 

So don’t do more unknown damage to yourself only to find out later. Not worth it.

I’ve noticed if I have my hand near my face when talking(like resting my head in my hand while leaning on a table) I’ll always get alerted if I talk enough. Does that mean that me talking at a normal volume is going to damage my hearing? 

Most likely not. 

There’s a lot of factors that play into how loud sound is. Normal talking isn’t going to hurt you. If you’re worried about loud environments I’ve heard a ton of people like products like Loops.

I once had mine go off from a Starbucks Drive through intercom. I was in a mood, was annoyed by the alert, turned it off. 

As others have said, its a sustained exposure that really leads to hearing loss. However, far as I know, there's no time frame setting on the alert, just db level, so you have to use your own judgment on how long you want to be in that environment.",2025-05-20 16:45:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kr9ohp/apple_watch_detects_8590db_purely_due_to_people/
1kr2rkb,hardofhearing,Dealing with On-Call Stuff,"Hi everyone,

I'm hard of hearing with a moderate to severe hearing loss. I ended up in the computer security (i.e. cyber) industry, and it turns out that a lot of it is IT with some additional security layer-ons. I've been told in my interviews that I need to get some more administrative experience in order to really be good in this field.

It turns out that being an administrator is basically being the parent of a baby: i.e. when something goes wrong, you must attend to them. Larger enterprises have people available through rotational shift-on-call schedules, but sometimes there might be an expectation or a need for me in a job to be on-call at night.

I've been looking at some technological solutions and options, but I'm afraid that even with the strongest measures taken, they might not be enough/suitable to wake me up in the middle of the night when something is going on. Have you all ever navigated something like this, and if so, what did you do to successfully get through such a life obstacle?

[댓글]
You can get a flashing light system, or bed shaking system to wake you up. In Canada the Hearing society sells adaptive technology to help

If you’re not a super-deep sleeper, a smartwatch or wearing your phone on one of those exercise arm band thingies, I did it for several years and the vibration was enough to wake me to some level of awareness. 

I also leaned heavily on outsourcing. You don’t need someone as qualified as you working that second/third shift and weekends, you just need someone who can follow a simple set of rules to determine “is this something I need to wake up u/SnooOnions3761 about” (and if so, keep calling/texting me till my old ass wakes up)

I make on-call expensive and undesirable for any company. Unless I’m getting paid a 24/7 salary (spoiler: nope) I make a compelling case that NOT outsourcing is untenable.

I sleep with my phone under me so I can feel it vibrate. I also have a watch linked as well and am also a heavy sleeper. Configuring alerts inside the alerting platform to hit me on the app, then SMS, then email al within 2-3 minutes. (Work paid for watch)

You mentioned you were a deep sleeper, but how responsive are you to lights?
I am a deep sleeper in regards to noise, but lights I often wake up easily to.
While I am not on call, I use an automation via smart light bulbs to turn on when a certain alarm on my phone turns on.
Shortcuts or IFTTT may be a great method to play around with. I’m not skilled enough to make it pair with a vibration of any sort, but I wish I could! I wonder if there are any that do connect via Bluetooth and if there would be a way to play with those settings?

I’m not a particularly deep sleeper but I’m concerned I’d sleep through the smoke alarm if I’m home alone. Fire Service (Scotland) coming out to visit next week to assess. If you’re such a deep sleeper, how will the smoke alarm waken you?",2025-05-20 11:43:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kr2rkb/dealing_with_oncall_stuff/
1kqns1v,hardofhearing,Looking for Bone conduction hearing aid (after failed stapedectomy),"My story:

  
Had a firework go off next to my ear. Saw a local ENT who performed a tympanoplasty, but while in there, saw the stapies was blown to bits. Woke up from surgery, had 2 months of insane 9/10 vertigo that rendered life terrible. 3 months later had stapedectomy, had 1 week of hearing, but scar tissue slowly built up, and hearing went away. Then had another (or maybe it was just a ""revision"", with similar results). That was 10 years ago. I gave up trying because the emotional uncertainty was too hard. Some odd side effects, if i touch my tongue to the roof of my mouth, its makes my eardrum tickle. I also have constant tinnitus. Maybe once every year, I have a multi day bough of vertigo, but luckily it usually clears up. 

Fast forward 15 years, I have a 3 year old son, and I think I would like some solution to provide hearing, as my inner ear still works (if I put my teeth on the guitar body I can hear it quite well) and bone conduction hearing aids could be a solution. In fact I even had the sound-bite device for a while, before it broke and they had gone out of business.   
  
Anyone have an experience either Pronto or BAHA? Or any others I should consider? Any complications with the process of putting a bolt in your skull? Any new developments? Its been so long since I have seen an ENT, not sure where to start. Thanks for any info you can provide. 

[댓글]
Also, I have no current hearing in the damaged ear. I work in a woodworking shop and dont always wear ear protection becuase i thought the ear is already damaged, Maybe I should start

I had a BAHA for about 6 years. I upgraded once to the 6 max hoping it would be better. Nope. The implant site is still sometimes sore and gets crusty if I accidentally brush my hair the wrong way. My bike helmet makes my sunglasses rub on the area and irritates the abutment site. I didn’t feel I got much out of it. I just had ossicular reconstruction with tympanoplasty with a very skilled surgeon. I drove an hour and a half to have a surgeon who knew what he was doing. My surgery ended up complicated. My eardrum had grown onto my stapes and to the chorda nerve. My incus was gone. I have no taste or feeling in 2/3 of my tongue but hopefully it will recover. This is the surgery I should have had 6 years ago but my Kaiser doctor said it wouldn’t work and to do the BAHA   Ends up she didn’t know how and I should have gotten a second opinion. My hearing is a little bit better and might improve even more in the next couple months. My clicking and fluttering in that ear has gone away. If all goes well I will be removing my BAHA Do your research and get second and third opinion

The BAHA implant is in my skull and the abutment is screwed into the implant. The skin surrounding the abutment some what attaches to it. However it can easily pull away or just get irritated. So it is like a scab forms when it gets bothered. My son kept recommending that I get it removed because he said it is basically a wound that is always there trying to heal. My son is a neurosurgeon. Two years after I got the BAHA I was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease in my other ear , just bad luck. That diagnosis motivated me to seek out help for saving some hearing. Wearing hats and helmets is tricky.

I'm about to get a stapedectomy. Hopefully it goes well, but, on the off chance it doesn't, my doctor has already told me she recommends a cochlear implant. 


I had a BAHA for years. The external part attached to my head via a magnet. It worked okay. Sound conducted better with stronger magnets, but the extra pressure gave me very bad headaches, so I eventually stopped wearing it. The doctor who's performing my stapedectomy removed the implant last year.

I have conductive hearing loss, tried the stapedectomy, but during surgery my Dr found an artery (persistent stapedial artery) in my middle ear, he closed up and couldn't do the stapes surgery, so I understand your frustration and emotional uncertainty.

I saw another doctor after and recommended a baha implant, we went with the Oticon Ponto 5 implant, there's a ton of videos and information online about it, but here are my two cents: it works well and unless I hit the sound processor by accident it doesn't fall off. I have dropped the sound processor a few times and it hasn't broke or gotten damaged. It is a solid option for me, sounds like for you it would be too.

Some drawbacks are, while the abutment heals you do need to keep the (minimal) wound clean, and after, you need to clean it once a week (very easy to do). Of course I can't hear anything with my right ear when I don't have it on, which is very irritating so you have to keep batteries available wherever you go (depending on usage, batteries can last anywhere between 5 and 7 days).

On the positives... I can hear!!, I can listen to music, answer all my phone calls and listen to anything on my phone through bluetooth, BUT BETTER YET I CAN'T HEAR MY HUSBAND SNORING WHEN WE'RE SLEEPING (let's just call it selective hearing) :D

That said, I would do anything to get my hearing back, but unfortunately my weird Persistent stapedial artery makes surgery complicated for me.

Though I'm sorry about your hearing loss, I hope this is helpful. Feel free to dm me if you have any questions.",2025-05-19 21:28:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1kqns1v/looking_for_bone_conduction_hearing_aid_after/
1kqebh1,hardofhearing,Losing Confidence Because of My Hearing,"I'm 33 years old and from Japan. I have some trouble with my ears, and this is my first time posting on Reddit.

It was last year when I first felt discomfort in my right ear, so I went to a clinic to get my hearing checked. The doctor told me that while I didn’t need any urgent treatment, my hearing wasn’t very good compared to others my age. I had never experienced tinnitus before the diagnosis, but it started around that time.

Since then, I’ve been constantly worried about my ears.

Now I’m dealing with tinnitus and trouble hearing clearly. But every doctor I’ve seen says there’s no problem. Still, I constantly hear the ringing, and sounds don’t seem clear to me.

The doctor acknowledged that I have some high-frequency hearing loss, but they said it shouldn’t affect my ability to hear in daily life.
So I’m confused — if that’s the case, why am I having trouble hearing clearly? What’s really going on, and who’s right?

[댓글]
Your hearing is considered in normal range (barely) your issue is tinnitus 

Protect your hearing as much as possible to prevent your tinnitus and 8khz hearing from getting worse

You have a mild loss just on the edge of ""totally normal"" thresholds. You will notice some difficulty with high frequency sounds, but things like bird songs and rustling leaves... It's not yet really affecting human speech, though perhaps you'd notice it a bit in noisy environments.

See your third cross and circle? Mines a sharp ski slope down from there (I don't mean that like it's a competition lol, just sharing to help frame it) and so my loss goes from mild to moderate to severe to profound. I also have severe tinnitus all the time.

I've heard but not verified that under stress, tension, anxiety; hearing is the first thing to 'go'. Meaning, that when you're all tense cause you didn't hear something, you're making it worse for yourself. You're gonna miss some things, and that tinnitus isn't helping.

Take a deep breath, focus yourself. You'll find you have an amazing ability to fill in with context, and don't be above asking someone to repeat themselves. In the meantime, at night, or in quiet time, white noise machine or just some background drivel on your phone will help the tinnitus from creeping into the forefront of your brain.

You COULD ask for (I can't tell if the Dr did one on your audiogram) a speech in noise (SIN) test, that might lend to sensorineural hearing loss, which might explain some things. Did they really only do one masked test at the 1000 Hz? 

Strictly off the gram, speech \*shouldn't\* be a problem for you, a typical Japanese Female speaks at 220-260 hz and you're theoretically normal at that range. Tinnitus, perhaps some further digging is needed, for now work on your calm.

1kq8clj,hardofhearing,Affordable hearing aids?,"Are there any hearing aids under $200 that help with mild to moderate hearing loss?

[댓글]
Anything under $200 isn't a hearing aid, it's just a sound amplifier.

That said, your best bet at that price point is probably Apple Airpods, they have an amplification feature I know some have found value in.

Next step up would be Over-the-Counter hearing aids, then Costco brand above that.

I have mild hearing loss with tinnitus and I'm using Audien Atom Pro 2. It's only $189 if you buy from the official site and use their voucher. Obviously not a miracle device but it's simple and reliable. For the price, it's hard to beat.

I’m been using ELEHEAR hearing aids for over a month and they are great. $411, easy instructions and good streaming and iPhone connection. 45 day try out comes with them.

your not going to find anything your.headphones can't do at that price point. hearing aids are fucking expensive, especially the good ones, look to see if there's any financial aid programs for hearing aids and see what can help

Costco is the best price/service I have ever found.  Check your Province (Can) or state , they ma have financial support.  In Ontario Canada you get $500.00 …which almost covers all of your hearing aid at Costco.

Closest option might be Apple AirPods with your audiogram programmed to them and if you are within approved regions. What country are you in? There are programs available and options for affording hearing aids. If you are in the US and are working or a student, some states will pay for hearing aids through their vocational rehab office. My state offers hearing aids and college tuition for deaf/hard of hearing residents that want to work or pursue higher education. Vocational rehab does not offer services for anyone under 18 in my state.

My partner uses OTC hearing aids from audien. He started with the atom pro 2 (under $200) and later upgraded to the ion pro (about $600) mainly for the bluetooth feature. Both worked well for him and he's been happy with the sound quality. If you're watching your budget, the atom pro 2 is a good entry point. But if you can spend a bit more, the ion pro is worth considering.

I've been using the Nova hearing aid from Heardirectclub for my moderate hearing loss. It's about 259$, a bit above your budget, but it is worth the price. There's a noticeable difference when you have them on, voices sound much clearer. You can even get a feel for the improvement through the audio simulation on their website.

1kq87c6,hardofhearing,"Just found this, wondering if there are any other profound SSD people.","I was born without the cochlear nerve in my right ear. Since my hearing is 80/20 asymmetrical, it's technically only a 20% loss despite a whole ear being dead weight. The inner ear is functional if slightly deformed, but the sound input cannot reach my brain. Since the issue is a nerve deficiency, I'm unable to get a cochlear implant, and I'm left with no way to localize sound. I can hear what people are saying fine unless it's loud, so I usually go unassisted. I've tried cros and bone conduction implants, but what I've found most helpful are AirPod Pros of all things due to their conversation boost mode.

Honestly, the most annoying part is the inability to tell where sound is coming from. My hearing is literally mono. People, even family, will yell to get my attention and I have to look for visual cues. I bump into people often because I don't know that they're coming up behind me. 

I always have this feeling people don't believe me because I converse unassisted and it sucks. Assistance doesn't help the core issue for me, which with current technology is unfixable. It's only helpful in certain contexts, so I'm left in this weird space where I appear conventionally hearing, but the issues are real and they're just... not curable for me.

I'm curious if there are any other profound SSD people here. I feel like I'm in a weird place when it comes to deafness sometimes, lol.

[댓글]
Yea it sucks.  I'm ssd for 1.5y now from covid.  Still adjusting.  I mostly just stay on the edge of social gatherings now.  Have to be very strategic in where I position myself.  I got a disability tattoo on my deaf ear. 

  
Do you experience tinnitus?

Hey! I've been profoundly deaf on my left side my whole life. Lost the nerve to meningitis, so I'm completely mono as well. I found it extremely isolating because I'm not hearing enough to function like abled people, but not deaf enough to be part of the community.

The way people don't believe I'm disabled is crazy. The struggle to have conversations in public settings or in groups larger than 3 is so real.

I also tried cros hearing aids, but they were super uncomfortable and just made sound overwhelming.

You say you've tried bone anchored hearing aids? I've been wanting to get something like the BAHA for so long. Are they worth it, do you think?

Huh 

TIL I wouldn't be able to get a cochlear implant even if I wanted to since my hearing loss is very similar to yours.

I lost all hearing (no nerve response at all) in my left ear several months ago due to Labyrinthitis, but the hearing in my right ear is near-perfect. I also have moderate tinnitus (whooshing mostly) in my deaf ear, which is really distracting (and can contribute to auditory fatigue by the end of the day). I've been putting off the hearing aid discussion/decision while I dealt w/ other issues, but now it's time. I work mostly solo in a quiet setting, and my meetings are nearly all virtual, so I don't typically need any assistance there. Restaurants and larger in-person meetings are difficult, though, and I attend (and present at) conferences at least once/year, which is very challenging now. I'm also frustrated about my inability to identify or localize sounds unless I have visual of the cause or event (i.e., Was that a cat throwing up in the other room? A tree branch scraping a window? Something falling inside a closet?) I've looked into all the options (traditional HAs, BAHA, CROS, Cochlear Implant); any advise or insight re: best outcomes for those high-ambient-noise environments?
