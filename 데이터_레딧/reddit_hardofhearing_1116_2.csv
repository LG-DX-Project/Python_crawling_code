1oy15nu,hardofhearing,Anyone else get extra bothered by loud noises?,"I became HOH around 2-3 months ago and one of the things I noticed is that loud sounds irritate me a lot more. I hate loud music, loud clattering, anything loud. Went to the club for Halloween and regretted it heavily lol. Ironically, when my parents speak loud to me to get me to hear it irritates me heavily... I find myself using the noise suppression on my hearing aids quite often.

Anyone else relate to this? Why could this be?

yeeeup. i’ve been losing my hearing steadily ever since I spent years in marching band, shit was way too loud for my teenybopper ears. 😭 I have to wear earplugs at work when I do dishes because the plates clattering feel like scissors in my ear canals.

Lost my hearing when I was 3 and I’m now 35. A club has always sucked. I can read lips but it’s *so annoying* to hear nothing over the music.

i think with noise induced hearing loss its entirely possible your injury can cause pain with loud sounds, and thsoe with hearing loss lose the sound buffers we have. all of the hairs in my cochlea that both booths quiet sounds and dampen the louder ones are gone. my acoustic reflexes are also gone, which is what protects a healthy ear from loud sounds

I definitely am. I'm reasonably certain it's because I'm autistic. I wore hearing aids age 12-18, and when no one could make me wear them anymore, I stopped. I just picked up my new ones yesterday (age 31) and remembered immediately why I stopped. Even with the upper volume threshold lowered (the hearing aid techs can do this btw!) I was overstimulated to the point of a full meltdown within four hours. 

The thing I kept thinking the whole time was ""damn, why does *everything* need to make sound? Why can't some things just be silent?"" Frankly, if it wasn't for the benefits to communication and brain health, I wouldn't have gotten new hearing aids at all. My hearing loss is a blessing in the face of my auditory avoidance.",2025-11-15 19:52:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oy15nu/anyone_else_get_extra_bothered_by_loud_noises/
1oxx86o,hardofhearing,Ear Distortion Got Better but Not Gone What Could This Be?,"I’m 15 and last week I suddenly started getting this weird *robotic/buzzy distortion* in my **left ear** whenever I heard sounds. It lasted about 2–3 days and then mostly went away, but my hearing still isn’t completely normal.

Here’s what’s still happening:

* Sounds in my left ear still feel **slightly low-pitched**, especially noticeable in things like my OnePlus Buds Pro boot-up sound
* Occasionally the robotic distortion comes back for a some time
* I have a mild cold, and now I also notice a very faint **“fluid moving” sound** in my **right ear**, but only when I really focus
* My right ear otherwise seems fine
* No injury, nothing loud happened that day, it was a normal day
* I use earbuds regularly but never had this issue before

Last week’s robotic sound scared me a bit, even though it went away. I’m just wondering if this is something like fluid/pressure from my cold and if it can fix itself, or if I should see a doctor/ENT. =

Has anyone had something similar? Should I be concerned that some symptoms are still hanging around?

Yes generally if  you’re having a health issue you should see a health care provider. That being said  if you have a cold it may be worth waiting for that to subside and then assessing if you need to see a dr. Having a cold impacts the ears nose and throat so it’s possible that’s the issue",2025-11-15 17:16:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxx86o/ear_distortion_got_better_but_not_gone_what_could/
1oxv2eg,hardofhearing,Companion app,"Mine keeps disconnecting - I thought it was when my aids needed new batteries, which fixed it once before, but then they disconnected again last night, replaced batteries...still won't connect! Oticon not my audiologists know what's up - anyone had this experience?

Forget your HAs from your bluetooth settings and set them up again as a new set. That usually fixes it.

Also, make sure you're not paired to too many things. I had issues when paired to my computer, ipad, iphone, etc. and had to turn off bluetooth on one of them to get it to connect to my phone.",2025-11-15 15:51:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxv2eg/companion_app/
