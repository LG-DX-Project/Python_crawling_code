1oxpef8,hardofhearing,Sad 😭,"I'm síck of feeling so wórthless. Sometimes, I don't know what to do with my own life, I'm just simply existing. It feels like everything in my life is falling apart and I'm just right here watching it being ruíned. I'm already tired of telling myself that everything will be alright, I'm slowly losing hope in everything. I am like a withéred flower who never know how to lift herself up. I'm just trying to live until I find no reason to carry on anymore.

It's hard to pretend that I am a strong person when I know deep in my heart that I'm slowly giving up on myself too. The pressure of life is trying to weigh me down and I feel like I can do nothing about it. I feel like I'm becoming more worthless each day and it's making me feel so small. Sometimes, I wish I was more valuable as a person. I wish I was good enough and strong.

1oxj2qv,hardofhearing,Did getting hearing aids change how social you are?,"Before I got my hearing aids, I didn’t realize how much I avoided having conversations.
I’d smile, nod, and hope I was responding at the right time but inside I was always
anxious I’d misheard something. Over time, I stopped joining group chats or going to
noisy places because it just felt exhausting trying to keep up.

After getting my hearing aids, I was able to follow along without guessing. This has
honestly changed how social I am, I feel more confident speaking up or even just
hanging out without worrying I’ll miss half the conversation.

Hearing aides don't work for me, but with learning ASL and visiting Deaf spaces I've had a similar experience. I'm enjoying the company of other people for the first time and having a blast!

Hearing aids do more to improve my quality of life than any other health remedy or appliance! No clueless smiling-and-nodding. No failure to engage go fear of misunderstanding or social faux pas. Renewed satisfaction in being a real-time interactive part of family gatherings and intimate moments.

Yes. HAs helped me reenter life!

Pretty much everything! Conversations that would get skipped due to fear of non-hearing started happening, brought a lot of extroversion too.

No, not really I think. Although I’m much more responsive instead of saying “what?” or “huh?” all the time or not even responding at all

No. That's never happened. Hearing aids *always* pick up unwanted background noise.

Every family gathering last year had me basically saying nothing and not really interacting a lot, because of all the extra noise making it virtually impossible for me to actually meaningfully participate in the social aspect of these events.

Anytime I'm anywhere and someone wants to socialize with me, it never seems to be quiet enough. A refrigerator can be too distracting. I go to the bar, the store, the coffee shop, or the bank (of all places) and some idiot just *has* to have the radio on.

If anything, even after 30 years of wearing hearing aids (I'm 37), I long for the quiet solitude of just being able to watch Netflix (which has CC) or YouTube (usually with a Bluetooth headset).

Yes and no. Yes in one on one settings. But I still can’t socialise the way I did aged 16 - 50 in the local pub with my mates. They also amplify background noise.",2025-11-15 05:04:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oxj2qv/did_getting_hearing_aids_change_how_social_you_are/

1ox6g3s,hardofhearing,Low self esteem? Low confidence? Does this make me unlikable?,"Basically the title.

I’ve struggled with this for most of my life, for some background info, I’m a woman and almost 40 and have a hearing loss. I am well educated and hold a job and own my own home. 

I find it hard to make friends that take me seriously or don’t seem to comprehend that I have understanding of human depth and conversations. I am socially awkward due to my hearing loss and have missed a lot on social cues growing up. I have some friends and good ones but the ones I am unsure about, they seem to be surface level friends- not meeting me halfway or understanding me or making an effort. (Don’t get me wrong, with my hearing devices I hear perfectly clear and communicate just fine) but they seem more surface level and just meh. I feel like sometimes I’m a filler friend like an option if no one else is around. Are these people just fake acquaintances? I have a hard time reading social cues as well.

I am currently in therapy figuring out my shit- working on being healthier and making healthier choices and learning my own self worth. But it only seems to solve my problems as it is on my own, but hasn’t seemed to improve my social life. Does anyone have any tips to just let this go and focus on oneself?

Sorry if this all sounds like a midlife crisis- but I’m so tired. 😪

If anyone has any motivating advice or inspiration, please send them my way. 🤟🏼

I'm 57. I've been wearing aids since I was 23. For the longest time I had only hearing friends, which is good. Some understand better than others, that's for sure. When my hearing dropped the last time, two hearing friends didn't fully understand my new communication issues and I had to let it all go and that was hard. I don't know if you have any local hearing loss support groups but that's helped me in the end. They validate my experiences. 

I've been talking about confidence and self-esteem the last week or so on other social media. If you're on LinkedIn, my posts is open to anyone (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chelle-wyatt-a410b7233/). It is hard to have confidence with hearing loss, doubting whether or not we heard right or not. Plus people have so many misconceptions about hearing loss. That's the part I'm always correcting.

Hi. 

You took a page from my diary, typed it and called it your own! 🤭🙃🥰🫣 

You are far from alone. 

(I write this while sitting in my car after hiking, watching the sun set. Alone. )

If you’d like to talk/txt/be pen pals, please reach out. I’ve found that the more I talk with those who have walked the path similar to mine, the more we understand each other. I went through my entire life thinking I was broken; I didn’t know anyone else like me. I was living in a very small town, my parents had the best intentions but they kept me isolated (severely) and I never got the chance to go out into the real world until I was in my 30’s. It was…SHOCKING. 

It still is. 

I’m now 44. I have went from hearing aides to a Cochlear Implant, which was the best thing I have ever done in my life. I have been a Cochlear mentor for about 3 years; I went from being the person who viewed my hearing loss as my deepest darkest secret. I hid it at all costs; it was the shame that undid me. Now? I’m proud of my path. I’m one of the, if not the biggest advocates for @CochlearAmerica 
I tell everyone the truth about life with hearing loss, deadness, and how it affects not only you but everyone else around you. Hearing loss is a one way street, fast track to early onset of dementia. Cochlear gave me a chance to learn how to live AGAIN. This time? I hear so much that I have never heard before. 
Fortunately/Unfortunately. 
Ha! 

Please, reach out. 
You are not alone.

1ox2x78,hardofhearing,How often do you end up charging your hearing aids during,"I’ve been thinking about upgrading soon, but I’m curious how people handle charging routines. I know most newer models are rechargeable now, but do they realistically last a full day with normal use, especially if you stream music or take calls through Bluetooth? Please let me know how your experience has been with rechargeable hearing aids.

[댓글]
battery life for mine (phonak) is the whole day, 9am-10pm give or take and i only charge them when i’m sleeping. on the plus side, if you forget to charge them overnight i find that charging them just for 20-30 minutes gets me through 5-6 hours. I’m constantly listening to music through them, and find it doesn’t affect the battery life. my last hearing aids (first of rechargeable/bluetooth model) lasted me a little more than 4 years until battery was basically gone

Yes, they absolutely last a full day. I've had mine for two years and they last for 14-16hrs even with heavy (like, 8-10 hours) of streaming. 

I've only had them die before I could put them in their charging case maybe... three or four times over the past two years? It's been great. 

But yeah... without streaming, I imagine they'd probably last two full days. They're absolutely not like iphones.

I work 12 hours shifts for work. I use batteries now but back when I had rechargeable I’d throw them in at 5am, and by 7-8pm they would be dying. So for me, did not last a full day. As a guy in his 30’s doing shift work I did not like the rechargeables and switched back to battery.

I've had Resound Quattros for at least 6 years now. I only recharge them at night. They're usually still at 75% battery when I put them on the charger.


I do maybe an hour total of streaming/calls each day.

Most HAs now will last for 30-50ish hours. I wear my Phonak sphere 90s from about 7am to midnight every day and they're usually at 60-70% battery still when I go to charge them. I stream a ton and use the sphere mode a ton. 

I had Oticon More 1s before those and I would typically get about 1.5 days of use out of them before needing to charge. It's a non-issue these days.

Only one time in three years have I ever had a low battery warning from my hearing aids. I must have been streaming very heavily that day.

Mine are 3 years old and still holding a full day charge. I *did* completely forget that I would need to charge them while we were flying overnight from the US to Iceland, so after landing, I had to charge them in the terminal while we waited for our shuttle.

I charge my Jabras every night

Mine can last several days without a charge. I try to charge it every other day if not every day

My last hearing aids were Kirkland brand and they were the first generation of rechargeable. The battery sucked. I have long days (6-11) and they would start to die between 3-6 pm depending on how much Bluetooth I used (usually a lot). 

My new hearing aids are ReSound. The battery is amazing. I can stream all day and they have tons of power left at night. Also the charging dock holds battery so if you can't plug into an outlet you can just set them in the case and they'll recharge quickly. However, their water resistance sucks (I had to get them fixed by the manufacturer after only 3 months due to a sweaty workout) and I've had a lot of issues with the Bluetooth. My next set will be Phonak and I'm never getting anything other than that.

Oticon Intent. On workdays I take them out of the charger at around 7 am, listen to music and podcasts, make calls all day. At 10 pm they are still at around 30 % charge. 

Age is about 1 year.

My Widex Moments last a full day, unless it's a heavy Bluetooth usage day.  I put them in the charger when I go to sleep around 10-ish and take them out of the charger when I wake up at 5....

I had to upgrade to a stronger hearing aid so now have battery powered but my old was a rechargeable phonak and lasted me one day easily. Sometimes two days since I never used the music or calls (couldn’t hear them clearly enough).

I have oticon HAs and wear them an average of 3/4 hours a day (I have sensory problems, and wearing them for a long time is too much). I usually only charge them once a week. To be fair, I do have a charging case and I just put them back in there each time instead of putting them in the regular case, so they're always at 100% each use, and the case holds about 3 full charges. They definitely last longer than my battery HAs did.

I've got Phonak rechargeables for a mild to profound bilateral loss, put them in around 7-8 am and they last me until 9/10 pm. use them for Bluetooth pretty consistently throughout the day (laptop, phone calls, music, etc). but I normally take them out by 4pm cuz I'm done hearing lol

Mine, Oticon Intent 4, last about 20 hours.

I charge mine at night and the charge lasts for the whole day. Every once in a while they disconnect from charging and I have to charge them. Rare tho",2025-11-14 17:32:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ox2x78/how_often_do_you_end_up_charging_your_hearing/

1ow97e7,hardofhearing,Hearing parent with HOH child,"Hello all!

I am a mom of a newly diagnosed child (2F) with moderate hearing loss. She has a genetic condition called Marshalls Syndrome, that causes progressive hearing loss. We are working on getting hearing aids ordered and have seen all the medical professionals  (Audiology, ENT, etc).

We are already plugged in with TEIS (TN early intervention) and have seen a Social worker. My husband and I both work full time and She goes to daycare full time. 

  
Mainly I am posting because I have no idea what I am doing.  No one in my or my husbands family have gone through this process and we feel so alone. People in our circle are supportive, but they just don't understand as most of our friends don't even have kids, let alone one with a disability. 

  
Any insight would be helpful. Also, any recommendation for support groups or assistance would be appreciated as well. We are just lost and need guidance. &lt;3

[댓글]
Connecting with early intervention is a good thing. Encourage ASL and spoken english equally. Check out r/podc.

*hugs* 

You could see if there is an active hands &amp; voices program near you. 

Gallaudet has extension offices, not sure if there is one in TN, but if there is contact them. Shared Saturday Reading is an amazing experience. 

StartASL has ASL1 for free online.

I know it would be a big trip and investment if it were a good fit for your child, but our experience doing cochlear implants at Boston Children's was outstanding. We hesitated going through with it, and now that it's done we wish we had done it much earlier. 

I also recommend looking up wrights Law and getting their books. They are THE go to lawyers and advocates for special education. If they ever do an in person training near you I highly recommend it.

I'm HoH myself (100% deaf in left ear, severe-profound in right ear).

Depending on where you are, there may regularly held social events for Deaf/HoH people. Those can go a very long way to not only help you and your husband, but especially your daughter so she sees others just like her. It's likely to be at a place similar to, say, BW-3's (that's where I used to go to one all the time where I live). It's also a fantastic way to learn sign language and getting help because all of you will be totally immersed in that environment. It might be overwhelming at first, but I promise everyone there will be so eager to help!

HOH child here! Definitely do both English and sign language. Join deaf communities. You are not alone in this. There’s a lot more of us out there than you think and a lot of support!

Two of my sister's kids have genetic hearing loss so she's a few years ahead of you. 


My suggestions:


1. Reach out to your local nonprofit(s) for Deaf and HoH people and ask them to connect you with resources. Often there are more resources available  than most people are aware of. 
2. Start her learning accessible tech, languages, and devices before she needs them. For my nephew, it was a lot easier for him to adjust  to a hearing assist device in school because he wasn't having to figure it out and try to follow  along in class at the same time. 
3. Read up about  disability protection in your jurisdiction.  IME, as a child who had chronic medical disabilities growing up, if you don't know your/your kid's rights, you/your kid *will* get screwed over by folks who don't  care about  your rights (I could go into detail about my numerous near misses as a kid with brittle asthma, but I'll spare you. Suffice to say I know from experience that if you're not looking out for her, nobody is).

(Hug)

  
As a hearing Mom who raised two HOH kids, I wanted to chime in.  First of all, lots of good resources suggested. Just be proactive in your area and keep asking questions to get plugged in to what's available.

  
The path we took involved having our kids aided during all waking hours (except showers and swimming pools). I know it's hard when they're little, just do your best. My kids had hearing aids fitted when they were infants. Our goal was to have it feel weird to them when they aren't wearing the hearing aids since that is so crucial to development. 

  
And then talk, talk, talk. When I ran out of material I turned to books. We read books everywhere. On the floor, in the tub, in the car, on the sofa, in bed. The books became friends, but were really a gateway to language. Language acquisition came differently for my hoh kids than my hearing kids. They didn't absorb it like sponges. They needed more explanation, more interaction. 

  
It takes a lot of intention. But it does not have to be limiting. My two kids now: lawyer and medical laboratory scientist in their mid-20's.

Hi! I'm also the hearing parent of a HOH child. I recommend getting connected with the Deaf community, such as through a school for the deaf. Sign up for a Deaf mentor if you can. I have found it so valuable to learn from DHH adults since my child (16 months) cannot yet tell me about his experience. Connecting with other families of DHH kids can also be helpful, though to be honest, I've had some mixed experiences with other hearing parents having ableist views about our kids. But we do still attend playgroups and events for DHH kids because it's important to me that my kids see and get to know other DHH kids. I don't want my son to feel like he's the only one.

I also recommend learning ASL! Real time in person or virtual classes are ideal, but I know that can be challenging as the parent of young children. I have mostly been using the app Lingvano alongside the ASL at Home curriculum (https://www.aslathome.org/) and this book by Cecilia Grugan: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/714348/learn-to-sign-with-your-baby-by-cecilia-s-grugan-illustrated-by-brittany-castle/. ASL at Home is free to families with DHH kids. The latter two are both helpful for the kinds of vocabulary you need with young kids that might not come up as soon in ASL classes designed for adults. The site Lifeprint also has good resources, and the Oklahoma School for the Deaf offers free online classes every semester. We've also learned from our Deaf mentor. Learn ASL from Deaf people!

My son was diagnosed at 7 weeks and has had hearing aids for a little over a year now. I know it can feel like a lot to process at first, but truly, it's now just a normal part of our lives. You've got this!

Hi friend, I know things are stressful right now, and it feels like you're in uncharted waters. You've probably never met a Deaf person before. The good news is that this feels like unfamiliar ground but it's not. We've got the maps and now, we can help you find them too. Welcome to the Deaf/HoH community; we're happy you're here. 

Now, into the helpful stuff.

1ovta1y,hardofhearing,People look at me differently when I tell them I’m hard of hearing,"Hi all I’m 34, male. I take care of myself, I’m independent, I’ve built my life from scratch. But every damn time I try to talk to someone new a potential partner, someone I could genuinely connect with the moment I mention that I’m hard of hearing, everything changes.

It’s like a switch flips. The tone shifts, the replies get colder, and not long after… they vanish. I’m not angry about rejection that’s part of life but the reaction stings. It’s as if being hard of hearing suddenly makes me unworthy of basic respect or interest.

I’m not looking for pity or attention. I work, I live alone, I handle my life just fine. I just can’t hear as well as you do. That’s all. But people act like it’s some tragedy. The looks of pity, the “oh that’s sad” comments they drive me insane.

I’m honestly fed up. I’m not broken, I’m not less of a man. I just wish people saw the person first, not the hearing loss.

Anyone else who’s gone through something like this how do you keep your head straight when people keep treating you like you’re damaged goods?

[댓글]
Kinda trying to put a positive spin on this, in that they may be trying to make accommodations for you for when they talk to you?

For years ive said im hard of hearing which people dont really understand the implications, but now say partially deaf, which has better impact. Most people who know me, know to face me now, but that's taken years to ""teach"" them. Some dont bother and that's showing me the person they are, so I dont bother with them. Since partially deafness/hoh is more common, there is more awareness. 

However, there is one new meet, who will be chatting to others, I say hello and immediately she'll switch into exaggerated mouth movements and gestures. Almost talking to me like im stupid. But I take no offence. That's her ignorance and uneducated. I just smile and internally think im deaf, not stupid, go away and learn.

I’m sorry this happened to you. Those types of people aren’t worth your time. I gave up on dating because of my hearing loss, but have made many great friends who try to accommodate and are considerate of my hearing loss without making it a big deal or treating me as different. I hope you’re able to find people who don’t treat you like you’re damaged goods!

All. The. Time.

I just roll my eyes and ignore them and forget I ever crossed paths with them, honestly. I'm aware for some that's easier said than done, but a way to approach it is this: at the end of the day, does it matter in the grand scheme? Will you be thinking about this on your death bed many years from now?

There'll always be people like that, and there's not a lot we can do about that except control our own interactions with them. You could just walk away if it's bad enough.

As for the dating scene, if you're doing online dating, I find it helps tremendously to lay everything out on your profile. That's what I did and I eventually met my wife. I had nothing to hide or reveal on our first date, she knew up front what she was dealing with. That helps remove the anxiety on your part and, in a way, weeds out the potential mates you wouldn't want to be with anyway. Yeah, you might not get as many responses, but the few you do get? THOSE are the ones you want to be talking to. Especially the ones who contact you first!

Although I am also HoH, this rarely happens to me, people are actually willing to communicate. Also, your attitude towards life is positive enough so reactions people give to your disability hold no value. Sometimes we tend to lack confidence for this reason but then God chose us because we are strong enough to deal with it everyday. About the potential partner, not everyone is willing to communicate and stay for life given the challenges. I would say, look as much, go out and socialize through various activities, you'll definitely find the one.

Hello everyone I'm hearing of hard I'm not deaf .  
I just be alone everydays . It hurting too much I'm very hard to tell the communication.. that why  my friends is ignore me but I don't know yet what happened to me...
I'm hearing lost and my mind lost though 💔💔😭😭

I usually just mention it casually after we’ve been chatting for a while if it’s online. Usually before we plan to meet, and I just say it as a “btw you have speak clearly and directly at me because I have had bad hearing since I was young” type of thing vs hitting them with a medical condition right out the gate. If they are the right type of person they will want to know more as you get to know each other better.

I'm 35! I was in the same boat for a while.

Dating just reaaaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyy sucked as a gay dude. It's all so shallow now.  I ended up just putting everything front and center, and let people filter themselves out the door.

Dating feels so transactional and empty with the swiping - I had to mentally bolster myself, and just told myself that they are doing me a favor! You wouldn't want to be in a deep relationship with any of those people and then they suddenly reveal their shallow side and flake off on you when things are serious or you need them.

Someone who cares about you and is interested, will never be bothered at all, never be bothered by repeating what they say or learning new ways to communicate- And will be excited to be with you!

I just recently married after almost 5 years together!

There are good people out there, don't give up, but don't lower your standards for crappy people.

I went through the same thing. Lost my hearing in my early 30s and dating was a bit rough. I just stopped bringing it up or if people noticed, I just continued on as if everything was normal, because it was. 

If you're running into people that judge you at 34.... fuck em. I can't think of a single functioning adult that is worth their salt who would judge someone for a disability. Just do your thing man, there are plenty of women out there who don't give a shit and just want a nice, stable dude. It's hard enough dating in your 30s, the good ones are going to prioritize people who have their shit together over small physical things. 

I was able to land and marry a hottie as a mid/late 30s HA wearing male and I'm practically deaf, short, and pretty damn nerdy. If I could make it happen, I know for a fact that you can too! 

Biggest lesson I learned way back was that respect isn't earned, it's demanded. Meaning, if you act embarrassed of your hearing or bring it up in a way that opens the door to it, people will treat you like that. Just own it and be yourself. Confidence goes a lot further than you would think. Also, figure out where you can go on dates and hear well, wait a couple dates in for anywhere that might be a challenge.

Yes, this has been a common experience for me too. I put this info up front and center on my dating profile, I managed to phrase it in a positive way. ""It helps if you're interested in learning ASL or know some already as I'm \[deaf identity here\]."" 

The sad truth is many (most) people discriminate. The silver lining to this is being up front with the info saves me time, energy and emotional turmoil. There is no worrying about when to tell them like it's some dark secret. Anyone that connects has passed the initial discrimination filter, a promising sign.
  
I suggest focusing on making friends rather than going straight to a serious relationship. As a friend they get to know you. They see your heart and the (minor) flaws are no longer an instant disqualifier like they are when dating from the get-go. Relationships built on friendship is a great foundation as well.

Yup, I’m 35F and dealt with the same. As if it wasn’t hard enough dating with hearing loss to begin with!

I’m hard of hearing myself, granted only partially but I have a button that wear when I’m at work to tell ppl such. Some folks notice it and they speak up, or I tell them up front that I can’t hear them at first. I’ve even had some try to use sigh language which is kind of them, but I don’t even know much ASL!

I am sorry that you’ve faced such hurtles when it comes to your hearing, but I’d say it could help you figure out who is worth your time in some factors. Wishing you the best either way!

31f here and for me its kind of a joke. Like if you joke around about being deaf people are like, really? No way. And then they think its wild that im so functional even though the beep thresholds are in the 40s and 50s db 🤣😭

There seems to be a vibe that domes from saying you’re “hard of hearing” vs saying “I can’t hear very well” it’s weird but try and see if the people around you treat you differently?

I’m a 38 year old woman and I m literally in the exact same boat. I just feel like people don’t take us seriously or want to make the effort to communicate - even if we just have to ask for repetition. Yes learning ASL is great and that’s a whole community and culture but for us who are in the majority of the hearing world, it gets quite lonely.

1ovgbq2,hardofhearing,Moderate Hearing Loss in One Ear - Seeking Advice for Next Steps,"Last week, after years of off-and-on tinnitus, a Meniere's diagnosis I never learned how to properly manage, and vestibular migraines, I found out I have permanent moderate hearing loss in my right ear.

My speech reception/awareness theshold is 25dB in my right ear, 10dB in my left. My word recognition was marked as 100% at 65dB for my right ear, and at 50dB for my left.

I was wondering if anyone out who has similar experience to this may have any recommendations. My ENT said a hearing aid evaluation is a reasonable next step, but she seemed to imply only some people similar to me find hearing aids preferable. 

My big question for that specifically is: Because my left ear is all good as of now, my main issue is struggling to hear people in loud environments, and differentiating someone/something I'm listening to from noise in general. Would a hearing aid help with this? Would it be worth some potential cons? And even the basics, like what even are the subjective cons for hearing aids? 

I haven't been able to find too much about those with a similar situation to mine, specifically when it comes to hearing aids, so any info would be very helpful.

Thank you so much!

with your WRS scores and very little hearing loss, id say nothing! having a hearing aid for a largely normal ear can do more harm than good. especially because your other ear is like a new born baby! hearing aids just make things louder and make hearing in loud environments harder. with menieres though i would absolutely stay on top of it since it can change!",2025-11-12 20:22:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ovgbq2/moderate_hearing_loss_in_one_ear_seeking_advice/
1ov3n0z,hardofhearing,Is it okay for me to wear a hard of hearing badge?,"Hello people! 
I already posted something similar in the r/disability but I figured I post here too because a, I didn't get many clear answers, b, I didn't know this subreddit existed before I posted in the other. 

So, I'm a fursuiter, and I was wondering if it's okay for me to wear a hard of hearing badge (people mentioned ""impaired hearing"" may be offensive to the hard of hearing community)
I have a - diagnosed - selective hearing disorder and a slightly damped hearing on my one ear. It's already hard for me to converse with people in calm environments sometimes because I just can't hear what they say and need to ask to repeat several times. I'm imagining on conventions and especially in fursuit this would be even worse. 
I don't understand sign language very well. I know some letters and some simple phrases but that's it. There's also no real courses to take to improve this in my area. 

Thank you for your input in advance!

The text here blends in a lot, if you want people to read it I’d suggest more contrast.

Use the tools you have to communicate your needs; it is appropriate for you to make accommodations for yourself. If you search this sub you’ll see that the community is largely in support of people with auditory processing disorder using the label hoh to communicate their access needs to people.

As a Hoh person, I really would like to wear this badge. Yeah, it is okay to wear :D

Most people won't notice or read it unless you point it out.

Of course it's okay, but just a little advice.

Make it large.

I used to wear a small one, but nobody ever noticed it.  Now I have one, large button, large font.  It's pretty up front.

One thing though is my badge tells people what to do.  ""I am hard of hearing.  Please speak clearly.""

I think the best thing about the buttons is that they encourage people to be more patient.

Also....

How do I get one of these lovely buttons with this design?

Makes sense to inform people about it. But the logo looks a bit like some ad, or decoration of some sort, which contradicts it's informative purpose, imo. I'd suggest a clean and neutral badge, with no decoration.

If you’re hard of hearing then yes, perfectly ok.

Absolutely. 
In fact, I think that’s great. It will, hopefully discourage people from being absolutely rude when in certain situations where they assume you have ignored them/and/or other miscommunication that tends to happen with those of us who are HH/deaf/Deaf.

I actually have a t-shirt that says this. I like to wear it when I food shopping,  etc.

Yes. I feel like I need to keep one and whip it out whenever coworkers get sassy with me ""ignoring"" or misunderstanding them.

Where do you buy badges like these, or get them made? Because I feel like this would improve the quality of my life, tremendously

Ive “de-googled” so it couldn’t let me in the form. 

But if these are some of the things you’re looking for: 

My alarm clock is a vibrating alarm clock since I can’t hear an audible one. Yay!

But there are so many other things I need now or will definitely need in the next 5-8 years to be similar: 
- smoke alarm or someone calling in an emergency when I’m asleep that will vibrate like that
- for that matter a vibrating alarm for the security system on my house. It’s gone off 2-3 times accidentally while I was sleeping and didnt wake me. 
- basically vibrating tech that can perform some of the tasks of a hearing service dog.

I'd say real time captioning glasses is something I wish was a reality in the next few years. I could see Meta glasses having this capability but I don't think they will

I've had about 4 different models of shake-awake alarm clocks that store in pillows - all lasted a year or two, because the quality was crap.

If you're looking for budget hearing aids, Costco is a great option. They don't have as much programming flexibility as higher end hearing aids but they're more than enough for a lot of users.

1osmjp8,hardofhearing,Congenital deafness due to Kallmann syndrome,"I have a medical condition called Kallmann syndrome that affects puberty and fertility.

I also have two additional symptoms that are associated with having Kallmann syndrome, congenital anosmia and congenital hearing loss. 

My lack of sense of smell and poor hearing were both noticed in childhood but it took until I was 23 to be correctly diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome. The fact I had poor hearing and no sense of smell as well as not starting puberty should have led to an earlier diagnosis but that is another story. I was incorrectly labelled as a ""late bloomer"" for a long time as a teenager. 

I was once told I had 70% hearing loss in my left ear and 10% in my right ear. Senso-neural hearing loss. I believe the testing is different now. I used to have testing done through the NHS but they basically said it is not getting worse or better so they was not much point in having appointments any more. 

At school I was given a NHS (I live in the UK) hearing aid for my ""bad"" ear using a in ear mould. It worked up to a point but I did not like wearing it much and I ended up losing more than one of them.

As I got older I stopped using an aid for a while but found I had to restart about 10 years ago. The modern aids seem to suit me better and I got told that there was no point having an aid in my ""bad"" ear as no amount of volume would help, so instead I have a modern blue tooth chargeable aid (from Costco) for my good ear which suits me far better. 

I like the fact I can play podcasts from my I Phone through the hearing aid but I still wear headphones since I am so used to them and I do not have to worry about any noise leakage from the hearing aid.

[Per this copy of their non-discrimination policy available to the public in Google Search,](https://www.dignityhealth.org/content/dam/dignity-health/pdfs/Dignity%20Nondiscrimination%20Policy.pdf) you can contact their compliance office to indicate that they need to provide accommodations for you. They can determine what accommodations are reasonable/suitable and then instruct the office accordingly.

*  800-842-4681 (Voice) 
* 800-367-8939 (TTY)

Frankly this is absolutely appalling.

It's a one party state, you can record whatever you want if you're in the conversation. Your doctor's an idiot. This probably violates the ADA and you may want to insist on CART if you can't record (and you can) so you know wtf the doctor is saying. Auxiliary aids are exempt from HIPAA and it's your records being disclosed to you so it wouldn't apply anyway.

I'd e-mail a Hard of Hearing or Deaf or Disability group in the area to find out more.

Livetranscribe doesn't keep a record like the other person said but you're perfectly able to do so.

Not a lawyer not legal advice.

Android Live Transcribe has an option to transcribe without saving records

Is it something that they can arrange on their end?  They should be fine with a transcriber that they control, I would believe.

Ask for CART

That’s a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.

If it were me, I would tell them that you are a person with a disability and require accommodation to have equal access to care. Point out that they are violating the ADA and that they should be more concerned about that than you recording the conversation unless the care team is actively planning in advance to commit medical malpractice. Note that you are consenting to the recording so there’s no risk of you asserting a HIPPA claim. Request that they provide a suitable alternative or consent to you using your transcriber.

1oq2cni,hardofhearing,PE tubes,"Anyone here have PE tubes? (Pressure equalizer) 
I got one put in when I was 12-14 years old, and I’m 26 now. 

I’m HOH with a hearing aid but it’s still there. (HOH from birth trauma and possibly the ear infections) 


I get 1-3 ear infections a year, even after the placement. I can’t clean my ear out because it’s narrow and my ear secretes extra wax, and it affects my daily life now. My ENT says the tube won’t come out on its own, and when I’m not dealing with wax impaction or chronic otitis media.. it works okay? I guess. It was supposed to help with my hearing, but seeing as I’m HOH even with the PE.. I don’t know. 


Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? Talk about? I feel like the tube shouldn’t be in there anymore but now I’m betting it’ll be a bigger issue. Is this just what I have to live with? I wonder if there’s scar tissue or something affecting the whole canal. I’m just lost on what to do, has anyone else experienced this?

I’m sure there’s some implications that would say it would make my hearing loss worse, but seeing as I’m already HOH, it’s not a big deal to me. It’s the constant internal sounds, and the fact that I can’t use my hearing aid when I’m having issues, which causes more stress on me.

Just want to say I totally relate. I don’t really have an answer other than get a second opinion if you can since this current path doesn’t seem to really be working for you. 

I was in your position many moons ago, and because of the constant drainage and/or ear infections my ENT convinced me bone-anchored hearing aids were the better option. And they are if you can’t keep your ears dry. 

So I had the first implant surgery. And apparently my insurance stiffed the surgery center. So they refused to schedule the second one. And that’s how I have one BAHA implant. 

Years later I found a different surgeon who performed a tympanoplasty on one ear, and that’s been great. Got me to the point I could wear regular hearing aids. But the other ear has a microscopic hole that still drains and sometimes bursts so it’s still a chancer. 

*All that to say* you’re right. Permanent tubes and regular hearing aids don’t play well with each other, generally. You need a plan for dry ears or for a different type of hearing aid. If you’re current provider isn’t listening to your needs, get another opinion — assuming that’s an option. 

I hope you find a good solution soon.

I have one PE tube. It was inserted this year after many, many ear infections in my right ear. I am HoH but only really the right ear. 

The persistent infections perforated my ear drum more than once and I go so many infections. I don’t know why. I could constantly hear fluid in there and felt pressure a lot. The tube has really helped all that and I worry about it coming out and going back to life without it. 

Yours could be helping more than you think? Sorry you’re having a tough time. The unknown aspects of hearing loss are hard. A lot of what ifs.

I also work retail, and it's such a pain. I'm lucky enough to have loud colleagues and stable hearing, but still, it's insane the number of customers who mumble their orders; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble it slightly differently; I ask them to repeat themselves; they mumble in another different way; I ask them to speak up, and say it again; and then they yell at you; I usually pull out one of my hearing aids, show it to them, then say I'm hard of hearing, and ask if they could just repeat their order loudly and clearly; they usually do, and look kinda ashamed about yelling at me (which is the least consolation I would ask for). 

If you can get a few colleagues on side, to speak up for you (literally, not as in talk to management, although telling customers that they need to speak up is nice), you'll find it gets much easier. If you are able to take tasks from colleagues and give them the phone, that also tends to go pretty well if you plan how to do that ahead of time. 

But generally, retail is already crappy, but apparently it's more crappy if you can't hear what's going on. Finding the spare time to enjoy it is great though.",2025-11-04 22:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ool929/struggling_with_hearing_loss_working_in_retail/

If your concerns is specifically when you're asleep, I'd recommend getting a bed shaker. I got mine to alert me when the baby is crying, but you can set them up to go off with fire alarms, phone alerts, etc. Here's the brand I use: https://www.sereneinnovations.com/collections/home-alert

I have an IPhone and Apple Watch. Notifications can buzz on my wrist. It’s enough of a buzz to wake me up. Maybe look for an app that can connect to an Apple Watch. Apple Watch also has a fall detection feature. I don’t know how it connects to others, but I imagine it has some kind of alert system. 

Alternatively, look for an app that has different options for notification sounds. Something at a good frequency for you.

She can get a smart watch with fall detection. It will send an alert to your phone. If you have smart house things (like Google home and hue lights) you could program your phone to send those alerts to the lights so they blink. I don't know how to do that, but I know it's possible.

Ask your local fire department about smoke alarms. Many install ones appropriate for hearing loss.

You may want to look into getting an alert system for the deaf or hard of hearing. These systems monitor for common sounds (doorbell, kitchen appliances, fire/smoke alarm, baby cry, pet sounds) and send a notification of the sound to a receiver that alerts the deaf or hard of hearing person of the sound. Many of these alert systems also can be triggered by the push of a button transmitter. If your wife were to push the button, the alert system would notify you via whatever receiver mechanism you’ve selected (light, sound, vibration, or all three). 

[Diglo](https://www.diglo.com) (formerly Harris Communications) is a good source for alert technologies for deaf and hard of hearing consumers. 

[Sonic Alert](https://www.sonicalert.com/home-aware-signaling?page=1) has a [HomeAware system](https://www.diglo.com/sonic-alert-homeaware-ii-signaling-hub;sku=SA-HA360M-II;s=322;p=SA-HA360M-II) that listens for smoke/CO detector alerts/sirens and alerts the homeowner with flashing lights, sound, and/or vibration. 

[Silent Call](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/transmitter) also has [transmitters](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/fire-alarm-transmitter-contact-input) and [receivers](https://silentcall.com/collections/medallion/products/medallion-series-shake-up-receiver-with-vibrator-su5001mc) that can be tied into smoke/CO detectors (as well as phones, weather alerts, doorbells). 

There’s also a [Safe Awake](https://www.hearmore.com/product/safeawake-smoke-alarm-aid-with-bed-shaker?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21019171632&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADD0mp6_Y3kUzBvreN2C6OA7F6PdA&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8fbEk7jMkAMVbjRECB3-KiOMEAQYBSABEgJ71_D_BwE) monitor for smoke/CO detectors.

After researching my options for a few weeks, I just made the decision to get a [bundled alerting system](https://us.bellman.com/collections/alerting-devices) from [Bellman &amp; Symfon](https://us.bellman.com). Although the price point was higher than I would have preferred, I liked that the system is modular, easy-to-use, and has a wide range of plug and play transmitters, receivers, and accessories to choose from. This is my first alert system, and so finding something safe, simple, and scalable was important to me. 

I hope you’ll find something that meets your needs.

[EDIT: In my research I also found the following two First Alert alarm options that have strobe lights: [smoke](https://a.co/d/8nMdhBe) and [smoke/CO](https://a.co/d/28eD6yN). I think both of these would be good options for D/HH homes.]

[Another Edit: I also really like [SquareGlow](https://www.squareglow.com/). They are [deaf-owned](https://www.squareglow.com/pages/about-us) and more budget friendly than most, and their products have a modern look and feel. They have a reasonably priced [SOS button](https://www.squareglow.com/collections/accessories/products/squareglow-sos-button) ([SquareGlow on Diglo](https://www.diglo.com/shop-by-alerting-system/squareglow;d=3;c=33;s=341)). My only hesitation was not knowing how the smoke/CO safety part might work.]

1ombvgx,hardofhearing,partial deaf and ear wax are nightmare for me,"Call this my bad luck or anything, but being a cerumen and partially deaf is a nightmare for me. The earwax makes it more tough to listen to other people. Also, i have been using earphones a lot lately, which i might think are also a reason for the increase in earwax buildup. I have had this earwax tool and it has performed great till now, however i wonder if someone else is facing a situation like me.

I remove my earwax daily and it has now become an after shower routine for me, as throughout the day the earwax eventually builds up and clogs up the ear.

[댓글]
Earwax problems are  a  common for me too cause when I put on my hearing aids my body makes extra earwax to push out the „foreign  body“. So I think a similar things is prolly happening with your earphones. You might want to wear headphones instead just to be safe

I’m in the same boat and have my ears professionally cleaned about once a year. I wear OTEs and AirPods and it’s just the best thing to do - anyone who wears something in the canal daily and produces a lot of wet wax naturally would generally benefit from getting it looked at occasionally and discussing what cadence of cleaning makes sense.

What hearing we have is so precious that I simply don’t risk doing the removal myself.

Would be worth having a specialist look at it and see if anything could be done medically",2025-11-02 08:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ombvgx/partial_deaf_and_ear_wax_are_nightmare_for_me/
1om5w00,hardofhearing,Looking for an app or device that helps with text to speech?,"Hi I’m currently a student. Lectures are hard with my hearing loss. What are your favorite apps that help with transcribing what the person in front of you is saying into text? Im also looking for a device that does something similar. Thanks! 

[댓글]
I’m a big fan of live transcribe for everyday use, although there does seem to be some difference in accuracy between the free and paid for versions. I’ve never really had a problem with it personally and have found paying for the app worth it. 

I also occasionally use the otter app if I know there’s going to be many different speakers. It also summarises the conversation and allows you to save them to look back on.

I use an iPhone so can’t tell you whether these apps work for android use. Hope you find something that works for you.

Android LiveTranscribe is free and pretty accurate. I have the app on my phone but I also have several cheap Samsung tablets that I use exclusively for LiveTranscribe and several of my friends keep a tablet at their houses with LiveTranscribe in case I come over. It’s nice having a dedicated device so I can use my phone for phone things while having a conversation. It doesn’t differentiate between speakers, but you can have it save your conversations for a period of days.

Lots of decent Speech to Text stuff.

Most people like LiveTranscribe on Android. I mostly used that until I wrote my own app.

If you're in the US you have the right to accommodations per the ADA(for now with the way trump is gutting everything). This means you can use/ get/ demand CART which is like closed captions in class. (Yes, even if you have an ASL interpreter) 

If you're talking about just everyday personal interactions, I use live transcribe but it's always a hit or miss. It often misunderstands to the point of where I'll just put it away bc it's nonsense. 

If you have enough hearing for it to be worthwhile, you can invest in a Roger pen; which is a microphone that connects to your hearing aids for people to talk into.

Both Apple and Android have Live Transcribe or Live Captions built in.

Otter.ai is my preferred app for live transcription, it saves the transcript, although you have to pay.

Innocaption is a free call transcribing app that also offers human transcribers, through the FCC.

Grain.com is my actual favorite app for transcription that I use on my video calls, however it's not live. I use the Zoom or Google or Teams captions during the call and then get the Grain transcript afterwards. Best quality I've found.

But you were looking for a text-to-speech app. How would that help? Shouldn’t you want a speech-to-text app?

for real time lecture transcription, google live transcribe is probably the easiest option if you’re using android since it instantly captions what’s being said. if you want to record lectures and later convert them to text, uniconverter does a good job handling that offline so you don’t have to depend on wifi or cloud services. it’s pretty useful for reviewing notes privately afterward.",2025-11-02 02:20:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om5w00/looking_for_an_app_or_device_that_helps_with_text/
1om4j0o,hardofhearing,I’m new here! Any advice? How are the people here?,"I just got diagnosed with Mild Hearing Loss a couple days ago after teachers and my parents started to realized that I was struggling with my hearing.

It’s only mild of course, so it shouldn’t be a big deal, but I’m kinda worried.

I can barely hear my friends in large crowds, and microphones sometimes don’t help as they echo, making the words sound gibberish or muffled to me.

I can’t understand men well since their voices are deeper, which means I have trouble talking to my dad, brother, and friends that are boys, and it kinda makes me sad.

I think it’s affecting my school life too because I tend to not understand what my teachers are saying, but I’m too scared to ask for them to repeat themselves because I don’t want to be accused of not listening.

Right now I’m teaching myself ASL. I used to do it when I was younger before I grew out of it, so I need to reconnect with it.

But anything else? It kinda hurts to not hear everything, and a bit scary too.

Edit: I’m also teaching myself to lip-read, and it’s actually a bit easier than expected, but I still struggling with it.

[댓글]
We’re all frustrated and exhausted and have commiseration as a group. Get proper hearing aids. ASL is good to learn but you need someone to communicate with and that’s a big expectation.

Welcome to the group. Who diagnosed your hearing loss? Did you have a comprehensive hearing test with an audiologist? Did they review your audiogram and explain what it meant in a way you could understand it? Besides diagnosing you with mild loss what did they recommend? If you’re not understanding in multiple situations they should have recommended some type of assistive devices such as hearing aids. If not, why didn’t they? 
Lots of questions that you deserve to have answered. Many of our first lessons in having hearing loss was the importance of advocating for ourselves. We need and deserve complete information. If you’re in the US check out the Hearing Loss Association of America at hearing loss.org. I’ve learned so much from them and you do t have to be a member to access their resources. You can handle this with help from those who know. Good luck!

Thanks for explaining further. I’m not an audiologist so I hesitate to contradict what you were told after three tests, but I decided to google “no hearing aids for mild hearing loss.” I did so based on your clear description of when you have trouble understanding words. You’re better than most people at identifying and describing your challenges. I do know loss of high frequencies is the most common symptom. It especially impacts how well we understand in noisy environments. Most Google results say people can be helped. Here’s what the Cleveland Clinic (a trusted source) says”:
 Even people with a mild degree of hearing loss may find that they are having trouble hearing what they should. Today’s digital hearing aids give audiologists the capability of programming the aids to fit a wide range of hearing losses. You don’t need to have a lot of hearing loss to find that a hearing loss can cause you a lot of frustration. Persons with a mild hearing loss may find that they have difficulty hearing quiet speech, or hearing someone speaking from a distance. If a hearing loss is negatively affecting your life it’s time to schedule an appointment with an audiologist to find out what amplification options could benefit you. “Hearing aids are for people with a great deal of hearing loss. I just have a mild hearing loss, I don’t need hearing aids.” There are many options available to help people with any degree of hearing loss – from mild to profound. An audiologist can review these options to see which would be the best fit for you!”
 I identify with your frustration but I don’t want to cause you trouble with your provider, so please proceed as you feel comfortable. Sometimes second opinion can be a good idea.",2025-11-02 01:12:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om4j0o/im_new_here_any_advice_how_are_the_people_here/
1om2xz0,hardofhearing,Has anyone experienced this?,"Went for a hearing test yesterday and the results were 3 losses between 1-8hz at 30db and the rest were at 20db in one ear, the other has a drop at 4hz at 40db and the rest were at 15/20db.

For the worse ear, she said a HA wouldn’t help even though I fall short in 3 areas despite working with primary children and having tinnitus. Real world experience was quickly dismissed.

She said if I’d been 70+ she would have given me tablets for the tinnitus (didn’t know that was an option…) and HA’s won’t do anything for the tinnitus.

She asked about the tinnitus and I said it was predominantly in one ear but I could hear it in both. Was I sure it was only one ear because if it was I need an mri but if it’s both I don’t. I’ve had the tinnitus for 10+ years. 

She then asked ‘so what are you going to do?’ and I said get a new job as I can’t hear the children with the background noise so I’m effectively unable to do my job. 

The next statement from her ‘I’ll write a letter and see if you can have one as you’re borderline’ despite being at 3 30db losses. Who exactly is she writing to? 

As I was leaving she ended on saying ‘I’ll put you forward for a HA, if it doesn’t work at least we’ve tried’.

I’m in the north of England and have waited 18 months for the NHS appointment and when I got there I felt I had to beg for help and she was spouting BS, am I the only one or was she right in what she said?

Reading this over I feel it’s more of a vent but I’m curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar? 



[댓글]
I was told by my audiologist that he wouldn’t push me for hearing aids as that was my decision to make. With that being said I’m not sure exactly who she’s writing to. Maybe because your hearing loss isn’t severe enough she’s worried that the manufacturer/ hospital won’t want to float the cost. 









Additionally while I understand that hearing aids aren’t necessarily a treatment for tinnitus I don’t understand why she wouldn’t give you treatment for it. Ask for a second option from someone else and get an appointment with an ent if you haven’t.

Definitely get a second opinion. The NHS is a fantastic resource but it's so overstretched and underfunded, it's a struggle to get the help you're supposed to be entitled to. When you find the right person it's amazing and they can change your life, but it's a fight to find the right professional and then say the right thing to them. I was born deaf but I was 26 by the time I got an appointment with a professor in ENT, I said ""no matter how loud the hearing aids are, nothing ever gets any clearer"" - and because of him, I got my BAHA processor on my 27th birthday :) Before him, they just kept turning my hearing aids up and up and up...

Stand your ground the best you can. Write down everything she said while you can remember it and at the next appointment, ask them to explain everything in detail. Bring a handy hearing person to sit in with you if you've got one. I'm in my thirties but still ask my mum to come with me to these type of appointments because she's great at asking WHO are you writing to, when I'm still processing that she'll write to someone.",2025-11-01 23:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1om2xz0/has_anyone_experienced_this/

I have experienced a couple panic attacks in therapy and due to that I can't lip-read my therpaist so she can't help me to regulate and work through the panic attack. Does anyone have any ideas for how she could help me during a panic attack when I can't lip-read her to follow directions etc? 

[댓글]
This is in person? Instead of just talking through she could model techniques that do not rely heavily on verbal instructions. For example, the butterfly tap can be demonstrated. And also, you need to have a conversation about this and come to an agreement as to what helps in these situations. She is the therapist but you are the expert of your experience.

Literally text on paper and body language. And very important: talk about it and agree on what the steps are and somewhat rehearse what to do while you're okay. Trying to teach someone how to get theough it while they're in the deep end is hard regardless of ability to communicate.

I’m so sorry you’re suffering with panic attacks. You might want to try Live Transcribe or another transcription app. There also are therapists who specialize in working with deaf and hard of hearing patients. (((HUGS)))

My family has a lot of HoH people but no one knows sign. What has worked in these situations is having a plan ahead of time and hand signals. Like we have one for ""sensory overload, I need to go outside,"" and one for ""I need space right now, can't talk."" Maybe different techniques could have signals, or you could use visual cards. This isn't the same as a full language like sign language but thats how my family gets by.",2025-11-01 10:13:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1olk8kx/panic_attacks_in_therapy_cant_lipread/

1ol2v7m,hardofhearing,Pros and cons of rechargeable hearing aids?,"Looking to get new hearing aids in the next year, but I've been told by my audiologist that my only options are rechargeable ones. I regularly listen to music through bluetooth at work, so I'm worried about how long the hearing aids would last before needing to be charged again. My current pair are from Oticon, so I'd appreciate any reviews that are specific to them. Thanks!

[댓글]
I have rechargeable oticons, and I’m so happy I made the switch. Mine are connected to my phone by Bluetooth 24/7, and the charge typically lasts about 20 hours. It’s been an absolute godsend to not have to think about carrying batteries everywhere.

i had battery driven ones, and now i have rechargeable ones. I must say battery is 100 times better. You can buy batteries from amazon like 400 for 20€ or something. 

I just hate the fact that you have to spend extra 200€ on a box that can charge your batteries and dry them. And if you forget to charge them ( what happens to me sometimes) the day will be hard. If you forget battery you can jsut go to a shop nearby and buy  them there. 

If i had to choose again i would buy batterie driven hearing aids. 

Also they are often 100€-200€ cheaper.

I have Phonak hearing aids. I regularly use the Bluetooth option. It lasts me from 7am to 10pm so pretty much all day, even when using the Bluetooth. I can't think of any inconveniences for me at the moment, has them for 4 years.

I listen to music pretty much continuously from waking up until bedtime on my HAs and have maybe once had the battery run out (and that in my right ear which has the volume higher thanks to that ear being worse). I wouldn’t get anything else.

I resisted for a long time for god knows why and I wish I’d made the switch sooner.

Your audiologist is either misinformed or lying.  There are battery options for many hearing aid brands/models--even the Oticon website shows battery options.  Our son (19) insists on battery hearing aids and just received a new pair in September.  He sticks with Resound the majority of the time (he has the Nexia model right now).  He had rechargeable Phonaks a while back and returned them within the return window.  He didn't like the sound quality, and he streams a ton, so he was having to use his old ones as backup while the Phonaks were charging.  He also likes to wear at least one to bed (yeah, I know...), so he has at least one in 24/7.

  
We had a three day power outage a while back, and he was quite thankful for the battery hearing aids.  He wouldn't have been able to charge them.  Also, rechargeables degrade in battery life over time.  Probably an unpopular opinion, but it's definitely what works better for the way our son uses them.

Rechargeable batteries have a finite life.

Modern rechargeable batteries can last all day. I have signia HAs and they never want to sit in the charger right, so I have woken up to a dead battery several times. Some HAs use induction charging to solve that problem. 

I have the same signia HAs with disposable batteries. Overall, I like the disposable batteries more. One downside, in the US, is the new packaging.

Well now you have me wondering if listening via Bluetooth has more impact on the battery than just regular daily listening (not Bluetooth). I would think it wouldn't make much difference, but I don't actually know. 



FWIW, I have Phonak, Audeo P90. I charge them overnight and the battery lasts from 6 am until about 10 pm, with probably not more than an hour or so of streaming a podcast or book. Music sounds a little weird through the HAs and I can't figure out what setting to change, and it's not worth it to me to spend the money for an audiologist appointment so she can click this or that setting so that my music sounds right. So I just use AirPods or a speaker to listen to music. I can fit the AirPods in with the HAs still in, and it's not a great fit but good enough. I can hear well enough that if the fit is bothering me I just take out the HAs and use the AirPods alone.  



Despite the hassle of needing to charge them (and needing to recharge them partway through the day if I'm going to be staying up late), I still like them better than batteries. I was always having my battery die when I was out, and I never carried batteries around with me every day but I hated to waste part of the battery by changing them too early. Once I was on my way to the movies when I heard the telltale signal and I had to pull over and make an emergency run to the drugstore for new ones. Plus the guilt of throwing all those batteries in the landfill or trying to find a place that accepts batteries for recycling (now basically impossible)...it was a bummer. So I'm Team Rechargeable.

I had no choice with my Phonaks, they only come with rechargeables.  However they easily last all day with a fair amount of bluetooth use and luckily I haven't forgotten the charger on overnight trips.

Most people i know who has them and who have also had HA's with batteries say theyre a downgrade.

Im from the Netherlands where we get insurance cover for 75% every 5 years for new HAs. The last time i purposefully went with battery charged HAs because of all the negative reviews.

I did notice a lot of technical improvements from the 5 year ones before that (2017 vs 2022) though I must say, these ones are becoming shittier and shittier and I kind of really need new ones now but i gotta wait so long.

Im really hoping by the time im eligble for new ones the rechargable situation has improved a lot atleast.

Im sticking by rechargeable! I have the Phonak Audeo rechargeable and the battery lasts close to 24 hours if I don't stream anything. I LOVE the fact that they're Bluetooth and I can take calls and listen to music on em when needed. The reason why I got phonak is that they have an extra battery pack you can add to the charging case for traveling and its been a blessing!

I'm about to start working in the medical field, so this was a must have. Rechargeable for life! No more lost batteries, or dead battery packages. 

Only downside is if the battery does, you have to send the whole aid in to get fixed. I hate doing that since I NEED both to function. Luckily, I've always had temporary devices available, but I would rather there was a better way around it.

My considerations — I like the rechargeable but these are the pros and cons:

* You will lose your charger. You either need two or you need a plan for what to do while you wait for the new one to arrive. It's not like a phone charger.
* You can buy batteries in any drugstore.
* Batteries can give out at any point during the day, leaving you fumbling to replace them during a meeting or dinner. Rechargeables if you store them at night will last through the day.
* If you're listening to music a lot, you will run through a lot of batteries.
* The new battery packaging is hot garbage and may be a ploy by Big Battery to get you to go rechargeable.
* Before your 3 year warranty is up on the rechargeables, you can send your HAs in for a warranty replacement and they will give you new ones. They do not do that for the battery version.

I’m on my third set of OTICON HA’s and my current set is rechargeable and THEY ARE THE BEST!  The charge lasts up to 15 hours and that’s with me using the tv sound converter box via Bluetooth and/or listening to music. ♥️👍🏼🤩

I am awful at remembering my HA when I get home since I only use them in public. My batteries last like 4-5 days and I don’t think they cost too much

I made the switch to rechargable oticon hearing aids last September (2024). I will never go back to battery powered hearing aids.  They've changed my life.  I'm a mom of 3, ADHD and it's one less thing for me to remember. It's awful to be out with the kids and have to stop and buy hearing aid batteries bc the diaper bag didn't have the new package.  Also, I've only had them die once but it's because I woke up at 4am, put them on, used them all day till almost 11pm... Insane battery life with the charge.  And they connect right to my phone. It's so nice!

I've only tried rechargeable ones but they last 16h for me so I don't have issues with them running out and I always remember to charge them with my phone and my smart watch every night. However I do get worried I'll lose the charging box thing as they are ridiculously overpriced plus then I'll be stuck until I can get a new charger.

My HAs use 312 batteries and is &gt;3 years old now. When I replace them it’ll probably be rechargeable. 

How many charging cycles do the batteries last and are they replaced? If yes, what is the cost?

I have rechargeable phonaks- they bluetooth stream well and they last all day even if I'm streaming.

I listen to audiobooks. My last from when I get up in the morning to when I go to bed at night.

I'm in the process of getting new hearing aids too. I've had my set of rechargeable hearing aids for going on 6 years, previously had a few iterations of replaceable battery hearing aids (essentially from the age of 5 to 14, so 9 years). 

I'll say, that the rechargeable hearing aids are great, the battery life throughout the day (even after 6 years, and only minor repairs to some parts) is amazing, I can usually get 20-ish hours of use on a low Bluetooth day, and 16\~18-ish hours on a day with a lot of music and videos. 

The only issue I seem to come across with them is that \*when\* you do forget to plug them in over-night, you're out of hearing aids for a day, unless you can charge them on-the-way-to or at work, or whatever thing you need to do that day. However, if your current hearing aids are still serviceable, it may be beneficial if you are able to keep them to work for the hour-to-three-hours that it takes to charge the hypothetical new ones; that way, you make up for the down time that charging takes up.",2025-10-31 18:47:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ol2v7m/pros_and_cons_of_rechargeable_hearing_aids/
1okscwg,hardofhearing,Plugged Feeling but Everything Normal?,"Hey all!

Had moderate to severe hearing loss in my left and deaf in my right ear my whole life.

A few weeks ago after my Rituximaub infusion for MS, I noticed something felt off.

Felt plugged up or sounds muted a bit. Went to a CVS MinuteClinic and no signs of ear infection. Went to an ENT and had a bit of wax removed and a hearing test.

Test showed a 5 drop in the 250 range and like 15 in 10k and above.

My ear was puffy from wax removal and both the ENT and my normal audiologist didn't see anything concerning as the changes fell within normal range of error.

If I clear my eustachian tubes everything sounds better. Been taking a generic antihistamine to try and help.

Finally, my hearing aid is an Oticon OPN so not sure if that thing is EOL since its old.

Long story short to say I have no idea if this is weirdly psychological since according to the experts nothing is wrong?  

[댓글]
It could be psychological or it could residual puffiness from the cleaning or slight inflammation or irritation from something like allergies

That plugged feeling can totally happen even when tests look normal. It could be mild Eustachian tube stuffiness or just your brain adjusting post-wax removal. Give it time, stay on the antihistamine, and maybe get your OPN checked older aids can sometimes distort sound a bit.",2025-10-31 11:47:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1okscwg/plugged_feeling_but_everything_normal/
1oks8st,hardofhearing,Are children loud(er than average) because of HoH parent?,"I had mild-moderate hearing loss when my first child was born 6 years ago and I got my first hearing aids around the same time. In the meantime I progressed to moderate-severe loss, which was only detected a year ago. I'm just now testing new aids and adjustment is difficult, my world suddenly got really really noisy again. Especially my kids (4 and 6).  
I knew that they are ""of the louder variety"" already. They like loud play (stomping, running, shouting, arguing...) but also their normal talking voice seems louder than average.   
Their father keeps complaining how loud they are (his hearing is very good). And we had neighbours complaining that our kids are too loud (we live in an appartment building).   
And I myself feel that I cannot really assess their noise level. With the new hearing aids they aften seem sooo loud (but the rustling of my jacket is also really loud...), without it's no problem (obviously).  
  
Now It suddenly occured to me: what if it's me being HoH causing my kids to be so loud? That they feel the need to be loud to be heard, literally.  
What are the experiences of other HoH parents?

edit: vocabulary

[댓글]
I think in general when they’re younger no. Little kids are loud because they haven’t learned to control their volume yet. However older kids say around the age of 10 might be louder if their parents are hard of hearing. That’s because they have learned that they need to be louder than normal for their parent to hear them.

I'm HoH (severe-profound), lost my hearing around age 2, but it wasn't diagnosed until I was 4. the teachers and doctors were actually concerned my brother had hearing loss because he was so loud, so he got tested before I did, but it was just that he was speaking loudly for me. all my siblings are louder than normal, and I have a loud family in general, in part because I'm HoH. I never noticed it growing up (obviously, to me it was a good volume), but my wife was the one who pointed out to me that I have a loud family lol. I don't know if that's common, with children being louder because of HoH family members, but it happened here!

I'm loud, but I'm also hoh/deaf 

I grew up with family who were hoh given we had to SPEAK up 

My whole family is loud 
We don't yell we project, lol 😆

Totally possible kids naturally adapt to how we respond. If they learned Mom hears better when they’re louder, they’ll keep doing it. Also, with new aids, *everything* sounds extra intense at first. Give it time your brain will adjust, and they’ll learn volume control too.

I think it’s common for Hard of Hearing people to be annoyed by noise, since hearing aids don’t cope with noise well. It’s difficult to communicate if it’s noisy. I probably hush people, require good lighting and eye contact. Loud volume is not something I appreciate, the hearing aids can amplify, from people I expect clear speech.

I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and HoH in my left. So, my kids grew up with the fact that I couldn't hear well and also couldn't afford a hearing aid. 

My youngest daughter is 32 and a couple of months ago, at work, was told by a coworker that she ""laughs too loud and talks too loud"" sometimes. She said: ""Oh, sorry. My mom is deaf and sometimes I forget that I don't have to be loud."" The person scoffed with a ""yeah, right"" before walking away. I asked her: ""Do you want me to come to your office and stand next to her desk and not respond to her when she demands to know who I am and what I'm doing there? Because I WILL!""

My son (34) was once told by a woman he was seeing that he ""laughed too loud"". I told him that wasn't a ""deaf mom"" thing so much as it was ""we're a family of cackle-laughing seagulls"" thing.

I have a four year old grandgoblin and sometimes, my daughter (the 36 year old) will ask me how I was able to tolerate three noisy kids. I just smiled and took out my hearing aids: ""I didn't have these!""

Yep. Household of five here, 3 are hoh. The baby of the family has normal hearing, but boy is she LOUD. Ha!

I’m the kind of hoh person that just wants the important info. My kids (2&amp;4) are surprisingly not loud but I do think they’ll probably come across as rude as they get older because it’s acceptable in our house to just say “nevermind” when I don’t hear or speak with a loud angry tone if it’s important. E.g. if the situation isn’t easy for hearing I usually just answer with “I can’t hear you” or “is it important?”. I often can’t be bothered making the effort to hear. 

Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re fairly quiet when they’re older. In a 2 storey house my husband and I often just text each other instead of yelling. I assume the kids will be the same when they get phones. Hoping to learn a bit of my country’s sign language when the kids are a bit older.",2025-10-31 11:41:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oks8st/are_children_louder_than_average_because_of_hoh/
1okjxo3,hardofhearing,Battery life shorter?,"Anyone else notice battery life getting shorter? 

My 612s used to last a week, then the time got down to 5 days, now the time is 3 days. Nothing in my daily routine has changed.

[댓글]
Check if there is a bluetooth option, &amp; if so disable it - bluetooth is radio, which sucks battery life. I also discovered with my new aids that had a different battery compartment, that closing the hearing aid overnight storage container lids would compress on the hearing aid battery compartment, turning the aid on, reducing battery life!

Are your batteries the same make over the years? 
Also, if your batteries are of the zinc-air type then they should come with a sticker on one side. This is to cover the air access hole. Air activates this kind of battery, which then slowly discharges, lessening its life. Ensure to leave the sticker on until you are ready to actually replace a flat battery.

Seems the only other things that have changed are the make of batteries, &amp; the models of hearing aids. Can you pinpoint a time that reduced battery life coincides with either of those changes?

Might be more features on your hearing aids draining battery, higher volumes if your hearing has deteriorated at all, listening to more noise throughout the day or using Bluetooth more?

I used to have a noisy job and it certainly made a difference. I have rechargeable though.

Yes! I felt like the first I used my hearing aids they lasted for a couple weeks now I only get a week out of them. My perception  of time isn’t the best so I thought I was going nuts. Additionally my hearing aids are linked by Bluetooth to my phone and I use them a lot so I figured it made sense they only last a week

As batteries age or humidity changes, life drops fast. Could also be firmware updates or more Bluetooth streaming. Try a fresh pack or different brand to compare.",2025-10-31 03:14:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1okjxo3/battery_life_shorter/

If this is not normal hearing is there a way I can prevent more hearing loss?

You should probably make an appointment with an audiologist and they can explain your results. 


Normal hearing is between 0-25db so 15db is fine.

That does sound below typical thresholds. Since you already have tinnitus, it’s worth getting a full audiogram from an audiologist.",2025-10-30 15:48:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ok3auc/did_a_hearing_test_in_todays_lab/

If the issue is you can't hear your surroundings or yourself talking, open back headphones will fix this

Maybe bone conduction headset

If you don‘t wear hearing aids (which you could BT stream the audio with, and control the balance between audio stream and outside world (hearing aid mics)), and if you don‘t want to use open over the ear headphones, there are also ear buds that do not occlude the ear canal (e.g. Sony‘s „LinkBuds Open“).",2025-10-29 20:44:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ojg2sz/gaming_for_hard_of_hearing/

I am hard of hearing beginning in my 30s. It’s tough, I won’t lie to you. It can be very lonely, at least for me, because it’s hard for me to hear in group settings.

However, it truly has made me focus on the type of people that will be supportive of me regardless, which has shown me the type of people I want to have in my life. 

If you do have hearing loss, the most important thing you can do is to get tested. I know firsthand it’s scary as hell, but if you leave hearing loss without treatment (whether that’s steroids, surgery, or hearing aids), your hearing nerve and brain will get used to not having the sound input. That can cause long-lasting damage to both.

So please get tested. Cry and scream at the results if you need to. But please know that having something “wrong” with you, if that’s what the test shows… simply means you’re human. 

Not better. Not worse. Just human.

I had to start therapy and was prescribed Zoloft. Both really helped!

Have they tried putting a tube in your ear with the pressure yet?

Let me ask a few questions, if I might. 

When did this dysfunction occur? Was it a sudden onset? If so, can you tell me the circumstances surrounding it? 

I hear do you live? Have you always lived there?

How are your sinuses?

Oh to add, I’m kind of scared? Hearing aids are so expensive. Is there anywhere I can find them for something more reasonable?

You could post here or at r/AudiProcDisorder.

Having a processing disorder is often associated with hearing loss (depending on your disorder) they tend to go hand in hand. 

Hearing loss is something EVERYONE will experience in life, I’m glad you’re able to read lips, it’s extremely helpful and you are welcome in EVERY COMMUNITY!

I too have auditory processing disorder (ANSD) and all my hearing tests were normal and I finally got to know about ANSD after a ABR/bera test.
For me too, over the years (especially after covid and resulting very limited social interaction) it has become just a little bit difficult to understand people and ask them again and again (specially in noisy enviornment with more than 55 db of background noise). My Audiologist also recommended a hearing device to me.
I guess hearing issues does form a broad spectrum and we all can share and learn from each other's perspective and experience 😃

Plus you’ll prolly still find usefull/relatable info

I’ve never heard the term Auditory Processing Disorder, but it sounds like me. 

I lost 40% of the hearing in my left ear in 1995. But the loss was to the tone test. When it comes to identifying the sound, or speech, or what direction the sound comes from, I can’t do that with the left ear. If the right ear is brought into play, my comprehension score comes up, but still not anywhere near 100%. I also still can’t tell what direction sound comes from. 

Is that what ANSD is?

I was born an estimated 50% deaf in my right ear, although I’d debate that I’m more 75%, sounds that’d be painfully loud are like soft voices. But my left ear can hear fine, although I’ve admittedly given myself tinnitus from years of poor choices with earbud volume. 

Especially since you need hearing aids, I think the label would fit for you. I don’t even have hearing aids right now, although lord knows I’m trying.

Audioprocessing is a neurological condition that affects how your brain processes audio. Physically, you still have the ability  to hear. 

Hearing loss  is physical. Loss of hearing.  

2 separate things. They actually have a reddit for APD, though. 

I don't think you need permission from strangers on the internet it's a free country. 

You do what feels best 👌🏼

That is absolutely not true. 

Not all processing disorders are related to auditory dysfunction. 

For example, you can be dyslexic and deaf. You can have sensory textile processing disorders and be deaf. You can have cognitive dissonance disorders and be deaf. 
There’s a whole SLEW of processing disorders that have and don’t have anything to do with the auditory system. 
The issue is there is not a set of official guidelines in the ICD-11 Consult or the DSM5-TR, in fact, currently Processing Disorders and APD are not included in either due to a whole slew of factors. 

(Mainly, they don’t know jack shit about ANY of these so they can’t properly explain, diagnose nor treat them. If you haven’t LIVED or experienced a processing disorder, how, I ask, will you understand it?    You don’t. )",2025-10-28 22:59:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oioaz7/im_unsure_if_i_am_allowed_to_be_apart_of_the/
1oil0cp,hardofhearing,Can't find reliable sound-sensor/vibration system,"I've been looking for a bed-shaker system that will alert me to sounds. I've tried two or three models, but they all have this really frustrating and confusing wrinkle: the sound sensors that transmit to them only detect LONG sounds. They often seem to be marketed as ""baby cry sensors.""

That is, they'll detect most ringtones, or a person going ""AHHHHHHHHH!"", but they won't detect a person *shouting* my name (which is just one syllable). More worryingly, I found that the one I'm using currently won't even reliably detect a smoke detector going off, even when the smoke detector is right next to the sensor!! Presumably this is because the smoke detector beeps are very short and/or high-pitched. I have no idea why this ""long sounds only"" feature is a thing. Maybe they want to protect from waking you when a door opens or closes? But hell, if it'd disturb a hearing person, I'd like it to disturb me!

Does anyone use a sound sensor/vibration system, and have you found one that is reliable for short sounds?

1ohnf3v,hardofhearing,95 year old grandfather can’t hear almost anything on phone through hearing aids &amp; barely anything in person through them. I tested him using earbuds &amp; he could hear great. Should I set him up like this permanently or are there risks to what little heading he has left?,"His hearing doctor is also a ways away and has not seemed to be helpful in the past and it’s a huge headache to get him to that doctor, so I’m hoping to just do this myself but don’t want to ruin his existing hearing.

I’d have to buy and replace his phones (wireless home phones) with phones that have a headphone jack.

Before I do all of that I’m wondering if there’s a better approach. I know they have hearing impaired phones with a large speaker but I’m unsure if those will be any better than just yelling into his ear. I know the earbuds work. I’m also wondering if I should be considering over ear headphones that way he doesn’t have to take his hearing aids out and tell people “hold on” every time someone calls, but I know in the past overear headphones for watching TV have interfered with his hearing aids and caused them to shut off, unsure if that’s because the over ear headphones for his TV were wireless though. So I just want to keep things as simple/reliable as possible while also not damaging his hearing. And considering his hearing is already damages are there are volume limitations I should set up/get a pair of headphones that CANT go past a certain db reading to further damage his hearing? 

Furthermore, if this works out I’m wondering if I should be thinking about alternatives for his hearing aid situation in general. He can’t hear at all on the phone and he can barely hear in person, so I’m wondering if I should look into/make a setup that is basically just earbuds permanently in place of hearing aids but with a Microphone strapped to his hip or whatever (possibly a directional microphone that points where he is looking/at the person he’s talking to?) that then feeds to his hearing aids? And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

I’m just past the point of wanting to go through the Dr because he’s went to this Dr many times and cannot hear a damned thing through his hearing aids yet I use a random pair of earbuds from home and he could hear clear as day. So I’m hesitant to burn 10+ hours going back and forth to Dr to get new hearing aids and spend a bunch of money for something proprietary that might not even work. 

[댓글]
I think he needs a new doctor to check his hearing if possible

See a new audiologist. Why keep going back if you're not getting what you want out of it.

If he is able,  transcription apps allow us to l read what is being said irt....  A way to keep communication open until his audiologist helps

Another vote for a new doctor. 

When you say Hearing Doctor, I want to be sure we are on the same page. I’m talking about an ENT, or a licensed Audiologist with a partnership with an ENT, at the least. Please don’t take him to one of the mass market hearing aid places. I’m referring to Beltone, Miracle Ear, Clear Tone etc. 

I’m sorry to say there are too many people out there that don’t want to invest the extra time it takes to work with some of our older seniors. Your Grandfather is a member of the greatest generation that ever lived, and we all owe them a debt of gratitude. A little extra time spent working with them sometimes results in hearing about history we didn’t know.

New doctor/audiologist.

There's transcription apps. **Live Transcribe** is popular and works well. I have one too but its not out in eu yet.

Earbuds like for a walkman or amplifier? Or AirPods? If it's the latter, if that works hey, I mean not really recommended but ppl are doing that. If it's the former, eh. Do they have costco where you are? They'll do an audiogram with their in house audiologists and sell you a hearing aid and not an amplifier.

They have multiple (hardware) transcription devices for phones too. I have moderate hearing loss and I rarely have any idea what anyone is saying on the phone. I just put it on speaker and tell people to feel free to shout. I'm ok on zoom etc since I speechread.

&gt;And then at dinner and that kind of thing he could have the mic placed on table where it gets input from everyone around? 

Nothing works in a crowded room, it's why I won't generally wear hearing aids. That was the only thing that mattered for where I used to work (teaching). It was listening to a cacophony of overlapping human speech. Focusing on a single speaker was like picking out water drops in the rain. When you amplify that it's just a louder cacophony, not easier to discriminate sounds or speakers.

A lot of hearing aids just do not work well either and many audiologists are just glorified (hearing) appliance salespeople. I think you found one of those w/your grandfather.

Hope that helps and lots of luck! *fingers crossed*

It's wild how regular earbuds sometimes work better than expensive hearing aids. Just be careful with the volume so it doesn't blast his ears even if he can't hear well. You could also look into OTCs. They're kind of the middle ground between regular earbuds and full-on prescription hearing aids. My FIL has the audien ion pro and they've been amazing for everyday stuff without the constant doctor trips.

I wonder if government phones might have some of those helpful hearing impaired phones I've never heard of that but I'm about to ask them if they do if you have those government phones where you are I would try that too but definitely a new audiologist if this one isn't helping it's a lot of searching around for the perfect one but I'm sure you'll find maybe a better one closer",2025-10-27 19:07:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ohnf3v/95_year_old_grandfather_cant_hear_almost_anything/

You can get a disk that vibrates to put olunder your pillow, and that's connected to the alarm systems. Some people have lights that will flash too.

Does anyone know if there is a way that I can get a hearing test without a doctor's order? I know I can do that at Costco, but they only let you get one every six months, and I last had a hearing test four months ago. But if I’ve experienced sudden hearing loss now, I need to get treatment *now*. Not two months from now. Also, if I get a hearing test without a doctor's order, my medical insurance probably won’t pay for it. So I'm also wondering how much a hearing test actually costs, if I have to pay out of pocket.

For sudden unexplained hearing loss your dr should get you in right away. Outside of Costco i don’t know whereas you could to get a hearing test not approved by a dr. I think the amount it cost can vary state to state so to be on the safe side you should google your area

I have no idea what the situation state-side is (where I presume you are?) but in Canada I was definitely able to just call up a hearing clinic and ask them for an appointment directly (I didn't have a GP at the time).

You need to see an ENT, not just an audiologist at a hearing aid shop. Call your insurance to see if you need Referral

I walked into the local clinic and said I think I'm going deaf ... No doctors no papers they set me up with an appointment. Now may differ based on location though

I've never had a doctor order a hearing test recently before 2020. I have been the one ordering them. I go to the office that deals with my hearing aids or the hospital where I had my CI surgery.

The hearing aid places will give you a free hearing test to sell you hearing aids, they are audiologists. You just have to be prepared to walk away &amp; finagle your results. That’s a quick, free answer before you see your ENT (not a substitute for)

Try free phone apps or Costco

I have the oticon ones with the actual hearing aid that sits behind the ear and the molded earpiece that goes into the ear. It is quite easy just to pull that bit out. —as opposed to hearing aids that are just little buds or something.

Anyway, so Yes, absolutely I will just pull the ear piece out and let them hang until whatever foolishness is over with.

Edit: I don’t know why, but your question reminded me of a story about Ian McKellan. He’d gone to see a play where one of his friends was starring. Afterwards he was giving the usual praise about how much he enjoyed it, and the friend replied, “We could tell you enjoyed it, you didn’t even take out your hearing aids!” Idk why that tickled me so much. Maybe bc I’d never thought about being “caught” doing it!

Ugh, loud sudden noises are rough. You can try asking your audiologist to tweak your compression settings. It can help dampen sharp spikes like that. Personally, I use audien ion pro and they seem a bit less reactive to sharp noise compared to my older ones. They got quick-switch profiles for noisy places so I can just tap to tone things down.

I really only wear mine to work or to situations where I need to understand every single word. The world is so noisy. If I'm just going out to run errands or at home I will typically leave them out and rely on lip reading and asking for clarification. I can still hear lots of things but it's easier to tune out. I do get easily overwhelmed when I wear them in a loud environment. I will turn them all the way down, or like the other comment said just pop the speakers out of my ear canals

If the sounds are bothering you, turn your hearing aids down or off! That's what I do; there's no use hearing when it does more harm than good, especially for loud noises that can actually damage your hearing in the long run.

Hearing aids don't help me in most situations- im HOH in one ear- it actually overstimulates me in situations where there is more than one person or child talking

I work in an upper elementary school in SPED. I’ve absolutely taken my hearing aids out while dealing with a student who is escalated and being very loud. It’s damaging my hearing by leaving them in, not to mention probably going to trigger a vertigo attack for me. Maybe it’s rude, but tbf I don’t think my students have ever noticed it in the moment.

I am in the same situation.  I had my audiologist set one of the buttons on my hearing aides to mute so I can quickly mute when a loud sound happens.  I live in the city so the ambulances and fire trucks are super loud.  When I take the subway I wear Sony earphones over the ear kind over my hearing aides.  I don’t even turn them on or anything ,  just having them up over my hears is enough to dull the screeching subway trains.  I also have a custom “ calm” setting that I made for noisy situations where I still want to hear but way softer like noisy restaurants or my office where the loud overhead AC vents drive me nuts..

I struggle with this situation - and am not convinced that wearing hearing aids in loud areas doesn't further damage your ears.  Doesn't the loud noise you no longer hear still damage your hearing??

I recently opted to put earplugs in my ears when out on long walks rather than wear my hearing aids.  The every increasing traffic noise has been too much for me - I stopped looking forward to walks.   So now I just leave hearing aids at home and plug my ears with those simple foam ear plugs to reduce the decibels.  I can still hear the hum of traffic and my head swivels around paying attention to the traffic, people, cyclists etc around me.  My ears no longer hurt after a long walk, since I cut out the over exposure to noise. 

I don't believe that my decision to remove hearing aids and wear ear plugs is ideal  - but it still doesn't make sense that wearing aids in loud environments doesn't further harm my hearing; especially when my ears physically hurt after lengthy exposure to environment.  It's not like you can quickly cover your ears when a car or store alarm goes off.

I am interested in this post and look forward to reading all comments.

I honestly just pop open the battery compartments so the hearing aids *block* noise instead

Unfortunately the answer you don’t want to hear is……. You get what you pay for, I have a profound hearing loss and have worn hearing aides since I was 22.  I am now 56, and have grown through all of the technological advancements.  Set aside the arguments that you shouldn’t have to pay this much to hear and just accept reality, it is what it is.
Get the absolute highest technology from a reputable doctor of audiology and you will find this day and age has automatic noise reduction built in.  They will automatically turn down the volume when sensing the incoming volume is a certain percentage above ambient sound.  Obviously it’s more complicated than that but we don’t need to know the physics, we just want to hear.  You will find it strange at first when it happens because it will also give you a perceived pressure change that takes some getting used to.
Make sure you get quality custom ear molds and a quality audiologist that will be patient with you.  After I get my new ones it typically takes about 6 weeks of at east once a week appointments for the audiologist to get them dialed in for my use.  If they are not willing, they are not worth your money.  Remember, if your audiologist is not hearing impaired themselves, they do not know what it’s like to have this affliction.

Fast forward to today my blocked ear suddenly popped its fullness away, but my other ear felt a little blocked after that. I tried the method where I block and blow out of my house to pop the tubes, but when I did that, my right ear felt blocked again. Does anyone know what could be going on with my eustachian tubes?

You should speak to Elivania Abreu, Fonoaudióloga

You have a high frequency hearing loss. Search for ""speech banana"", map your loss,  and you can see the speech you will miss . Your audiologist should be able to give you an explamation. If they can't,  find a new one!.

The line in red goes down and then up a little bit, the other line goes down not as rapidly.

In short, you can hear (roughly) normally in most frequencies, but you don't hear higher pitched sounds nearly as well. Your ears are roughly the same, but your left ear is your better ear. This may mean you have trouble hearing certain speech sounds and quiet high pitched noises like electricity whine, whispering, sounds from small animals and insects, etc. It doesn't mean that you *can't* hear those noises, just that you have more difficulty than the typical person. 

I'm not an audiologist, just hard of hearing myself, so I can't say whether hearing aids would be needed, but if your audiologist/hearing aid tech recommends them, I would look into it if financially feasible. Unaided hearing loss has been linked to increased rates of dementia in later life, so it does have implications for brain health.

Looks like mine from 5 years ago.

The line of the left is percentage of sound heard compared to normal hearing. The negative # is better than normal. The numbers on the top are frequency starting from very low to medium sound, drums, vibration, low notes pretty well but I can't hear higher so high women's voices. (ie soprano}, become indisputably non existent.

Disclaimer: I am not an audiologist, but from my understanding as someone who has studied audiology in undergrad,
You have a bilateral high frequency hearing loss that is slightly asymmetrical. The degree in your right ear is moderately severe at high frequencies (over 4k Hz), and the degree in your left is is moderate at high frequencies (over 4k Hz). At all other frequencies (4k and below) you have normal hearing. It looks like you only had air conduction tested, and without also testing bone conduction, the type of loss cannot be determined for certain.

I want this hearing : (

X-axis is the frequency of the sound.


Y-axis is how loud that frequency has to be in order for you to hear it.


The shaded area is a normal range of hearing. Anything in the white area indicates hearing loss in that frequency. The lower you go, the worse the hearing loss is.


You have moderate high frequency hearing loss.",2025-10-24 19:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1of7maq/can_you_explain_my_audiogram_in_detail_if_possible/

1ode1rg,hardofhearing,Sudden hearing loss after blowing my nose – anyone had this and recovered?,"I’m 25 and a today I was congested from a cold. I tried to pop my ears by blowing gently into my closed nose — and I felt a small “pop” in my left ear.

Right after that, I got dizzy, nauseous, and even threw up once. Since then, my left ear feels full, I hear almost nothing from it, and there’s constant ringing.

I went to the ENT today and got diagnosed with:

Sudden hearing loss (hypoacusis) due to barotrauma

The eardrum looks fine (not ruptured), but they confirmed significant hearing loss on the left side. Tomorrow I’m going for another hearing test and likely steroid treatment.

Has anyone here experienced sudden hearing loss after pressure / blowing your nose, and did your hearing recover?
How long did it take, and did you do any specific treatments (steroids, oxygen therapy, etc.)?

[댓글]
It very possible that this can be an issue that can be corrected by having tubes (or a tube) put in ear(s).

Can you describe what you hear? Is it muffled/stuffy? Like it seems like your ears are suddenly stuffed?

Go to emergency, if there is any chance that the loss is due to lack of blood/oxygen to the ear, the longer you wait the higher chance of permanent hearing loss.

I had the same issue, after like 4 days it turns  out to be pressure difference between the ear and the environment. I was also sick, maybe my ear was infected and it cleared itself

Could be a round window fistula

Sudden hearing loss like this should be seen as soon as possible by a dr. According to many credible medical sites  (NIH in the UK, Harvard medical and Mayo clinic in the US) you have about a10-14 day window to address this (assuming it continues) without at least some permanent hearing loss resulting. The longer you delay, the more likely so e or all hearing loss will be unrecoverable.",2025-10-22 17:04:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ode1rg/sudden_hearing_loss_after_blowing_my_nose_anyone/
1oddo6v,hardofhearing,Any tips???,"So for the past month my hearing has been deteriorating and I have been struggling to hear people a lot. For context I work in a very busy cafe/bakery and there are voices constantly which is quite annoying for me. I was wondering if people had any tips to help keep my focus on what people are saying to me. I want to try lip reading but I’m not able to in my job as I have to look at a bunch of screens while people are talking to me. I already had a complaint from this woman who shouted at me from across the place and I didn’t hear her and when I explained my situation she said “we’ll fix your hearing then” lady if I could I would mate but luckily my boss is so lovely she went over to the woman and asked her not to speak to me like that so I am very thankful for my colleagues and managers. But it is just hard on me aswell as work I also go to school for engineering in an airport so I have alot of noises going on in the workshop which makes it hard to hear people which is a recipe for disaster
I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, I don’t have any resources to get to my closest doctor and my mum won’t drive me 😢😢 that just puts out any hearing aids for me but oh well I think I can manage without them I would just like tips on how to keep focus on people and lip reading!! Thank you 

[댓글]
You need to get a dr. There very little that can be done until you know what your hearing is. Medical help is a right in most countries and not getting a child medical attention is neglect and not legal in most places.



















Furthermore lip reading is not an exact science  and while there are classes for lip reading and sign language if you don’t have the resources to get to the dr i don’t see how you would get to lip reading classes.

Agreed, find a way to get a hearing test whether it be someone driving you or an uber. You can try to work on auditory training to hear in the presence of background noise, such as listening to an audiobook while they’re another source of sound like a tv show on to try to train your brain to filter out extraneous noise. but ultimately, hearing test is your better move

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Like the others, I urge you to prioritize getting to the doctor as soon as possible, preferably to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist, but in the very least to a primary care physician, understanding that you likely will need to follow up with an ENT. I know it’s difficult to take time off for work for medical appointments, but some hearing loss is treatable. Also, some hearing losses need to be treated as soon as possible for the best chance of recovering hearing. 

Lip reading is a helpful context clue for understanding what’s been said, but it’s more an aid than a solution, as many words look similar (e.g., “I love you” and “olive juice”). There are live closed captioning apps (system accessibility settings, apps like Live Transcribe) that can assist with in person and telephone communication. 

One difficulty it sounds like you may have is communicating when your vision has to be directed toward screens (unless you can have a transcription program running at the bottom of the screen that detects and transcribes nearby speech). Sighted deaf and hard of hearing individuals often are highly dependent upon their vision for communication, and adapting to a newly acquired hearing loss takes considerable visual cuing at first. 

Again, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Prioritize your medical treatment, then work on finding the best communication options for you. There may be support services for the deaf and hearing impaired in your area, and it would be good to reach out to them too. 

Best of luck!

[EDIT: Wanted to add that hearing aids can be life changing for some people experiencing hearing loss that can be remediated. You should definitely try them if given the opportunity. They might be the best solution for you. However, do keep in mind that noisy environments create challenges no matter what solution you’re using.]",2025-10-22 16:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oddo6v/any_tips/
1od9ibm,hardofhearing,Phonak Roger One rant,"My wife got me a Roger One a couple years ago - it's an extremely fancy remote mic. It works pretty well, but the construction is *shoddy*. After two years of light use, the power switch broke so I can't turn it *off*. I didn't drop it, it didn't get wet, it just...stopped working. Phonak is charging $200 to fix something that cost $2000 new.

Having a remote mic is nice but the construction quality is inexcusable for something this pricy.

[댓글]
If it happened to you, it probably happened to others too.  Complain to the business you purchased it from and to Phonak.  If they do not provide a suitable solution, post here again so others know to avoid it.  I couldn't afford it when I  tried it a few years ago and certainly would not consider it again if they cannot support it properly, it's definitely an expensive accessory .

That's ridiculous. You'd think something that expensive would last more than two years. Maybe see if CS will do a goodwill repair but if not, there are better-built options for way less. My MIL's audien ion pro aids cost under $600 and have survived daily wear and tear no problem.

This was my feedback to them when they invited me to a Roger users focus group. The difference between the Roger Table Mic and Table Mic 2 is astounding. The first generation for me is still going strong, battery lasts ages but the Table Mic 2, after just 2 years, I have 1 (out of 4) that no longer takes charge. 

Knowing Phonak, it is planned obsolescence. If your device breaks within the 2 first years though, they just replace it. Had this happen with a Roger Pen and a Roger On.

Please DM me with details of your Roger.  I may have one for sale, and am happy to negotiate.",2025-10-22 14:16:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1od9ibm/phonak_roger_one_rant/

You can demo the Shokz at places like Best Buy or Sam's. One ear has a lot of distortion and I do a little better with them compared to open ear headphones.

1oabq2k,hardofhearing,The idea of a device that allows you to feel orchestral music through vibrations,"Hello everyone! I'm a sound engineer, and I want to make classical music concerts more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing.

The idea: a device called ""Touchestra"" — a small board that represents an orchestra map, divided into sections (percussion, strings, woodwinds, brass, etc.). When a section starts playing, its corresponding sector lights up and begins vibrating at its own unique frequency.

And before I proceed with any further work, I need your feedback!!

1. Would something like this even be in demand? Could it help deaf individuals get closer to the music of a symphony orchestra?
2. Do you attend classical music concerts? If yes/no — why?
3. Will different vibration frequencies be perceptible at all?
4. What inclusion options have you seen in practice, or have you simply thought about?

I welcome any and all answers; it's important for me to see opinion from my target audience. It's better for me to understand if it's needed now than to create something that finds no application.
Thank you very much in advance

The problem is orchestra. You can pull that off for like 3 instruments. 4 gets to be a lot. 

There's no way to parse out an orchestra. Would be too much to make sense of. Maybe a board thing like for sports, but I don't see the appeal.

Watch Mr. Holland's Opus for how to make music accessible to deaf people.

A new way to be accessible! I have a friend who built a platform that vibrates to the base of music. I like it a lot even though I feel the base (he doesn't). I've told him he needs to build something for people like me who have lost the high frequencies. He hasn't had the time. He's making music accessible in other ways now.

Edit: I've the the same question worded differently and as I'm new to this I didn't know that it was pretty important, but should have realized that it is: the model I believe is rexton reach r-li t, it things that go in the ears are custom fitted. All of this has been done through public healthcare (Denmark) so I don't know that much but at least I think the fit is to standard but would most likely have been even better done in the private sector. Finally I've never heard the sound when his ears are covered all though that doesn't happen often, I've only heard it when he is messing with the software settings on his app and he never adjust anything sound wise on hearing aid themselves. Thank you for all the curious questions and suggestions to far


I’m reaching out as a victim of my father’s recently prescribed hearing aids, hoping that someone here or maybe a relative of a hard of hearing person can answer my question.

So, he got these hearing aids that he *does* need. They’re fairly ""modern"", which means they come with a lovely little app that lets him adjust the volume, sensitivity, and all sorts of other settings.

Here’s my problem—and the reason I feel like a victim of them:  
Why the F@$# do they have to make a horrendous sound every single time he makes even a single microadjustment?!

Why does it have to sound like a thousand grasshoppers screeching right next to my ear, in a tone so high that any not hard of hearing person above the age 40 probably can’t even hear it?  
Why does my hearing have to suffer just because he’s tweaking his hearing aids through some app?!

Please, I need this explained. I'm losing my mind 

—A 24-year-old victim of his father’s hearing aids

  
P.S**.** He’s a 61-year-old fiddler, so he loves to adjust the app often, also when I’m visiting, forgetfull of (having commented on the horrendous sound) and obviously unable to hear the sound currently MESSING WITH MY MIND. I feel so alone in my suffering, being an only child and thus the only one in relative nearness to him WHO IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO HEAR IT.

[댓글]
Please mention the make &amp; model number of the hearing-aids he has, as this enables pinpoint research of the issue, whether it's limited to just this model, or across different makes etc

They shouldn't be making any sound if they are in his ear. If there is feedback happening while he's wearing them, they are not fit correctly and he should return to his audiologist for an adjustment. (Or he is doing something like cupping his ear).

Feedback.  It’s a speaker and a microphone very close together.  If it gets covered at all, the sound coming from the speaker bounces back into the microphone.  It’s the same as when you hold a microphone up to its speaker on a stage.  Or when two people have their mics on in the same room on a zoom call.

When I was first dating, it was a fun proximity alert for how close my boyfriend and I were dancing lol.

They can sometimes be adjusted to not have so much feedback, but they are limited by how much amplification is needed for the patient.

When my grandmother got older, she couldn’t hear the squealing, so she’d sit there with it low level squealing until someone told her to fix it.

Sounds like a poor fitting process from the audiologist. What you hear is called feedback, and you will also hear it when hugging him or when something covers the microphone. Basically, it’s sound leaking from the speaker to the microphone and creates an unintended feedback loop causing the squeaking sound. 

Modern hearing aids are pretty good at minimizing feedback. However, it is important that sound doesn’t leak through the piece in the ear. For mild hearing losses, sometimes domes are good enough. In your case I’d make sure your father doesn’t use domes, but custom made ear molds. The sound actually becomes better with well fitted ear molds.

Go back to the audiologist and discuss the problem.

Also, a more important thing is that you need to understand that your father still have hearing loss. Hearing aids don’t really solve anything. Yes, they amplify the right frequencies so that we can hear them, but they cannot make the sound any clearer. This means that they help in quiet environments at short distances to the speaker, if people speak clearly and you see the speaker clearly. It’s up to you to change your view on communication. Never speak from a different room, make sure lighting and listening conditions are good. It’s fatiguing to listen even with hearing aids, since the cognition is used to just identifying and processing sounds, instead of being available for information processing. Keep that in mind, and always be flexible to make communication easy and less dependent on listening.

So it only makes the feedback sound when he's adjusting it? He's not bringing his hands anywhere near his hearing-aid when adjusting the settings? If he is, then the cupping effect will cause feedback. If he's not, then there's an issue with the hearing-aids and/or app that needs to be reported to the manufacturer/provider of the devices.

In my experience this kind of feedback comes from either handling or touching the hearing aids, a poor fit (perhaps the domes are too big or small) or a buildup of earwax. 

I’ve also had this problem to a degree when I need a haircut and my hair touches the aids.

Are his hearing aids custom aids? There’s a manufacturer that does programme and volume changes to the custom aids by making the phone emit a specific pattern of high frequency chirp. The aids “hear” this sound and execute the change in volume. This is to get around the fact that not all customs have a Bluetooth receiver, so as to make the aids smaller.

I also get a short beeping sound when I switch my program setting for both my hearing aid and my processor, unless the batteries are low.

my hearing aids do this too with any little adjustment and even to me the sounds Is so high screeching and annoying idk why it does that maybe you can turn it off ?

Oh lord. 

FEEDBACK. 

It isn’t just your worst nightmare, imagine being HIM. yeah. He hears it too. 
Also imagine the single most annoying jingle you’ve ever heard. Got it? Yeah? Now imagine having to hear that jingle play every single time you put your hearing aids on because that is the very thing that you hear when you turn your hearing aids on that jingle is what is programmed into the hearing aid as the start up to you that the hearing aids are on every single time you want to hear you start your day to the most annoying sound you have ever heard yes yes that’s what you have to look forward to as you get older and you start to lose your hearing. It’s inevitable because everybody starts to lose their hearing. It’s a biological evolutionary process.

I was born with severe nerve darkness, bilateral both ears diagnosed at 18 months. The doctors told my parents I would never learn to hear. I would never learn to communicate. I would never understand sound at 18 months old. I was with hearing aids in both ears and started intense. Speech therapy I went four days a week for three hours, one day, four hours the next day, alternating on the last day of the week until I was 4 1/2 years old, my speech is absolutely perfect to the point that doctors do not believe that I was born without language never had language never had hearing. I went into profound deafness in my late 30s and could no longer use hearing aids. I got a implant in 2022 and it is the best thing that has ever happened. Hearing aids are horrible horrible horrible I cannot recommend hearing aids to anyone. All they do is amplify sounds they give you feedback they are just awful. They are awful if I have been able to get a cochlear implant much earlier in life I would have done so that difference between the two is  astronomical; hearing aids are absolutely worthless and this is coming from a person that has had lifelong hearing loss. I have never experienced life any other way and I am telling you hearing aids are just horrible.",2025-10-18 18:03:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1oa2nue/a_victim_of_my_fathers_hearing_aids/

That’s really a discussion for you and your audiologist. I’m not a specialist but in my unprofessional opinion I imagine there would be some improvement if you had hearing aids.

Do you feel like your quality of life is affected? That's the main thing. Also you may not realize how much your missing till you try them out. Go chat with an audiologist and see what they recommend.

This looks like you could benefit from hearing aids but like fallspector says, talk to a professional.

Blue is usually the left ear and red is the right. I’m pretty sure that’s universal but happy to be corrected. I’ve had HAs for years and the colour has always been Red-right and Blue-left.

I bet hearing aids would help. They aren't hearing miracles but they would make a difference. My life is easier with them than without them. I have workarounds for hearing limits and that makes a difference too.

I have only around 40 decibels loss as of a few years ago, like others said, you need to ask your audiologist. 

But one time I got tested at Costco and they gave me hearing aids to try while I shop, I was blown away at everything I was missing. Unfortunately for me, every audiologist recommends I have many channels and the cheapest was like $5k-$6k pre-pandemic. I have congenital and acquired hearing loss and they call it ""cookie bite"" because my audiogram looks like a big semicircle, like someone bit it. That's why I need many channels to have more adjustability.

You could test some and see what it is like.

Looks a little like mine from memory and I can't hear shit

Someone’s already said it but talk to your audiologist

We are not doctors - talk to an audiologist

It depends on your hearing. A test from an audiologist is the best way to know. Hearing aids help some people, but aren’t always needed.

As an audiologist, yes

Seems like it’s worth an exploration into hearing aids",2025-10-16 14:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o87msa/do_i_need_hearing_aids/

Your questions aren’t useful at all, I’m afraid. I don’t think you understand what it is like to live with deafness or hearing loss. You need to read up on that. 

* Accommodations such as interpreters, CART, external microphones and so on should be available in a class. If someone can’t volunteer in class, it’s not solved by design, but by assuring better accommodations and understanding of how to structure the communication. (Read about Nyle DiMarcos school experience in Deaf Utopia, for example.) The inclusion in schools is a much bigger problem than design.

* Install hearing loops and ensure hearing aids have a t-tool.

* Make information and communication visible.

Research the potential accoustics...type of floor, walls, etc. I would prefer a room with excellent acoustics to any design.",2025-10-16 12:57:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o85gbd/please_help_with_my_uni_assignment/

1o6owmt,hardofhearing,Hearing test results and hearing aids at 27,"Hi! I just wanted to get on here and see if anyone had a similar “story” and test results! 

I, and all my friends, noticed my lack of hearing around 16 yrs old. Since then it has been a constant conversation through school, meeting my husband, and at work. Well, 10+ years later I finally go take a hearing test. I was SHOCKED when the audiologist recommended two hearing aids. Just wondering if anyone has a similar “cookie bite” and if you have noticed any more decreases throughout the years. 

I understand that since this is genetic, I really can’t base anything off of others experiences. But purely curious! 

Thanks in advance!

Cookie bite here, similar story as you.  In my late teens people kept telling me to go get the wax cleaned out of my ears and whatnot, heh.  I knew it was there, my wife and I joked that I was the eyes and she was the ears, but I didn't deal with it until 45 years old and it was really affecting both my work and personal life.  I did feel like it was getting worse. 

Hearing aids have been life-changing, I really didn't even realize just how much of the world I was missing.

I have cookie bite loss, I don’t know how much loss there’s really been aside from the typical slight loss in the 8k range, which for me is still above average (?!). My hearing loss was first suspected in second grade, but my parents never really followed through about it until I was 17 and got a pair of hearing aids that really worked for me. They help so much because I always say “I wasn’t meant to hear people”, as my loss is focused similarly around where most speech falls. The difference with them in and out is day and night. At home it doesn’t matter so much, but being able to function at work and having conversations is so worth having hearing aids for. If you can get a pair, I think you’ll find them worth it. I found myself much less exhausted because I wasn’t trying so hard to hear all of the time.

Oh wow, yours is like perfect cookie bite. I have that as well, i had hearing aids in elementary school, hated them and quit by third grade, tried again in high school, gave up within a year. In my early 30s i finally admitted i was struggling more, and got another hearing test done. My cookie bite is now a cookie bit, the ends have evened out to a pretty steady across the board loss with a smaller dip in the middle, but the upside is hearing aid technology is wayyy better!

Welcome to the club buddy! I’ve had cookie bite as a teen and my chart is a little more C shaped but about the same :)

I don’t have a deaf community I’m ingrained in or have a job that can accommodate me easily (I’m a teacher) so HA it is and it’s been a life changer for me to be able to work in the hearing world.

Mine looks almost exactly like yours but more symmetrical. I have noticed a bit of a decline since I started wearing aids and have had them modified a bit. I didn’t start wearing them until about 5 years ago (37) but probably needed them in my 20s. I haven’t figured out which side of my family the hearing loss is from. I really benefitted from aids in conversations. Good luck!

Cookie bite here. Mine has been steady for about 15 years.

TIL of cookie bite hearing loss! I thought it was so weird you had loss in the middle frequencies instead of high like most.

Just curious from the professionals, who is able to adapt better to understanding speech with hearing aids?  Those with a cookie bite loss or those with high frequency loss?  I'm observing the comments about how much hearing aids helped the cookie bites. I'm a high frequency loss person but it's still a struggle even with the aids in both ears. So, just wondering what the professionals say?

33. Also cookie bite. Had hearing issues my whole life and got hearing aids just over a month ago. It’s been a huge improvement in my day to day.

Basically same story (34f) - sister kinda always knew, then high school it was fairly obvious/a joke that I was deaf. There were a lot of signs in my 20s, e.g wondered why phones never turned up to an understandable volume 😂, starting to need subtitles for the tv. 

It was shockingly apparent at the start of COVID-19. Couldn’t hear a word through the masks🫠 got hearing tests and the technician was so confused “normally the line goes straight up that way or  that way if it’s not perfect… 👀” (went to proper audiologist and ENT soon after). 

Been using hearing aids for a few years now. They work pretty good, but still more hard of hearing than everyone else with them in. Thanks for sharing",2025-10-14 19:18:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o6owmt/hearing_test_results_and_hearing_aids_at_27/
1o653ju,hardofhearing,"For my fellow HoH Android users - I made a free app like Live Transcribe, but with the 'Save' button we always needed.","Hey everyone,

Like many of you folks, I'm Hard of Hearing. While I think Google's Live Transcribe is a fantastic tool, I always got frustrated by one thing: I couldn't save the transcript. It was useless for practical things like taking down my mother's grocery list, because the text would disappear as soon as I closed the app.

I've seen this sentiment shared here before, and I was especially inspired to finish this up after seeing the great app a developer made for his HoH partner on iOS last month. I wanted to make sure us Android users had a great option, too. 

So, I built Transcriboar. It's live now and it's 100% free.

Link to Transcriboar on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neonsnake.transcriboar

Think of it as Live Transcribe, but with all the features we need to actually use the text later:

* Save transcripts to your phone
* Edit and Rename saved files
* Share the text with other apps
* Print directly

And, of course, a cool boar logo, which was a significant feature I felt Live Transcribe also lacked.

Most importantly, it's truly free and private. Everything is stored locally on your device. There is no cloud, no data recording, and no expensive AI subscription. I used the same fast, free, and reliable API that Google already provides.

Please be kind, I'm just one guy who built this in his kitchen. I wasn't compensated and I don't make any money from this. I just wanted to build something that would genuinely help me and, hopefully, others in our community.

Thanks for checking it out.

P.S. / Important Info:

* Privacy Policy: https://neonsnake.com/privacy.html
* More Info: https://neonsnake.com/transcriboar.html
* Availability Note: Currently, the app is live in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. I'm working to expand this to many more countries very soon

[댓글]
You are an amazing one guy who built this in your kitchen. Maybe the best

Thank you so much.  Transcription was so critical during my husband illness and it was frustrating not to be able to have the conversion to refer back to. 
I just downloaded the app and will try it out tomorrow.

this is an excellent initiative and an example of your brilliance!

Hello! It's not available in my country (Malaysia) yet but I just wanted to say a HUGE THANK YOU for putting in the time and your expertise to build this app. I saw the same post last month on the iOS app and totally wished someone would do the same for us Android users haha...
But truly, life already can be so challenging and it's kind &amp; giving people like you who make such a difference in our HoH community.

FYI just pushed an update to the play store for the Android 11 folks, should be out (hopefully) by tomorrow-ish.

* Fixed Transcription on Android 11 devices, works reliably on tested devices
* Resolved an issue that prevented the microphone from starting on certain Android 11 phones.
* Minor Performance improvements and bug fixes

Thanks for all the patience and feedback!

Is it possible to make Transcriboar available outside of Google Playstore?",2025-10-14 03:40:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o653ju/for_my_fellow_hoh_android_users_i_made_a_free_app/

1o5trpx,hardofhearing,Living with reverse-slope hearing loss: worried about progression!,"Hey people!

I (28M) was diagnosed with RSHL (reverse slope hearing loss) about six years ago. My ENT identified a genetic factor as the main cause, and I got fitted with hearing aids right away. They've made a huge difference in my daily life, honestly, I can't imagine getting by without them.

I just had my yearly checkup today, and when we compared my recent audiogram to the one from four years ago, it showed a 15 dB drop in both ears. That was a bit unsettling to see. 

I'm wondering if anyone here has RSHL or a similar type of progressive genetic hearing loss. Have you noticed your hearing changing significantly over time? Is gradual decline something that tends to happen with this type of loss, or can it sometimes stabilise?

I know everyone's hearing journey is different, but I'd really appreciate hearing about your experiences. It's been on my mind a lot today, especially thinking of what things might look like in 15 years down the line if the rate of decline stays the same. 

Thanks for taking the time to read!!

I’m a grad student at Northwestern studying design, and my thesis focuses on how hearing parents learn to communicate and connect after finding out their child is deaf or hard of hearing.

I came across a few stories online that really stayed with me, and I wanted to understand more about what that experience is like from those who’ve lived it, whether as someone HoH or Deaf, a parent, or a teacher or interpreter who’s supported families in that stage.

I’m hoping to learn from real experiences, not to design *for* anyone, but to better understand what helps parents and kids connect and what makes that process harder. I know it’s a deeply personal topic, and I want to approach it with care and respect.

If you’re open to sharing, I’d be so grateful to hear your thoughts here or privately by DM if that feels more comfortable. Either way, thank you for taking the time to read this and for creating such a welcoming community.

I don’t really see where the design come in, since connection is about the human to human communication.

I know it’s uncomfortable to do, but asking the speaker to use a microphone and use it correctly is valid. It’s will probably help others who are having a hard time hearing too.

1o4qt3o,hardofhearing,I am a HOH teacher - are there any support groups for HOH/deaf educators?,"I am a first year educator with a hearing disability. I teach hearing students. I am having trouble policing talking as I can struggle to hear what exactly was said, who said it, and where the voice was coming from. I have talked to students about it. I am not seeing the changes I hoped for. Does anyone know of groups for teachers with disabilities that I could maybe join for support? A quick internet search has let me down - I don't seem to be able to find anything.

  


[댓글]
I don't know of any groups for HOH teachers, but I will share my experiences in the classroom as a HOH teacher. This seems more like a classroom management problem more than a HOH problem. The better your classroom management is, the less ""talking"" you are going to have to contend with. This isn't to say that ***you*** are doing things the wrong way, just that there are small changes that you can make to lessen the talking going on in your classroom.

* Set the expectations by enforcing noise levels. In my school we use the 3-0 scale. 3 is recess/assembly level, 2 is general talking/hallway levels, 1 is whisper (can only be heard by the person next to you), and 0 is no talking/noise at all. When we are in the classroom, the expectation is that noise levels do not raise above 1. Holding up a 0 or 1 is the signal for students to mirror your gesture and bring it down to that level. Hold up the 0 or 1 until all students have theirs raised.
* Use prompts like ""If you can hear the sound of my voice, clap once/clap twice"" at a low level and increase claps until the room is silent, or hold up your hand and count down from 5. At 1 the class should be silent. These work well with Proximity or the use of a microphone. Walk around the room so you know students can hear you in all parts of the room without the need to raise your voice.
* Reiterate these expectations every time you use these prompts, and be consistent. These are strategies that work at all grade levels. Also reiterate the expectation when you release students for individual or group work. ""We will be working in groups/individually. The expectation during this time is that the noise level will remain at a 1/0.""
* Proximity is a great way to get students to focus. If students are being too loud, go stand next to/over them. They quiet down pretty quickly when they have their teacher standing within inches of them. However if you are sitting at your desk or helping a student across the classroom, they are more likely to be talking loudly or goofing off.
* Use a microphone in the classroom hooked up to the classroom speakers or a bluetooth speaker while you are giving instruction. While it won't directly stop the talking going on during the lesson/lecture portion of your instruction, it will lessen it because now they are contending with the volume of your voice drowning out their own whispering.
* Keep students busy. If they are talking, this means they either don't have any work (they finished early), or the work they do have isn't mentally stimulating them enough to where they have to focus to complete the assignment. Additionally, set a time limit (with visual timers) for work you assign that is tight enough that students who aren't focusing will not be able to complete it in time.

Here is a good resource that has helped me improve my classroom management skills. It is a good read, and will only take an hour or 2 to read it: [https://archive.org/details/fredjonestoolsfo0000fred/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/fredjonestoolsfo0000fred/mode/2up)

You can read the entire book as long as you have a login for the site (just check the book out at the top.)

I would also recommend posting this in r/Teachers if you haven't already so you can get some advice from more seasoned teachers in the field.

I wish I could join a support club with you. I have exactly the same classroom management struggles.

i work in a deaf school so im not sure, but maybe assign a classroom job of “noise monitor”?

I’m a deaf (but use ha) teacher of high school age hearing students. A decade in, I’m over trying to police what they say. If they can say it where I don’t hear them then  it’s not my problem. They know I’m deaf and if they need me I have to see them and see their mouths. They learn quickly how to interact with me

I am a Deaf educator. I have a hearing TA but. I work in a school for the Deaf. My students are very helpful for figuring who or where noises came from if they saw or heard it too. 

I am sure there are a couple of others on here and r/deaf. Maybe I could create a facebook group.

I would love to join a group. I find this a struggle and I have a co-teacher who is hearing. It’s frustrating because I can’t hear them and I feel like they think I’m ignoring the students when we should be completely silent.

I used to teach High School to hearing students. It was a chore to police the use of cell phones since I am high frequency deaf. The students cought on that I did not hear the rings. Ugh. I just couldn't and ended up quitting. I hope it gets better and easier for you.

I am HoH and teach hearing University students. When they gave me a teaching role I was very clear that the struggle would be real, and they assured me I would be fine and then I wasn't. And on top of it I lost even more hearing towards the end of my first semester of teaching. Our disability services team couldn't link me up with any other HoH educators. The University has now put supports in place for me, like giving me much more lead in time to prepare, and becoming ok with me taking all of my tech everywhere.

my issues in the past were that the background noise would be amplified, and mask any high frequency speech sounds that i could already hear making it harder to hear with the hearing aids on. 

i was curious how tech has changed in the last 10 years. are hearing aids beneficial to you?

[댓글]
Been wearing hearing aids since I was a toddler. Audiologists have this mindset of only following your audiogram, but you have the right to tell them that it’s not your preference and you need the sound brought forward or the speech levels need to be amplified, whatever. 

Trust me. I have had multiple confrontations with audiologists over the years over this. They need reminding that YOU are the user and what you need goes. Don’t be afraid to push back as hard as you need to. 

Other than that, I’ve been told hearing aid tech has improved immensely but I’m not sure how, other than we have bluetooth and rechargeable battery capabilities now. The downside is the programming tracks the frequency and length of the wearing period which gets me scolded because I never wear them alone, which is 99% of the time.

Anyway, find your IDGAF energy and an audiologist you like and get fitted. Lol. Happy wearing! :)

I had reverse slope hearing loss, though it's leveled off and is pretty flat these days, so take it with a grain of salt. That said, couple things:

1. It took time for my ears to adjust to the new sounds. Keyboard presses sounded like gunshots, the air conditioner was deafening. I got used to it only after wearing my HAs all day for several weeks straight - your brain has to adapt.
2. It took several rounds of programming to dial in the right settings. I visited my audiologist monthly or even twice a month for the first 6 months or so, then every three months after that for a couple years. It's amazing how much of a difference tuning makes.",2025-10-11 21:30:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o47dz3/reverse_slope_low_frequency_loss_and_hearing_aids/

Deaf people are already less likely to get into an auto crash. Maybe you could look o to accessibility devices to help hearing people drive better.

You don’t really need hearing to drive. In fact, one of the biggest prejudices there are about the Deaf community is that we can’t drive. I have personally participated in research that showed that we HoH and Deaf drive **more** safely than average, because of paying visual attention to the traffic better, for example a more consistent and appropriate use of rear mirrors, and so on. Your project therefore doesn’t really solve a problem, but rather contributes to cementing misconceptions.

Note, we don’t really need to communicate using speech when driving, we don’t need to hear what people say and we aren’t socially excluded when driving.

I’d recommend doing much more research before starting a project.

I went to the other post on the other thread that you shared and some of the comments were fantastic, advising you to find a lawyer and explaining step by step how much of an ADA violation this is as well as workplace retaliation and discrimination. Those are awesome. 

As a hard of hearing person, I am curious if they have provided any kind of accommodations in your classroom that may help? I am thinking... mirrors above the board and on the side of the board so you can see if a student is raising their hand when you're writing something. 

A strict policy of hand raising since you cannot follow random comments. 

I'm wondering if you would be allowed to have your phone on you and do speech to text when an incident is happening so you can have a transcript of what is said? Obviously, you will not be able to stare at your phone to keep up during the incident, but It can help when filing an incident report.   
  
I'm trying to think creatively. Obviously you won't get any fancy accommodations from admin who don't understand the nature of hearing loss. I'm just honestly stunned that a SCHOOL wouldn't provide... accommodations even for a teacher. That's wild to me. Do they have a disability services office? That's my own curious question.

Check with your states agency for deaf and hard of hearing for a caption device or phone. 

Check with your fire department for smoke alarms that flash a light.

Reading a message can be challenging too, depending on their ability to process/ read quickly. Some apps retain the written msg for review. Im using CaptionCall for calls, and a transcription app for irt meetings.

Caption Call is free

Innocaption is free for deaf/ hoh 
I think you might have to enter your  SSN to register. I forgot.  Its decent sometimes hit or miss

For face to face conversations in quiet environments, the captions built into any phones accessibility menu should be good enough. Paid services like otter.ai are more accurate. 

Is this a situation where they just need a little help or do they need adult care services? In the US, they can use IP relays, VRS (if they sign), or InnoCaption free of charge to make phone calls. Having adult children in the area does not mean they are capable of living on their own.

Android or IoS?

Android use live transcribe. I have an app that's basically an improved version of that hopefully in a few days or whenever the play store approves it, too.

I was hoping this test would confirm otosclerosis so I could get stapes surgery but now I have no idea what next steps could be. 

  
IMPRESSION: 



1. Findings suggestive of right greater than left fenestral otospongiosis. 



2. Dehiscence of the left semicircular canal. Recommend correlation for a third window syndrome.

I’d get some of that advanced testing at this point.

Go to an ENT, see a neurotologist.

See a Otologists  And a Neurologist.

My guess is that that of those results the first one does involve otosclerosis. Only reason I know this is because I recently had a CT scan, and I was formally diagnosed with otosclerosis.

1o0xjgf,hardofhearing,Hearing Aids Best for Heavy Sweating?,"I am going in for a hearing aid fitting/evaluation in a couple weeks to get a new pair. I had the fancy starkeys with all the Bluetooth this and this that for about 5 years and I HATE THEM. 

This time around I want some that are absolutely NOT Bluetooth capable and do not have *any* phone connectivity and are made for people who work outside and sweat, etc a LOT.

Are there any particular ones I should be looking at and thinking about? 

[댓글]
Talk to your audiologist about that. And for hearing aids to not be connected is totally fine. your audiologist will knkw how to help for both of those concerns. Fyi

You don't need to use the Bluetooth feature. Definitely not ReSound. Phonak managed sweat better.

Some of them are waterproof, or at least rated water resistant.

When I was a kid I think sweat did in one of my BTE aids.  More recently, my old Phonak would sometimes shut off when I got very sweaty but they'd turn back on when they dried out.

My current ones (Oticon) seem completely resistant to it.  I work a job where I'm sometimes very sweaty and they're basically sitting in pools of salt water for hours behind my ears and they're fine.  I wear them at the gym, too.

I used to worry about it but I decided to just not worry about it.  They're under a fairly comprehensive warranty.

Absolutely no phone connectivity may be a tough ask.  Almost all hearing aids have a T-coil receiver even if they don't have Bluetooth.  And almost all have Bluetooth, too, these days.

This is one of the reasons I went with in the ear. They are naturally protected from sweat and don't bounce around when I'm working out. Not an option for everyone, but I greatly prefer them.

My audiologist actually said Bluetooth options tend to be more waterproof because they don’t have any access points to the battery like the ones with a physical battery do.

Ooooh so you’re switching to rechargeable?

I switched from Signia to Phonak, and I LOVE them. Withstand heavy workouts much better than Signia. You will still have to give them maintenance though and more often because of the sweat. There's truly no brands out there that are sweat proof.",2025-10-08 01:33:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0xjgf/hearing_aids_best_for_heavy_sweating/
1o0weh8,hardofhearing,Tympanoplasty recovery question,"I had a tympanoplasty almost 4 months ago, but I’m still struggling with my hearing in that ear and wanted to see if anybody else has a similar experience. At my 10 week follow up, the doctor said that the eardrum looks healed and the hole is closed, but there was still some residual packing behind my eardrum that needed to dissolve. He said it could take 12 weeks from the surgery date for my hearing to be normal, but I’m at about 15 weeks now and I’m still hearing a lot of internal noise when I open/close my jaw. My voice also sounds really loud in that ear when I talk. I have a hearing test scheduled in a few weeks, but I’m starting to panic since I haven’t noticed any improvement in the last month. Has anyone else experienced this, and did it resolve? Thanks!

1o0s3dc,hardofhearing,New Signia hearing aids making me crazy! 😵‍💫,"I just got hearing aids for the first time. The left one, that is. I’ve always semi joked that my left ear canal was deformed because I could never get regular in-ear speakers (can’t remember actual name) to fit.

This left one will not seat properly. We’ve tried a large dome, a smaller dome, and the one you see in the picture. It’s always loosening in my ear canal, especially when I’m eating. It’s making me just crazy!!! The right ear is seated just right and doesn’t loosen at all. I need to go back to the hearing center. But first, what are your thoughts?

[댓글]
My ears are so tiny internally that they used the kids dome from a different set. Look into it!

Why not get the custom earmolds? They'll be exact to your ear canal that way

I got custom made molds. I could not stand the domes. My hearing aids are receiver in the ear too.

Maybe you and your audiologist can look into Grip Tips? I know Oticon makes a few sizes and maybe they would fit on your Signia hearing aids? I was having so many fit issues this year with my new hearing aids and this is what I landed on. They’re kind of an in-between of domes and custom ear molds. They’re almost sticky feeling and as they warm up in your ear they really grip on and don’t move around like domes do.

Molds are the way to go, as long as it's an option with that style receiver. I had a trial pair one time with domes, they would pull off the receiver and get stuck in my ear all the time. I would use this tiny pair of eyeglasses tweezers to fish them out of my ears.

I’m somewhat like that with my right. It won’t seal. I have tiny ear canals and get wax plugs easily

Audiologist here. If you were my patient I'd add a retention tail. When my patients are between sizes I go with the larger size and cut 1 or 2 slits in it to make it ""tulip"" and then you've made a dome that's between sizes. If none of that worked, we'd be talking about custom molds.

Depending on your insurance custom ear molds might be the answer for you. My ears are tiny as well and the only thing that worked for me are custom ear molds. The feedback went away when I got them.

For years my domes slipped out and I didn’t know any better.  I was told there was one size larger they could use.  When it first went inside t was a bit uncomfortable and took me about a week to get used to it.  But I now don’t have them coming out anymore.  Maybe if the kid ones don’t help you you could try this.

I suggest custom earmolds. Because they'll be custom-made to your ear, you won't have any problems.",2025-10-07 21:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0s3dc/new_signia_hearing_aids_making_me_crazy/
1o0loz4,hardofhearing,Lipreading and Auditory Training,"In 1950s, more rehabilitation was offered for hearing loss through the VA. It not only included hearing aids but auditory training and lipreading practices. In the 70s, that fell by the wayside and the focus became more about hearing technology. By the 90s, lipreading just about disappeared.

I've had hearing loss since the mid 80s and got my first pair of hearing aids in the early 90s. Back then, it was analog hearing aids and boy did I struggle with them. What I didn't know at the time was that hearing aids didn't fix my kind of hearing loss. I also didn't know about hearing aid limits back then so background noise continued to be a huge problem in my work environment. I had coworkers say things like, ""Are your ears on,"" when I couldn't understand them. Or the hated, ""Turn up your hearing aids!"" During those years, I thought something was wrong with me. 

Hearing aid limits: They work best within 6 feet. Even though they are better than ever (I love my digital hearing aids over those old analogs), it still interferers. Harsh acoustics with reverberation also impact the usefulness of hearing aids. I didn't learn that until after 17 years of hearing aid use. If I had known, I could created workarounds way back in the 90s. 

After a big drop in hearing going into the severe range (high frequency hearing loss), I had to learn to communicate all over again. I also lost my career at this point because I couldn't cope in noisy environments and there weren't as many accommodations as there are today.  

After two years of feeling like I was in a hole, I did climb out with persistence and determination. I started to teach lipreading for the D/HH state agency, among other hearing loss related classes. I found lipreading to be most helpful because it taught me how to advocate for myself and evaluate communication situations. Now I teach for [Hearing Loss LIVE!](https://hearinglosslive.com/lipreading-classes/) and I have a class this Saturday for the strategies that go with lipreading. Strategies are must because 60 to 70 percent of speech is NOT visible. We need workarounds. Lip shapes are only one of the tools of lipreading and I can teach the visible shapes too, with a class on Oct 25th.

Lipreading aside, auditory training is important too. Over two years ago, I got my first Bluetooth hearing aids. Wow! After not listening to audio books most of my life, I dipped my toe in with these hearing aids in. At first I kept the [built-in smartphone captions](https://hearinglosslive.com/smartphone-built-in-accessibility-for-hearing-loss/) on to help me with the listening. After enough practice, I was able to let go of the captions. The trick was using my hearing aid app to slide out ambient/environmental noise.  I miss words from time to time but I can usually puzzle it out at some point. After a few years of this, I realized auditory training has improved my comprehension. So there really is something to the full rehabilitation the VA offered many years ago. I highly encourage this practice now with podcasts and audiobooks if you don't already do this. Just make sure the narrators/speakers don't have an accent, they talk one at a time, have a steady pace and no background noise. I'm choosy what I listen to and it helps. 

We don't hear things like this from most hearing professionals. It comes from hardcore personal experience.  Thought I'd share a couple of tips to help. Also, use the [Three Golden Rules](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/) with everyone. That alone helped me a lot year ago when I discovered that made all the difference for me. 



[댓글]
Great points.  I have been avoiding audiobooks but I can see the benefits uf using them.

There is no scientific proof that auditory training helps. Getting use to a CInis a different thing, with hearing aids you simply lack the input.

Lip reading might be ok for emergencies, when other options aren’t available, but I feel you should be advocating for skills that do offer us 100% of what’s said without effort, instead of 30% with a great cognitive effort. Why should we waste our cognition on just listening, instead of using it to actually process the information itself. CART, captioning and sign language provide so much more efficient access to speech, and we deserve it.",2025-10-07 17:43:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0loz4/lipreading_and_auditory_training/
1o0guay,hardofhearing,Do you notice as well people being hard of hearing?,"Hello there, I'm hard of hearing and got my first pair 5 years ago, and since then I did notice some of people I suspect being hoh. Do you notice the same or it's because I got my diag quite early? Here is things I notice in their behavior.

\-They often ask me to repeat.

\-They ""stare me"" like it's being more confortable to hear me due to lip reading (without noticing?)

\-They also speak louder than other people, and when we watch tv, often ask me to higher the sound.

Do you notice this behavior on other people and if so do you speak about hearing loss? A friend of mine decided to test themself to see if their hearing is right.

I feel like before this I did not notice this behavior because I was quite on denial.

Take care of yourself!

Yeah all the time. HoH people often show the same masking techniques. Iykyk

Aye, it's pretty noticable.

I got a lovely new boss a few years ago and I realised she was deaf by the end of her first week, whereas some of our team still have no idea. She couldn't hear anything going on behind her which is the biggest giveaway for me :D We're a good combo. My desk faces into the room so I alert her when someone wants her and in return, she handles accents for me lmao.

I also seem to be able to identify hearing aids at fifty paces. Even just walking down the street, I'll notice if someone walking past has got a hearing aid. I love seeing them! I was the only deaf kid at school and the only deaf adult I knew was my grandad. Now I go to work and there are deaf students and other deaf staff and I don't feel alone any more.

I’ve suspected I may have less than great hearing, because if someone isn’t looking at me I struggle to make out what they are saying, and noticed I didn’t hear as well during covid when people were wearing masks. I also ask people to repeat things, and then smile and nod if I feel like I’ve asked too many times.

Yes, especially if they're a lipreader. I've also noticed the other signs you mentioned.

Same here. They say hearing loss is invisible but to those in the know, we know. I instantly recognize it as I talk to people too.

What does masking mean?

Yeah, I do. I've been wearing mine for 7 years, and somehow found more people with mild hearing loss, thanks to mine.

I've telling my neighbor that her child is HoH for several years. She honestly gets offended.

About three months ago they went to an ENT and audiologist.

He has hearing loss and a speech therapist now. 🥲

Also, I have an employee who I've worked with off and on for over a decade.

About a month ago she found out I was HoH for the first time in a hilarious exchange where she realized how many times she's heard me say ""I can't hear you"". 😆",2025-10-07 14:47:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1o0guay/do_you_notice_as_well_people_being_hard_of_hearing/

1o05eun,hardofhearing,how to explain my hearing to friends/classmates,"Some context to begin with, i struggle with low frequencies rather than high ones, and im on a months long wait list to see an audiologist to figure out how much hearing i have and what type of loss. My GP agrees that i have some level of loss, and that hearing aids may be helpful for me, but i dont know how bad my hearing is nor have access to aids yet. I struggle with conversations even in quiet environments unless the other person is louder, next to me, and facing me, and it has to be just the one person so i can focus on them. I only hear the higher pitched sounds of rain, and even at its heaviest rain is quiet for me. I can only really hear things comfortably when its loud, singular things to focus on, and in a quiet environment.   
I'm not even sure if its a loss at all, as my hearing has always been this way since i was  little, im now 20, but as i was neglected i never saw a doctor from what im aware of. My parents often complained about my ""selective"" hearing, and i have never really been much of an out loud talker from what i now know was social fatigue from being autistic, and listening fatigue making conversations especially difficult and taxing. I also struggle to speak in general as i trip over words, and according to my flatmate i apparently have a lisp and audibly struggle to say letters that i coincidentally also struggle to hear. I was put into a BSL club when i was a kid so i can do basic signs and fingerspelling, but we're not really sure if i was there just because it was available or if i was having visible issues or delays.  
  
I'm now finally in a college course and in a place where i have the energy for it, but im really struggling with communicating with my friends and classmates out loud. Its an art course and the majority of us are autistic/adhd, so when i explain that i cant hear very well or am hard of hearing they tend to go ""oh me too! i struggle to process words, i always go what? whenever someone is repeating what theyve said for me!"". And i get it i really do, but they arent seeming to understand that its not what i mean. And ive already noticed people looking at me funny as i assume ive missed them talking to me, or completely ignored them because ive had to focus on the lecturer speaking. So saying im hard of hearing just isnt explaining enough anymore, but i dont want to have to completely explain my experience just so people finally start speaking up to me. I've thought about saying im d/Deaf, as it has been since i was a child and i would rather use BSL if i had people that knew it, but as we dont know my level of loss yet im not sure im comfortable or right in doing so.   


It's a tough situation for me rn, but i have these classmates for at least this school year and the next, and I may not be seen by audiology until February. I'm also not sure if hearing aids would even be useful if they are offered as i expect i will be very overwhelmed with sound.

[댓글]
Say you're hard of hearing but unfortunately don't have your hearing aids yet, and ask them to speak up/speak to you from the front/whatever helps. Mentioning the aids should make clear that it is indeed a physical problem without you having to explain your whole life?

I do that when I'm too lazy to put mine in (I say I forgot lol) because I didn't expect to talk to people XD

PS: if you have good care they will gradually, and with you in team, adjust the aids so you aren't swamped with sound right away. Well worth it :)

I also struggle with low frequencies, but I didn't lose my hearing until last year. It's been a huge adjustment. I just got my hearing aids in May, but I couldn't hear in September, and now I'm in a PhD program. I'm just super honest with people. 


I worried about people not understanding when I said hard of hearing so I would say, ""hey sorry I'm deaf, I didn't catch that. Can you face me?"" Etc. 


Even if I've told people before and they forget, I just try to remind them and keep it lighthearted. I'm in a lab with loud machines, so I just blame them. I always go. ""Sorry, whenever the centrifuge is running all my hearing aids pick up is the machine, can you repeat that?"" 


Everyone I mention it to it super supportive and understanding. People don't mean to be rude, they just genuinely forget a lot. Especially if you're good at keeping up by lip-reading/hearing aids most of the time.

So I’ve been hard of hearing my whole life. I learned to mask so well in social situations even when I miss parts of conversations.  The best thing to do is be honest and say that you didn’t hear something and ask them to please speak up or face you as they are talking. And I agree with mentioning that you’re in the process of getting aids and you have a really hard time hearing without them. Also since you’re in college have you looked into getting accommodations to help? When you go to the audiologist definitely mention it. They can give you a microphone that the professor wears and it amplifies their voice and helps you not strain your ears so much trying to listen to what they are saying.

I’m 31 and a few years ago had to have a mastoidectomy on both sides to resolve an issue. As a result the hearing loss in both ears was significantly reduced. As of August this year I recently had BAHA surgery. Currently waiting for my switch on to get the hearing aids attached. 

The issue I’m having is that the left bolt has completely slipped out leaving a small hole in my head. I went to A&amp;E over the weekend, got seen by an ENT doctor who has advised that I call my audiologist department that fitted my implants. I’m currently waiting on a call back. 

I’m just curious has anyone that has had a BAHA had the bolt slip out before? I’ve followed all instructions. Don’t touch it etc so I’m quite baffled at how it has just quite literally slipped out. My panic is that this will happen again. 

Any advice would be most kindly appreciated and hope you all have a great day!

Hearing aids out.
Loop Experience in. 

Tried a few different earplugs over the years, Loop have been the best for my ears, both for protection and for sound clarity.

My work gave me custom high end earplugs (they retail for about 1K CAD - I work in a very noisy environment), so I'd  bring those. They have a perfect  fit for my ears and bring all noise down to about 70dB without  distorting the sound quality.  I am really sensitive to loud noises after my work accident that caused my hearing loss, so before I got these earplugs at my new place of work, I actually didn't like live music anymore because  why would  I pay money to be in pain for hours?

I'm also attending a concert soon and debating whether to use my hearing aids or just use my loop earplugs. 

I wanted to try wearing hearing aids in a concert to maybe hear some notes I couldn't hear before, especially since there's a live band.

Alternatively, are there any over-the-counter or specialized products (something I can order on Amazon, Etsy) that could help address the discomfort I’m experiencing with the domes?

I had single sided deafness for about a decade (and then started losing hearing in my good ear) but I used domes. The mold closed off to much of my natural hearing. But honestly it depends on the type of hearing loss you have. You can also try and see what works best. It's not hard for you audiologist to change them.

I have moderate loss in both ears as well as auditory processing disorder. I’m also autistic so have sensory issues. I didn’t get on with domes. I’ve had a few sets of molds, ranging from hard acrylic to soft silicone. I’m currently wearing soft acrylic as I found the hard ones felt too loose and the silicone ones made my ears sweaty and itchy. I’m in the UK so don’t have the same insurance limitations. I too have looked for over the counter solutions, without success. Good luck!

I've used silicone and acrylic moulds, and power domes.  The domes were the least comfortable.  I only used them while the moulds were being made.  By the end of the day my poor ear canal would just be aching from where it pressed in several spots.  

Where I live molds are usually sold with the hearing aid as part of a package deal through the audiologist but it sounds like hearing aids are provisioned differently where you live.  (Through a doctor?)

My ears won't are meant for those dome. So I have to go to audiologist to get the ear molds done.

I’ve have single sided deafness for 22 years now and have always have had molds! I don’t think I’ll ever use domes- just not for me, and that’s ok! I think it’s worth talking to your audiologist and advocate for the molds if the domes haven’t felt comfortable.",2025-10-04 04:50:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nxky3s/singleside_deafness_new_to_wearing_hearing_aid/
1nxk5jc,hardofhearing,Fantasy hearing aids,"Hello I'm working on a fantasy webcomic where one of the characters is a hard of hearing teen, I'm rewriting about him while I'm doing a proper investigation and since It's a fantasy setting I've decided to redesign his hearing aids. At first these looked like our common real life ones but I've decided to turn them into these snail dragons that you can wear by developing a symbiotic relationship with them (made this choice as well bc as part of his backstory he belongs to a tribe that coexists with dragons). 

I'd love to know any recommendations or feeback since I'm not deaf myself.

That reminds me of the Babblefish from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Overall your idea and concept sound interesting.

Depending on your plot and world building, think about what getting used to having a dragonsnail in your ears be like. Is that something youd like to explore? Is being hard of hearing something you'd like to address plot wise? Is it considered a disability in the world? or how does each tribe and nation views your character due to his hearing loss? What kind of limitations does having dragonsnail aids and what positive attributes does it provide your character?

There's so much you can come up with and so much to think about, but it all depends on what story you're trying to tell.

I do like how it looks but I think I’d rather see something that looks more realistic. Or if a younger kid was reading it they might get excited to see something they’re wearing too. 

Either way works though! We need more representation.

Hiya - hearing aids shouldn’t cover up the whole ear. 

It’s not like a headphone for listening to music. 

Every person experiences hearing loss differently- their ear has very specific abilities to “funnel” the sound into your head. 

Try having your shell design off the ear - check out Cocher Implants.

I love the whole idea. Everything of it. And exactly as it is. Don’t change anything. I think real world issues with real hearing aids just do not apply in this context. Just point out the positive. I‘m pretty sure both Deaf and hearing kids will love the idea.

The only thing I would ask myself: If it is symbiotic, what do the snails get out of it? But you‘re a writer, so you‘ll figure it out. The reason could just lie in the past or is a reward for being a true dragon friend or that dragon snails just need trust, closeness, warmth and words to live. And they could go on a „walk“ and grass a bit nearby, when they feel the hero has fallen asleep (my first words in the morning would probably be: „Where are my snails???“ 😀).

By the way, I don‘t know if you are familiar with the process of being fitted with hearing aids. But when you get ear moulds (the part that sits in the ear), an impression is taken by squeezing a goo-ish (silicon-like) mass into your ear canal, which then expands and fills every corner of your ear canal. It feels exactly like a snail crawling into your ear (at least I guess that‘s what it would feel like).

Good luck with the story!

Greetings from Hamburg

If you need any assistance with describing how it may feel having that parasite in an ear, the Animorphs series from the 90s has a lot of descriptions because the antagonists are slug aliens that live in your ear/brain. 

I'd definitely consider what type of loss he has as that would help describe the functionality of the ""aids"" so to speak.

I dont have anything to add that wasnt already said above, but id just like to say i love this idea! Im both hard of hearing and an artist/designer, and this scratches such an itch for representation in media! Its inspiring me to wanna create my own hoh character &lt;33

I like the design, looks like a cochlea (look it up, huge part of inner ear) :))

1nxagy0,hardofhearing,I think I have hearing loss and I don't know who to ask (?,"the context:

about a month ago I bought a pair of Focal Bathys and I've started to notice something weird. Voices always sound louder/clearer on the right side, and I don't really hear them centered in my head. It feels like they're shifted to the right. On top of that, sometimes I get this kind of ""empty"" sensation in my left ear, almost like something's blocking it a bit.

I thought it might be the headphones, but when I flipped them around (right cup on left ear and vice versa), the voices actually sounded perfectly centered again.

so could this actually be hearing loss in my left ear? I notice the same thing when listening to voice messages too weird thing is, with in-ear headphones I don't really have this issue, maybe because they go directly into the ear, idk.

Also, in the channel balance I now have it slightly further to the left so I can hear the singer's voice centered in my head.

Can anyone suggest something to me? I doubt a Focal Bathys would come damaged lol

An audiologist assess hearing that’s who you have to ask.

Just go to an audiologist. I have progressive hearing loss and I am now a bit hyper vigilant about losing hearing. Differences when listening to music has always been a big indicator for me. The audiology test is usually around $100-150.

Hear in Canada, audiologists that sell HAs usually offer a free hearing test to bring people into the office.  Check to see if they do that where you live.  Most here also let you try out new ones risk free for a while, you can return them without an obligation.",2025-10-03 20:37:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nxagy0/i_think_i_have_hearing_loss_and_i_dont_know_who/
1nwalxg,hardofhearing,Dealing with fluctuating hearing loss,"So I, 20F, have been dealing with fluctuating hearing loss for around a year. For some backstory, I have an autoimmune disease that can lead to fluctuating hearing loss that flares up relatively frequently as well as autism with an auditory processing disorder. 

I have had 3 audiograms all with different results. One was at the end of a flare and showed conductive hearing loss, the 2nd was in the middle of one and showed mixed hearing loss so I got hearing aids, and the 3rd was between flares when I felt pretty good and it was normal. My audiologist told me to keep using my hearing aids when I need them but for some reason, I feel like a scam artist or something. Maybe it’s years of medical trauma but I feel like I’m making up my own hearing loss and don’t know if I can truly claim it or not.

Sometimes I can hear practically everything and other days I mostly just hear my own tinnitus. I’ve been struggling to figure out if I should learn ASL or just keep trudging through and hope my hearing doesn’t get worse. I’m also afraid that if I did learn ASL, I wouldn’t really need it? Even though I do struggle to hold conversation half the time.

Everything feels rather stressful when it comes to my hearing and I wish I felt like I had community where I am but I don’t.

“I’ve been struggling to figure out if I should learn asl or keep trudging through and hope my hearing doesn’t get worse” you originally said you have fluctuating hearing loss which means it’s going to get worse.

In your place I’d learn ASL as a “just in case”. You never know if your autoimmune disease will permanently effect your hearing one day so it makes sense to be ready",2025-10-02 17:44:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nwalxg/dealing_with_fluctuating_hearing_loss/

1nuiqod,hardofhearing,Please advise!!!,"My aunt went to the audiologist today and was classified as moderate hearing loss. Most frequencies need to be in the 60db range. But then they told her that her Medicare won’t cover her hearing aids. She is disabled, lives in government housing, and has almost no income. She cannot get a loan to pay for her aids. She tends two small children with special needs three days a week for her son and really needs her aids to be able to do that safely. Does anyone know of any options or resources besides her disability (who said they don’t cover that) and getting a loan (she cannot pay a loan)

Check in to the lions club foundation, starkey hearing foundation and Google search your state hearing aid grant programs.

Can also search device reutilization programs in your state. They tend to lean towards things like walkers and wheelchairs but if they don’t have hearing aids can possibly point you towards who might.

You should google organisations in your area that may be able to help

I hope you find a program to help you.  They certainly are expensive.  A slightly more affordable option may be going through Costco.  I paid about $1600 a year ago for the set.  I have moderate to severe hearing loss.  I know that’s still a lot of money but it may be more affordable than some other places.

Someone has already mentioned the Lions Club, but I want to second that. My friend donated her mom's hearing aids to them. 

Of course it's completely fucked up that Medicare won't cover hearing aids, as they are not a luxury item.

My mother got hearing aids from Costco for $1,500.

not sure about how to get hearing aids, but there are other free ways to help, such as signing! sometimes accommodating is cheaper than “fixing”

Look up the disability services in your state ( assuming you live in USA) 

They are often referred as voc rehab or disability services .. each state has it called something else. You can also contact the deaf schools to see if they have any resources that she could look into...


 If she qualifies they the state will pay if not she is back at square one.

Many HA businesses where I live donate older HAs to charities/organizations that redistribute them to people in need.   Check with local audiologists to see where they donate them to, and then contact those charities. 

Good luck.

You might want to look into OTC hearing aids. Some actually work fine for moderate loss. My mom uses a pair from audien hearing and they work perfectly well. They have FDA-registered models starting at around $200. Pretty basic but way better than nothing.",2025-09-30 17:01:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nuiqod/please_advise/

Two of them have never expressed any frustration with my hearing issues. At most, I'd get an occasional eye roll when I ask them to repeat themselves.

My youngest (m 12) just started Jr High and is a highly sensitive person. He's recently expressed to me twice that he feels really frustrated when we're in the car and I cant hear him.

In November I'm going to ger Costco hearing aids and I think that will help but does anyone have advice about how to talk to my (again highly emotionally sensitive) son about this?

TIA

""hey, kiddo. I've noticed that my hearing is really frustrating you. If I'm honest, my hearing frustrates me sometimes, too. Like when {I have to ask coworkers to repeat themselves for the third time because they won't actually speak up}. Or when I {can't hear the doorbell and have to drive all the way to the stupid ups access point when I was home}!

I promise I'm listening to you and always happy to talk with you, but I need your help. Try to meet me halfway. When we're in the car, it's harder for me because {I can't see you face to read you lips.} I need you to try to {remember to speak slowly and a little louder than you normally have to}. 

I love you so much and I don't want you to ever think that you are not important to me. I'm gonna try some hearing aids to see if I can try to meet you halfway, here. 

Does this make sense to you, kiddo?""

Just insert whatever real life details make sense for you in the brackets. 
Remember that tone and facial expression are gonna be really important with emotionally sensitive people. You got a emphasize that it US vs THE PROBLEM. Not you vs your kid.

Don't be defensive. Just let him talk. And keep in mind he is getting closer to puberty, so that is a lot of mental and emotional growth on his end along with the physical. He will be very tender and sensitive about everything.  

It's really important to give him the safe places where he can let out his hot air and know that yes the and you can't change the hearing loss but he knows and you know that within each other there is safety. And no defensiveness going on.

1ntyv8h,hardofhearing,audiogram advice for low frequency struggles,"Update: turns out the place i was going to get my hearing tested wont let me as im too young, apparently unless its age related it \*has\* to be investigated by the nhs first according to the email i got, which makes sense i would want a doctor to properly investigate instead of just prescribing aids, but i was always planning on getting the basic test done at this place while i wait for an nhs appointment. Unfortunately I may be waiting up to 18 weeks simply for the assessment, and i am seriously struggling in my college now

\----

So i finally got my hearing test booked for the end of this week, and i am so nervous  
my last one was back in march and it came back normal despite obvious struggles, and we've determined it was the audiologist that i saw not doing in depth enough testing and only looking for high frequency loss (which i think is fairly mild for me now but may have been normal at the time)  
i have since gotten worse, i think losing some high frequencies may have made the lost low ones way more obvious, and im seeing a different free provider while im waiting on a referral to the nhs services so it should hopefully go better  
i am going to make sure i mention this to them, but im also wondering if i can ask for a ""reset"" inbetween tones during the beep test, as after a couple tones my tinnitus ends up getting louder and louder until its louder than the test itself, i end up hearing phantom versions of the actual tones that ive already heard, and its very dizzying so i think i need many breaks where i hear something normal inbetween to get accurate results?  
i am very nervous that i wont see a good audiologist again that wont test for low tones, is there anything else i could say or do to potentially make this a little easier?

My test done by the nhs covered ranges from 250hz to 8khz. Your audiologist should ask if you have tinnitus before they start if they don’t then tell them.

1ntqi8i,hardofhearing,Anticipating Dinner Table Syndrome- Advice?,"For those unfamiliar- Dinner Table Syndrome is the experience of being left out (intentionally or unintentionally) of conversation because of hearing issues (and/or lack of access such as sign language use). Usually, at the dinner table, but I'm sure all of us have experienced it in many places. 

I'm going to a small event in a few hours, and already know this is going to be an issue. It's sounding like it'll be 10-ish people, and exactly 2 of them ever bother to include me in the conversation in any way. 

It's my brother-in-law's birthday dinner, at a restaurant I can't even eat at, and my husband and father-in-law are the ones who generally make an effort to include me. I'm only hoping I'll be able to sit near enough to FIL for that much to even be an option. 

Does anyone have any advice? I truly can't explain why I continue bothering to go to these things, but somehow I guess I've decided to go. Thanks in advance. 

[댓글]
Tell your father in law ahead of time that you'd love to sit with him at dinner, save you a seat so you can catch up.

I suggest using the wireless microphone (tiny device, not the karaoke microphone lol)  that connects to your phone via Bluetooth. Use the caption app on your phone and the mic should be able to pick up the sounds and spell out words. I have an IPhone 16 and it comes with built in caption.

Oh this is probably the reason I end up drinking more than I should at these type of things !

When I’m in this situation, I do my best to follow the mannerisms of everyone else at the table (laughing when they laugh, for instance) and get real comfortable with the fact that I’ll have hardly a clue what the plot of the conversation is lol. 

It’s exhausting trying to make hearing people consider me and I’d rather occasionally feel left out than intentionally ignored.

I relate to this so hard. I have multiple food allergies, so I can't eat at many restaurants, so I go to hang out, but then I can't hear anyone. I'm not much help, but just know you aren't alone in this. Most of the time at restaurants I just sit there looking around or honestly, I sit next to the kids if there are any. They dont care as much if I need them to repeat themselves and I can just have silly little conversations with them so it doesnt mind if I miss something and sound a little goofy.

1ntkwma,hardofhearing,Jabra Disabled My Hearing Aids Remotely Without Warning,"I bought a pair of Jabra Enhance 500 hearing aids in late July for $2,100, financed through Bread Payments. Two weeks later, they went on sale for $300 off, and Jabra refunded me that amount after I asked. But then, without explanation, they refunded another $1,400. I kept making payments, never knowing the balance was lower.

A few weeks later, I got a call from someone at Jabra named Morgan, who said they’d accidentally refunded the full amount (they didn't) and I’d need to return the hearing aids. She promised a deep discount on a new pair, including the new 700 model, and said I’d receive the replacements *before* sending mine back. That never happened. I'm still making payments to Bread. Most recently, today.

Then, this past Friday at 5 PM, Jabra remotely disabled my hearing aids. No warning. They stopped pairing with the app, lost their programming, and I was left in silence. I had no idea remote deactivation was even possible. I’ve become really dependent on them, and losing access like that was jarring and isolating.

I called customer service this morning and was told it could take up to five business days for a manager to respond. Meanwhile, I’m stuck without hearing support because of a refund error I didn’t cause, and a promise that was never kept.

I’m sharing this because I think it’s important for others to know that remote disablement is a thing. These aren’t luxury items. They’re medical devices. If a company can cut off your access without notice, that’s a serious ethical issue.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I’d love to hear how you handled it or if you have advice on how to escalate it.

[댓글]
I'm very surprised about the since the FDA regulates medical devices to ensure safety and effectiveness. 

If Jabra did this, that would mean they did a post sale modification without a medical or safety justification and that is a very good way to get the FDA's attention.

Not only that, I can think of four different ways a lawyer would take on this, depending on the contract and finance agreements...

Breach of contract, breach of warranty, violation of customer protection statutes, tortious interference with property and even if the contracts do include clauses, I can see the courts taking a dim view on this.

but I'm layman and I'd double check with a qualified professional on that aspect.

Wow. That is some bullsh!t.

I believe GN Resound owns the Jabra brand. Let them know about this.

This is dystopian

Very black mirror like! How horrible, I still don't understand why they view hearing aids as cosmetic....like, I can't hear without them? 😢🫠

contact your state attorney general’s office.

So that's why hearing aids went digital, it wasn't because they are better, it was so they can control them from their computer.

I wonder whether there is any civil rights organisation that would be interested in taking this on as a case. Aside from the fact that it was their mistake not yours which caused this, it is absolutely disgusting that a company would just turn somebody's hearing aids off without knowing what is going on in their life. You could be having a medical emergency, giving birth, right in the middle of something absolutely critical... this is beyond vile.

You definitely need to first discuss about your question with your audiologist and the medical team that knows well about the mentioned surgery.

1nszkdt,hardofhearing,OMG I had no idea this group was a thing! Mind BLOWN!,"Okay, I know the title sounds dramatic, but I genuinely had no idea that so many people were dealing with the same things I have.

I have literally never communicated with \*anyone\* who I can relate to about this stuff.

I had chronic ear infections for the first 5 years of life, when I was 6, I contracted meningitis, and was diagnosed as deaf 1 year later. It sounds unbelievable to say that \*no adults noticed that I was deaf for a YEAR\* but that's really what happened (to say that my parents didn't have their shit together would be an understatement).

My parents immediately had me get a surgical procedure to restore some of my hearing, then I spent the rest of my childhood getting regular surgeries/tubes implanted in my ears.

It never once occurred to them to teach me ASL or to talk to anyone in the deaf community about options. Which, considering that we lived in Fremont, CA (huge deaf school/community), is absolutely bonkers to me. Just endless surgeries for me! Wheee!

I have been HoH forever, but I can read lips okayish and always just got by b/c I didn't want to deal with aides or more procedures when I turned 18 (I'm now 42). I didn't even really think much about my condition until the pandemic, when everyone was in masks, and I realized how much I had actually come to rely on reading lips. I suddenly felt like I on a deserted island or something. I still can't explain it.

Anyways, I'm in a 25-year relationship with the loudest person I know, and we have three really loud kids, lol. My friends all know about my hearing, and I am lucky to have found people who will raise their voice for me regularly.

I am honestly so lucky to have people like this; however, since 2020 I've been really aware that no matter how much they understand my situation, they have no real idea what it's like to live like this. For example, even my 'husband' and kids are still shocked when I can't hear some high-pitched sound that my car is making, or the neighbor's generator. ""No, I didn't realize the dishwasher wasn't running, because I can never hear it, anyways"" type stuff.

I'm bad company at a restaurant b/c I can't join in a conversation since I can't hear more than mumbles when I chew. I have to ask people to repeat themselves all day, every day (honestly, this must be so annoying to them). The amount of times that I have just smiled and nodded at who knows what-- omg. Anyways.

I'm just sharing because, well, I've never had anyone to share this with. It's nice not to feel like an odd-woman-out for a change.

If anyone in here has any experience with OTC hearing aids I would love to know how they worked for you. Thanks for taking the time. &lt;3

\*\*\*edit to ask--&gt; How many of you hear constant ringing/whooshing sounds?

This is basically my life, parents included. You're not alone.

Regarding OTC Hearing Aids, they're touch and go for me, none of them really helping a whole lot, but I use them just for that extra bit even if it's minimal at best. I work with speech therapist on various methods especially to help me in group settings and loud environments and I even bought those digital transcription glasses. I'll take anything to help me.

My advice would be talk to your ENT, if not OTC maybe they have access to some top of the line hearing aids that could actually help. I would, but I can't afford those at this moment.

In addition, I whole heartedly recommend speech therapy and individual therapist that specializes with deaf and HoH people to work through your hearing issues that definitely come from not being able to communicate correctly. They can help you build a healthier pattern of communication and advocating for yourself when everyone around you are hearing.

Hope this helps.

Welcome! Might wanna look into a table mic (paired to hearing aids) for restaurants btw. My partner and I hardly go out to eat anymore bc of noise (and I like to cook and it saves us money), but I know your situation may be different.

Hello! HoH here 45f,  I've been using hearing aids for about 20 years and looking at having cochlears done next year. I don't know about where you are, but here in Australia I wouldn't bother with the equivalent of OTC. I tried it and then ended up having to fork out more for new ones a year or two later because there were nothing but problems, but I may have been unlucky. I currently have phonek audeo aids and I love them! I also use a mic called Roger On that is pretty good for noisy situations, not perfect, but damn better than without it. I've seen the caption glasses but so far a bit out of my price range for what they can do, I'm going to let the tech advance a bit then look at it again once I'm settled with my cochlears. 

It's expensive being HoH isn't it! 

Yep I've tinnitus as well, the ringing in the ears, I do find my hearing aids help slightly with that but it's still damn annoying!

Greetings fellow human. I am here and I can’t hear. (but I can read just fine lol) It’s nice to make your acquaintance.

i’d love to pm you, i don’t mind making new friends and no one needs to be alone!!!! my dad lied and kept mine a secret and told folks i passed, i found out as an adult im  hoh and went back into my medical files - and voila i went to my first deaf social this week and it was soooo iverwhelming but im learning and made new friends!!!!

Hearing aids have made a significant improvement to my life and relationships

Do you have tinnitus?

Constant tinnitus in F major. Get's louder  than the external sounds around me. Wheeee!

Edit: typos

Yeah, I recently found out that I've likely had hearing lost my whole life. We had several family members that grew up hard a hearing, and they never were told to even look into sign language. Apparently It's common for resources to not be talked about.
Sad because so many of us out there struggling and really could have benefited from learning this stuff earlier.

Glad you found community, OP. 

  
Also, shout out to all the LOUD family members/friends! :)

That's three eye openers today, thanks..

I could have written your post, minus the meningitis. 

I, too, had no idea I was lip reading so much until Covid! I had to start paying more attention to eyes and body language. 

I briefly met two deaf women while I was growing up. One knew how to lip read and it encouraged me to do it too. I wish my parents would have gotten me into ASL classes or something. It's hard to feel like I don't really belong in the Deaf community because I don't sign. I don't feel I belong in the hearing community either because they just don't understand... 

Do you do ever do this? I often watch videos on mute and read the lips of whoever I'm watching and I try to guess what their voice sounds like. Then I unmute and compare. Often times it sounds like their voice in my head. lol (OK, that sounds crazy.)

If you'd ever like an online buddy who has been thrift similar life things, feel free to reach out via DM. Would be happy to hear (ha!) from you.

I was in a somewhat similar situation (not deaf from birth, but progressive hearing loss over time), and I finally decided to try OTC hearing aids a while back. I will still stick with Nova hearing aids, as they've made it much easier for me to follow conversation without constantly asking people to repeat themselves and the background noise reduction also helps a ton in busy places.

I love my Resound hearing aids. Have you had a hearing test done by an ENT?

I have hearing aids from Costco. They’re Phillips, they pair to my phone (I can set it in front of a speaker as a mic), car, and they made a huge impact! Also I have tinnitus (the ringing!) and they actually help with that some too!

iPhones have an accessibility setting called Live Captions. It will real-time caption on your phone screen sounds from the microphone or whatever media your phone is playing. It also has an option to save captions from phone calls.  It's very easy to use and is free (with iPhone purchase of course).

I had my first ear surgery in 1969 and i am about to have my 6th in Oct 2025.

I feel you, I only just found this community too and apparently have been hoh my entire life too. Funny thing is back in my day gosh I sound old anyway they would do a hearing tests in school at the nurses office and every time the nurse would say stop faking or stop lying or stop playing a game this isn't funny or a game, they threw me into what they called the rabbit room for my entire life turns out now that I finally got it all checked out and stuff to hearing, I actually have been hard of hearing my entire life and they never cared to even check at least I found out now, now that I'm old.

Sounds like you're to the moderate end of it.  I remember hearing some of those things even without aids back when I had a mild loss.  

Hearing aids are information compressors.  The typical range of human hearing volume-wise is like 0 dB to 100 dB which is a factor of like ... a lot... if I recall right from math that means very loud sounds are 10,000,000,000 times more powerful than very quiet sounds.  Decibels are non-linear.

Not just the frequency but also the dynamic, the volume level, is received by the ear and processed by the brain.  And we lose so much of that with hearing aids.

The quietest softest sounds have to be smushed to fit in the decibel range that we can hear.  For me at the higher frequencies it's like this 10 dB window up at around 100 dB (very loud!).

So *screech*.  All those sounds you mention the high frequency component, when I turn my hearing aids way up, is presented to me as *screech* because *screech* is the only thing I can hear. 

I still recognize most of the sounds.  It's part of why I don't usually identify as deaf. I have a brain that's wired for sound.  Like I was shaving the other day with my hearing aids in.  (I don't normally.)  I guess I was hearing shaving for the first  time in a long time, probably since I was a young man, and there's this uniquely hoarse gritty raspy *scrape* sound.  And it didn't even startle me it was implicitly familiar as the sound of hair being cut by a razor.  I remembered it and it was comforting!   But it also sounded a bit wrong, too harsh, too loud.

Oh well.  I find with hearing aids, they make me aware of things like someone knocking or even just talking outside in the hall -- better than for a lot of hearing people with good hearing.  But only in terms of detecting noises and hearing in real silence from a distance.  And only when I have them cranked up louder than I find pleasant.

Mixed bag.  The world is so loud!  You forget.   But not completely.  It comes back quick.",2025-09-28 12:18:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nsmw0b/realising_these_things_make_sound/
1ns3bxo,hardofhearing,Very thin ear drum,"Hi, interested to hear of any experiences from people who have a very thin ear drum. Used to have ear problems as a kid only in my left and I've just started the gym and when I lift weights pressure builds in my ear like I'm on a plane.

I had it syringed a few years ago and the nurse was shocked that I'm not in pain and said that if she knew my eardrum was so thin she would never have syringed it. Apparently it's that thin they only way she could see if was there was that she could see some of the blood vessels but could actually see straight through it and all the little bones etc that you wouldn't normally be able to see. My other ear is normal.

Apart from this pressure problem I've started to get I also suffer from vertigo at random but it can be quite bad. I'm guessing there's no cure for something like this but I've wondered if anyone has something similar and has any suggestions on what helps?

1nrbp9s,hardofhearing,I built this app for my HoH partner.,"My partner is HoH and struggles in certain situations where someone is not speaking loud enough or next to her.

In June Apple announced new speech to text models coming in iOS 26, and I saw a chance to build something that could help. I am a software engineer, and after months of testing and refining, I just launched [Hearing Buddy](https://hearingbuddyapp.com), a real-time transcription app designed for her but hopefully useful for many.

What makes it different?

* Unlimited high quality captions are free forever. Captions should not be a luxury.
* Everything is processed on-device. No data ever leaves your phone, and no recordings or transcripts are sent anywhere.
* It works completely offline after setup, so you can run it any time without worrying about limits or connection.
* Pro features include speaker detection, AI-powered summaries, and streaming captions to Mac or Apple Watch.

I built Hearing Buddy for my partner, but I want to make it better for anyone who needs it. I would love your feedback.

Here is a code for a free year of Pro if you want to try those features: **HOHBUDDIES**

Redeem here: [https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=6747363502&amp;code=HOHBUDDIES](https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=6747363502&amp;code=HOHBUDDIES)

If you are interested in beta testing new releases as they come out, please comment here and I will send you an invite to the TestFlight group. Thanks a bunch.

Feel free to also share this on r/deaftech I’m trying to collect projects like this. I love the ability to generate transcriptions locally.

Is this available for Android?

I just installed it! I can’t wait to try it out!

What a good idea.  Does it work with different accents?

I’ve been trying to develop something like this in my free time! Thank you!
Just a couple of questions:
Do you recommend getting external microphones? What is the best setup? Even in noisy situations.

Following - when I get updated to IOS 26

I would be interested but I haven’t got iOS 26 yet. Desperately looking for something to use in work and social environments, so excited to test this out

This will be fun to try.

I'm interested in betas! Thank you for making this. Very generous to offer one year free.

I really want to test this out. I work with kids and am still learning sign so an interpreter wouldn’t be beneficial for me at the moment.

I would love to be part of the TestFlight group!

omg i need this thank you!!

That is so amazing, thank you for doing this!!
Unfortunately I am an android user .. 😭💔

What is the difference between this app and Otter?

Wow awesome and thanks for the year trial. This definitely looks quite useful for me. Going to have to try it with the apple watch.

Is there a version for Android?

I tried downloading but my iOS is too old. I guess I’m gonna hafta upgrade my old phone.

Seems amazing so far! Can’t wait to try it out at work next week and see how it compares to Otter, which I am somewhat ambivalent about. Thank you!!

1nqt405,hardofhearing,Learning ASL with apps + regional signs question,"Hi everyone,
I’m HOH and live in a rural area of southern Oklahoma where there aren’t many options for in-person ASL classes. I’ve taken ASL 1 in person, then ASL 1 as a refresher and ASL 2 through the Oklahoma School for the Deaf’s website.

Lately, I’ve been using this app to keep practicing. I like that it gives me good practice tools and even has you work on making full sentences, not just single signs.

My concern is that I’ve noticed a lot of regional signs are used in my area, and I don’t want to come across as “foolish” if what I’m learning in the app doesn’t always match what people here use.

Has anyone else run into this? Do you think apps are still worth it in the long run, or should I focus on different resources? Any advice or suggestions would mean a lot

Hi! I teach ASL in North Texas! I don't think the accent will be a bad thing if you learn a bit different. I do think that learning through interaction if you can find deaf events near where you live would be so incredibly helpful with receptive skills.

1nqq6n0,hardofhearing,This is so isolating,"Before my hearing aids were ruined in a car accident i still could barely hear in loud environments and people wouldn’t accommodate because they figured hearing aids magically fixed me.

Two years without them and man im still isolated. Even at work if more than one person is talking i can’t understand anyone. Im glad i like my own company but its been harder lately to deal with the isolation. Went out with an old friend and he was pretty peeved i had trouble hearing him and he had to speak up. Went out with coworkers and a lot of it was me standing in silence while they talked because they forgot i was HoH while we were out. 

Im going out with more coworkers this weekend to a sports bar and i cant be excited about it. Ugh. 

Now its like, do i get hearing aids again and have people completely give up on accommodating? The 10% of effort people could be assed to give? Ill still have loved ones snapping at me. $4,000 with insurance before. Now my insurance is worse and the one place that takes it is booked until February. 

I cant read lips or sign. Im just tired of feeling alone! This sucks hard lately and its been harder to not snap at people when they get mad that i didnt hear them the first time. Maybe it was the hearing aids? Oticons cros. I dont know. I hope youre all having a good night! 

Edit: thank you guys, youve been very sweet. It helps to hear different perspectives and the advice as well. ❤️ hope to get new ones feb. :)

Yes, you should get hearing aids.

Yes, you should learn sign language.

You simply need to arrange your life so that those things are possible. 

Personally, I get isolated even with hearing aids. Don’t take inclusion for granted. As HoH it’s something that takes huge amounts of work.

I completely understand what it’s like. People don’t get annoyed at blind people for not seeing but if you can’t hear it seems ok to be irritated. Costco has reasonably priced hearing aids with a membership, if you wanted to try them again. They won’t help in noisy environments but in the office they are ok.

I understand you completely. I am deaf and have a CI but even with the CI it can be so hard to hear people especially groups or in a noisy place. It’s like being in a roomful of people who don’t speak my language. I can hear their voices but can’t understand their words. It is especially painful when I realize I am missing chances to develop friendships because I can’t just chit chat with the people around me. I’m alone at work because I can’t follow the conversation and I am alone outside of work because no one puts in the time to get to know the stranger who needs you to repeat yourself.

Are you in the US? If so, you can check with your state's vocational rehab office. My state paid for my last pair of hearing aids but you have to open a case and ask.

I am HoH as well and the experience is, indeed, quite isolating. I can’t hear regular people taking but I don’t sign either, so I can’t communicate with  deaf folks. I fit in nowhere. We need people though. That human connection is far more important than we realize. I’ve been told I have to find a community where I would fit in. I’m looking into online sign language classes, but honestly, at the end of the work day, I barely have the time and energy to make my family dinner, let alone learn a whole new language. So, I don’t have any great answers for you. I’m just commiserating with you.

i do personally think you should try lipreading- there is a website i have used in the past to help my lipreading, i could find it if you’d like

I was born with a bineural loss-discovered at 5 yrs old. Been wearing hearing aids for years-always disappointed until this last pair I bought-of all places? On AMAZON. Yes, it’s now permissible to sell hearing aids online straight to consumer.
I’d highly recommend these but I honestly didn’t think they work for my moderate to severe loss.

I use to be mild to moderate range when younger but I’m middle age now.  I’m using them at home mainly and doctor visits. So environment is super noisy.    I’ve bought hearing aids on line before after spending thousands on state of the art hearing aids and being let down.
Not to mention out of money-which my father had generously laid out.

That 6 grand expense is what made me angry enough to forego audiology places that sell hearing aids.  My last pair from Amazon? It’s the best pair I ever owned and yes,even I am shocked to state that!

Totally agree about the isolation..

I had one eardrum removed surgically did to chronic cholesteatoma, so down to one ear hearing.. that was 20 year ago.

Remaining ear requires an aid. As a veteran my hearing aids are supplied by the VA, thankfully. I have also purchased the occasional hearing device. These are the new crop of hearing aids marketed directly to consumers, although they can't call them'hearing aids'.

They are quite affordable and frankly do some to be of some help with hearing. However, all aids seem to suffer from the inability to actually act like original equipment ears...😉

At least now I can hear the TV shows, of course I am reading the captions along with the dialog. Fortunately the ads are not captioned yet, that is a relief... :-)

The isolation remains... One on one in a quiet environment is possible, and really great.. However, how often do you get that opportunity...? Infrequently at Best...I have a standing lunch date with an old friend, we go to a local tavern, mid afternoon, when it is usually almost empty...I sit him on my remaining ear side, and we can get thru it ok. Two old guys, sitting at the bar, having a chat. Almost the only socialization I get these days. 

I am 81, living alone in my own home... My domestic partner passed 18 months ago ... My hearing impairment was always an irritation for us, and understandably so. It's difficult to express endearments when you have to shout, or to have to look at each other when talking so I could see her lips move... She was a total loving creature but it was difficult, at best, for her, for us both, actually, to just have mild innocuous conversation...🫤

 There are seniors activities here in my rural town, the noise level at these functions makes it impossible to join in, promoting further isolation... 

You really have to like yourself when you are hearing impaired...
The thought of being social, even though much desired, is an almost impossible task in the hearing world, for those of us impaired...

I'm sorry you're going through this rough patch. Have you looked into some organizations? There might be somebody that can  help get the cost down.

Remember there are table mics, too, which can also connect to your hearing aids. I’m older now so most of these problems don’t impact me (not to say that I’m not more isolated, though, to your point). Perhaps shifting your interests a title - instead of loud bars and restaurants - doing more one on one activities. I don’t feel lonely bc I have a gf who is an introvert and we don’t like loud, busy places anyway. I still have many moments, though, where I struggle socializing. I get it. Even my office is a bit of an open office. I turn my aids down and listen to ambient music and then, if I feel like socializing, I come out of my cube.

I get this so much. Hearing aids don’t fix everything, but they take off some of the weight. Without them it’s all on you, and that’s exhausting.

I hated my Oticon BiCROS (I’m deaf in my left ear,moderate/severe on the right)) they just frustrated me. like you i give up for big chunk of my life and isolate myself because hearing was just a whole job, until a good audiologist help me found the right set up. Now I just use one Phonak Audéo Sphere Infinio on my right and it’s the best I’ve ever had. Total game changer. I also got a cochlear on my left, which helps, but even with all the tech I still miss lots of things and need accommodations and lots of underestanding. That part never goes away.

It’s a fight, but one worth taking, you deserve to be included!!

You will probably find that new hearing aids will work better than your old ones did. Your hearing is never going to be perfect, and unfortunately it will always be a struggle. I deal with it too.

Hi, where are you from? There are non-profits for situations like this where you can get the help you need to cover the cost of hearing aids. [Here’s](https://www.pacifichearingconnection.org/become-a-patient) an example of one near me. Hearing aids are expensive but there are ways to get help. I’d really recommend looking into it.

I feel for you. It's not something I deal with much, but I'm an ass about it if people don't make the effort to include me.  My hearing loss is a sex linked genetic trait. That means all the men on my fathers side have hearing issues. The severity differs, but we all have it.  If you are feeling snarky, make a button that says functionally deaf, speak be ignored!  When people get aggravated I can't hear or understand them I just remind them they were told and it's not my fault they didn't listen.  I get rude depending on the situation.   I would highly advise learning ASL and even when you understand them sign rather than talk.  Then as over the top as you can apologize and say you forgot they don't sign.  Another one i employ is telling them what i heard them say and when they say that isn't even close feign relief because you were worried they were having a stroke,  and oh yeah, YOU'RE DEAF. SO SPEAK UP.  Like I said, I'm a bit of a jerk about this.  As for practical help, I use a translation app or talk to text when having conversations.  It's not perfect but it helps.

In my state the department of deaf and hard of hearing also offers therapy to help you cope.  This is a life altering opportunity.  A therapist who has worked with deaf and hard of hearing people can help you develop skills to handle your work and social needs and help you develop strategies to find resources.  In my state it is free.

Using speech to text is helpful in situations when you can't understand. But I agree with others. State voc rehab and learn sign language

This is a very common feeling for HOH people, and it sucks because hearing people can never understand where we are coming from. You can try explaining things to people about your situation and how you’ve been feeling, most people unfortunately never remember our disability since it is invisible. Sometimes I want to get “hard of hearing” tattooed across my forehead so people don’t forget 😭 I would always recommend learning sign language as well! The unfortunate downside is most people don’t know the language, and I’m almost positive none of the people you hang out with and feel isolated around know it either, and probably won’t care to learn it. It’s hard to come to terms with sometimes. If you haven’t already I’d definitely try explaining your situation to your friends and loved ones. Hearing aids always help, but you shouldn’t have to feel forced to get them.

My tinnitus would ruin me forever and drive me insane if I didn’t have the audio stimulation of hearing aids

I think I have a similar degree of hearing loss to you and yes, the most impactful aspect is how isolating it is. Pubs and restaurants are completely out and socialising is really hard. I use hearing aids and have got reasonably good at lipreading (I'd say I use it 40% of the time roughly) but that hasn't made a whole bunch of difference to the isolation really. At the same time, the demands placed on you, family, work etc are exactly the same as when I could hear. It's a difficult thing to go through and all I can recommend really is making the time to develop the skills that you need to cope a little better with it. And be a bit grumpy and selfish regarding accommodation of your hearing loss with work etc.",2025-09-26 02:50:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nqq6n0/this_is_so_isolating/

lowkey is it normal to have to focus on sounds this much? if where i am is quiet i dont struggle so much, but its impossible to make the world silent enough for me to be able to hear good

Would ""like being underwater"" be accurate at all ?  does it come and go somewhat with sinus and chest congestion? 

""really painful airplane ear"" and ""muffling"" and the fact of doing okay on a high pitch beep test is suggesting some sort of conductive thing but I'm no expert

It sounds like you're taking the right action by seeing an ENT.  Your doc will probably suggest an audiologist.  Get a real hearing test done right.  There are tests for your ability to understand language under various conditions.  Like they'll say words and you repeat them back and they'll add increasingly loud masking noise.  

It's definitely possible to score quite badly on those while having ""normal"" hearing on the beep test.

Opinions differ on how to interpret that effect.  Is it hearing loss?  Does it originate in the middle ear, cochlea, or nervous system?  Is auditory processing disorder under hearing loss? 

In terms of hard of hearing or deaf support services -- it sounds like you can't hear and understand speech very well.  I wouldn't say you're in the wrong place based on that.  But don't rush into anything or to any conclusions just yet, either.  (Other than treating the medical side of it urgently.)  In particular, if you need interpreting services and they are available, use them.

I feel for you, it can be maddening to get an appointment with the right person that is qualified to run the right tests to determine what’s going on. I’ve been in hearing aid offices where they were selling artwork, crafts and other items in addition to the audiology services. As soon as I stepped through the front door, I knew I wasn’t going to get anywhere. 

I was then finally referred to an audiologist that did nothing but audiology exams and dispense hearing aids from the well known manufacturers. I was in her office for four hours having a battery of tests run that I had read about, but never seen. By the end of the appointment, I had a definite diagnosis of Vestibular Migraine with a 60% hearing loss in my left ear and 100% speech discrimination loss in my left ear. She referred me to a surgeon to be evaluated for a Cochlear Implant. 

It took me Five years to get to that point, and another two years to get an implant. 

I was frightened by the number of people out there claiming to be hearing health providers, that can barely administer an audiology exam, and seem to be there to sell $5,000 hearing aids whether they help you or not. 

I am sorry you are going through this, but don’t give up, help is out there. Eventually, you will find someone that can help you, just don’t accept second best.

I would go to an audiologist. They can test your middle ear to see if you have negative pressure. This can happen when you have congestion and it sounds like you’ve dealt with a lot of that lately. Issues with middle ear pressure usually affect the low to mid frequencies first, which would also match up. 

They can test your detection of pure tones (beeps) in the presence of background noise. They can also give you a speech discrimination test (so they’re not just seeing at what levels you can detect sound, but determine what speech sounds you are or aren’t hearing clearly) with background noise. 

I’ve dealt with temporary hearing loss from middle ear issues before. I also felt tired, isolated, and frustrated. Hang in there!",2025-09-25 18:17:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nqeagu/lack_of_support_rn_anyone_have_any_advice_or_kind/
1nptgv1,hardofhearing,Married to HOH husband who won't wear hearing aids,"I'm so frustrated with this situation. My husband, who has had hearing aids for about a decade hates wearing them just won't wear them around me (he wears them all day at work). They are the kind that you can barely see - he just hates how they feel in his ears and some noises (like a dish banging) are way too piercing for him.  It took several years of arguing over him being hard of hearing and him trying to reverse it to say I am then we both got our hearing tested and lo and behold, he had significant hearing loss. I felt happy he finally got hearing aids, but irritated I had to endure being blamed for his hearing loss.

As a result of this, he will not ever wear his hearing aids at home. Obviously, this results in decreased communication between us, which is already an issue. He mumbles because it feels loud to him when he talks but gets mad at me if I ask him to repeat himself (and jumps on the opportunity to say ""you're so hard of hearing!"" when, after him getting hearing aids, I have never said such a thing to him), and of course, he has a really hard time hearing me. When he can't hear what I say, sometimes he just won't respond but I know he heard that I said something so I have to ask ""did you hear me?"" and then he gets mad. So I just always assume he didn't hear me to give him the benefit of the doubt. But when I do that and he DID hear me, he's offended.

God forbid we go out anywhere. We just don't talk at dinner. I've suggested us learning sign language, but he refuses to do this. My conclusion is just that he doesn't really WANT to hear me. On my birthday we went out to dinner and he actually wore his hearing aids and had a really nice dinner; I felt listened to and we had a nice conversation. But I don't want it to be a once a year thing.

Is this normal? Do other couples deal with this? I don't mind being married to someone hard of hearing, but I feel like he needs to come to terms with it. Until then, I'm sorta dangling out here with someone who shuts down.

I’m hard of hearing and wear bilateral cochlear implants. I totally understand being tired from listening all day at work and not wanting to talk at home. When I get home, I have a few hours of what I call deaf time - not wearing my implants and doing my own thing. However, I still wear my implants when talking with my mom - over dinner, walking the dog, etc. My suggestion is to suggest this compromise to your husband. Best of luck!

I understand this. I am always so tired at the end of the working day where I’ve had to wear my hearing aids. I feel overwhelmed and desperate to get the unnatural feeling away from me. Typically I have a headache and the noises that get over amplified just irritate me. 

Your husband sounds irritated and somewhat resentful, at the aids and at you. 

It sounds like there have been some not very respectful behaviours developed on both sides. He’s clearly feeling some stigma attached to having lost some hearing and has an angry retort for you when you don’t hear him.  In return, you asking “did you hear me?” I am certain has the potential to annoy and even hurt him. It’s got an accusatory tone to it which highlights what he might feel is his weakness each time you say it. When all is said and done, he’s human and will want to feel that he’s still as capable as ever. 

I would suggest some counselling where you get to the root of his feelings and of course your own.

Sometimes it's the brand of hearing aids that are cause. I had hearing aids that did not feel right because it did not sound right or clear . (Hard to explain) But then I had an audiologist switch brands and it made all other difference.

I can’t stand wearing my hearing aids any longer than I absolutely have to. The amplified sound in the world is so jarring and discordant, and it’s non-stop all day while I’m away from home. It’s nice to hear all the hidden sounds in music, but that’s it. 

It might help you to understand if you try to think of it this way: you know how it feels when you’ve been in a darkened theater for hours (or have your eyes dilated at the optometrist?) then you step outside into harsh, bright sunlight? Other people outside are carrying on with their day and for them the light is fine— it’s normal. But while your eyes are readjusting, the sunlight is overwhelming. 

Now try to imagine that your eyes never really readjust. That light (sound with hearing aids) is always overwhelming, sometimes painful. It would be exhausting navigating your entire day, every day, under harsh light. Other people are operating comfortably because that’s their “normal”, but it causes you fatigue. 

When you get back home you can turn the lights back down to your comfort zone and finally relax. 

Maybe for your husband, you insisting on him wearing the hearing aids is like someone firing up stadium lights pointed right at your face after you already spent all day under harsh lights. 

I get overstimulated every time I wear my hearing aids. Even paper rustling has a sound. My dog’s shrill bark makes my brain quiver and try to crawl out of my ears. 

If I had to wear my hearing aids at home I’d be too irritable to be around. If my spouse insisted I wear them, I’d feel like he didn’t understand what he was asking from me. I’d rather go fully deaf than have to hear everything most people hear all the time. It’s torture. The only relief comes when I can pull out the hearing aids and stop the cacophony. 

Another thing you might not realize is that it’s harder to “listen” again after you remove hearing aids. It’s almost like I get lazy with my listening when I’m wearing the hearing aids because the hearing aids are filling in all the blanks (the missing sounds) I'd usually have to piece together by following context. When I pull the earpieces out I have to actively listen again (follow people room to room, watch their faces, ask them to face me when they speak) and piece together context clues to understand speech and noise again at home. Even so, I just want to yank the earpieces out, turn on the video captions, and finally have peace. 

My husband would get rid of my hearing aids altogether if it was his call (they make me so crabby and he knows they hurt my ears and my head), but I need them during the daytime. 

We text each other a lot at home. He puts captions on TV and HBO has an ASL interpreter on a lot of movies (you can learn ASL at home— look up Dawn Sign Press Interactive series). Maybe your husband doesn’t want to take an outside class, but he might be open to one you can take at home. Signing is more fun than he’d think. The first time I watched my husband sign ""Want(a) Pile(of) Chicken Wings"" lives in my head. 

Your husband sounds stubborn, yes, but I get it. Maybe if you wore really loud AirPods all day (even past the point where your head aches and your ears are sore) to simulate how uncomfortable it is to listen to loudness all day, it would make more sense. I feel sad when I think that my husband might feel the same way you do, because I love him and want to communicate with him. But I know he hates my hearing aids more than I do because they make me miserable… and he’s my sanctuary and my comfort at the end of the day when I finally turn off the sound to be at home.

How old are the aids? If recent, last couple of years, he most likely needs to have the programming adjusted by his audiologist.

So everyone in my house has hearing aids (me, hubby, and my dad). I hate mine. I love them when I’m on the phone and everything goes right into my ears, but I have very small ears (was born prematurely) and I wear glasses, so when I have both on it HURTS. Plus like others said, hearing fatigue is a big thing. 

My 84 year old dad has discovered that he can watch videos and reels on his phone with it going straight to his HAs while watching TV. It’s like he’s 17. 

My husband is frequently in work meetings (WFH) and he doesn’t hear anything else. 

Our solution is to just text each other to get their attention and then we can either respond via text or put down whatever it is if we need to and talk to each other. It’s not perfect but it works for us.

I had Receiver-In-Canal (RIC) hearing aids with the processor that sits behind the ear.  Because I also wear glasses and hats, my ears would hurt by early evening.  After 3 years, I purchased In-The-Canal (ITC) hearing aids which I can wear comfortably from the time I get up to the time I go to bed.  The hearing aids I purchased look like ear buds, but are much more comfortable.  They are the Signia Active Pro IX with rechargeable batteries that last up to 34 hours on a charge.  Just pop them in the charger before I go to sleep and they are ready the next morning when I wake up.

Listening fatigue is a thing. Imagine someone holding a microphone up to your ears. 
Everything is amplified. It can cause sensory overload. 

Have you thought about different types of communication?

So my thoughts here are about how exhausting hearing loss is. I’m 38 and lost my hearing this year. And for the first half of this year, I GET IT. The brain is consistently working twice as much because we are looking for visual cues as well as trying to decipher the words being said, place them in a sentence that makes sense, hope that is the sentence you are saying and do it in a split second because there is another word coming right after. This is exhausting after 8 hours. With a hearing aid it’s supposed to be better but no it’s just louder. So small sounds become more prominent than they should be and voices are just as muffled as they were just louder. Which helps… but that help only extends so far. With hearing aids they don’t improve your hearing, they amplify to reach the depths of where you can hear. 

I think that he wore his hearing aids for your birthday dinner is because he does value you and for that night he had to put your need out front and show you that. Maybe it’s lip service for your birthday but in that he did that at all tells me he values you and wanted to show you preference. I don’t know how old he is but I know the mental toll hearing loss can inflict and I’m sorry you have to bear with it. But I think trying to understand him and commiserating with the fragility of his condition could end up going a long way so that he feels seen so you can be heard, if that makes any sense. He is older I’m guessing, not a lot of capacity for putting his feelings into words, so his anger is getting displaced lashing out at you. No one likes to feel like they are getting older or frail both things hearing aids make you feel and exacerbated by the exhaustion hearing loss brings with it. But he should not be taking it out on you. There is no excuse for that. 

Until I went to an audiologist with my wife she didn’t really understand what I was going through. It’s something that unless it’s happening to you it’s really hard to put into words. I do understand how badly you miss that connection and I understand how desperate and unseen that can make you feel. But it’s something he can’t control. Even with hearing aids he can’t control it. Hang in there. He has a lot of pride but he’s always had that I’d wager. You’ll get more flies with honey than earwax.

Have you talked with the professionals who set up his hearing aids and let them know that hes just feeling too loud? They should be able to adjust the hearing aids to his comfort level. Better ywt, does he have a remote control app to do that himself? Listening fatigue is a real thing that on nights im home alone, as soon as im home, shoes off, bra off then ears off.

Coming home and taking off your HAs after a long day of listening is like coming home and taking off your tight shoes (or your bra🤣)
It’s good to just sit in a little bubble of quiet. 
Could you ask him to perhaps wear his HAs during your sit down dinner time each night so you can really talk to each other, even though it might only be half an hour. Or perhaps even 2/3 times a week. It might be a good compromise.

I echo what others have said. It may also be that if he finds certain sounds piercing still, then he could have the settings looked at, have them adjusted slightly, or create a new ‘home’ setting that works to reduce loud noises but still provide a better hearing opportunity compared to not wearing them.

I feel if you don’t wear them all the time you don’t really learn how to hear properly through them as your own ears, therefore fuelling the issue some more.

Hearing fatigue is defo a thing though. It’s knackering.

I completely get why you're frustrated. It sounds like he hasn't quite adapted to being HOH just yet, and for hearing people, this can be a bit of an identity struggle... even a decade long one! My son is deaf and wears bilateral cochlear implants and I encourage him to have time in the house without them on, as listening  fatigue is very, very real and can be extremely draining. That being said, I think there's room for compromise in communication methods and expectations. When I need to get my son's attention, I flicker the lights or tap him. Sometimes I throw something small in his direction and we get a good chuckle out of it (keep in mind, my son is a teenager so he finds it funny lol not sure how a grown man would feel or how playful he is). It may be less frustrating for both of you if you don't have to shout repeatedly to get his attention. If it's important or urgent, write a note. He may be stubbornly resisting adapting to new strategies, but theres lots of little things you can do to start. There's a chance he'll adjust better to you just making the adjustments vs. you telling him to make them. If he isn't willing to learn ASL fully, try starting with a handful of signs to use around the house and just start using them when theres a need for it. He'll catch on. Ultimately, it'll make things easier on him too. Hearing people's lives kind of revolve around talking and so it just sounds like you both have to figure out ways to continue to connect with a bit less of it. There is a happy medium here somewhere! Best of luck to you.

A speech to text app helps a whole awful lot, but I swear the thing they subscribe to hates me specifically, it does a pretty good job for other voices though.

iPhone has a standard accessibility feature that does speech to text, which is what I use when their phone isn’t out.  I think google has a live transcribe thing that’s also free.

He needs to have a dead guy-to-other-deaf-guy conversation. If he’s either syracuse/roch area or chicago area, i could chat with him because maybe he needs to see for himself through other deaf guys who has have successful relationships and unsuccessful conversations as a Deaf male if that makes sense

My HoH husband doesn’t wear his hardly at all. I am an RN and appreciate all of these comments. 
His doctor has told him many times that studies show a link between not wearing HA and dementia. He still is not consistent. It’s only since our kids have said something that he is wearing them. If your husband is wearing them 8 hours a day he is reducing his risk for dementia. Maybe letting him know how he is helping his health longterm by doing that and how grateful you are for that. Maybe think about a compromise  that would work for you both weekends maybe to start. I sure wish my husband was wearing his 8 hours a day. But  I feel your pain.

It takes time to adjust to hearing aids. That may be some of the issue. But there also sounds like a problem with stubbornness and disrespect. It's one thing for him to have some downtime after work and have a break from them. It's another to never wear them when around you and to be rude about it. He knows he can't hear you. That should bother him and he should want to correct that. I'd see if he's willing to go to marriage counseling.

Those reactions to random acute noise are not uncommon. I’m sure you could figure out how to be quieter. It’s not just clanging, it’s crushed ice, too, and incredibly difficult to not be constantly barraged by these. 

In restaurants it’s a mix of that and the din from conversations. In conversation with people it’s extremely taxing and frustrating for both sides. It’s not the “settings” or “need a new HA,” it’s just the lack of experience and adaptation of different communication strategies. 

I don’t find aids uncomfortable but we do like to clear out brains after an aural assault. And, if in conversation, give us some time to change settings because of nuances in settings. Automatic settings sometimes need to be overridden for situations but you need to think of aids being like dial up internet and not instantaneous like the rest of our electronics. (Phonak Virto P70 wearer here). And while it was a top model a few years ago its replacement isn’t going to be magically different. And , it isn’t easy to casually pop $5k down for a new pair. 

My aids work much better streaming content than having them amplify the tv, cellphone, computer in the presence of the din and we can have the response tailored for that mode but just because you can get our attention we still need to change a setting. 

It’s not like you think. 

I say repeatedly if l heard as well as I see without glasses it’d be amazing but sadly it isn’t. It’s a very fatiguing condition. 

Look at restaurants attributes that make it hard, proximity to the kitchen, reflective surfaces, and other sounds. You may need to eat at less popular and lively restaurants. And he may just need a pair of hearing aids with the features. 

Ask about what the situations sound and feel like too. 

Sorry if this isn’t helpful

Has he seen an audiologist recently for a hearing aid tune up? Or to see if he’s eligible for a new set?

I get it and sometimes need to take it off for an hour especially if the noise been loud. That being said, if he finds certain noises piercing, he can go to the audiologist and them them adjust it. The beauty of digital hearing aids is that they’re so programmable to adjust to different sounds. I had to do that a couple of times and now it’s not as bad.  Do I have the odd days where I literally cannot wear it?  Sure but I make sure to communicate with my family so they’re aware and I still try to get involved even if it’s a few words or animated hands and a few signs (I only know a few but we choose the common ones when needed). Your husband needs to make an effort.  

Tell him to see that audiologist to adjust the programming. Also have him consider taking them off at work at lunchtime. It can be the breather that he needs.  I do that on occasion and it helps me get through evenings because my ear is not done by end of day.

i can definitely sympathize with him. i struggle just to wear my 1 hearing aid a full day at work because some noises can be too much, everything can be over stimulating. Taking it out when i get home is comparable to the sweet relief of taking a bra off after a long day 😂 i don't live with my partner yet but i do know it can be frustrating for him at times when he is trying to tell me something and either i straight up don't hear him or misheard what he said. When we move in together i do plan on wearing it more at home, though like another user said i might have my deaf times where i just need a break. 

He sounds salty about having to get hearing aids. i dont know if it's directly because of you saying he needed them, if he's embarrassed by them like it's emasculating or something. like there's nothing wrong with having them. You could try having a discussion about your frustrations but also be clear that he can also vent his frustrations as well just so it doesn't seem accusatory or laying all the blame on him. this is if he is willing to talk about it in the first place.

I am the same way. However, I only wear one hearing aid. I only feel the need for it when I am in a different environment to where I actually struggle bad with hearing people. Places like work, a loud restaurant, or going in public etc. I view home as a quiet place, especially after I’ve been at work all day.

It gets better with time. He needs to wear at least 8 hours a day. Eventually he should use all day every day until he goes to sleep. Hearing aids not only help you hear; they help stave off dementia as well..

I think this is very normal, I’ve worn hearing aids since I was 4 and only for about the first couple years did I wear them 24/7. Taking your hearing aids out can feel similar to taking your bra off. My parents always fought with me over this, even took me to the audiologist one time and she made me feel so horrible about my decision that she made me cry. It’s hard for me to see the other side, since I’m someone who’s in your husband’s shoes, but I can definitely tell understand how it could be frustrating. Especially when the person is getting angry at you for them not being able to hear, which I am guilty of as well. I always need to take a step away and reflect when I start getting angry. One suggestion I have is maybe you guys could learn ASL together. It’s actually super fun, and that way if he can’t hear you, you can easily communicate in a different way. I think it’s great though that you’re trying to learn about things from his point of view and trying to find solutions to make communicating easier

I hate my hearing aids as well. It’s really hard especially because the noises do pierce my ears and the more noise there is the worse it is. They personally make my ears itch a lot. Also it’s mentally exhausting. So I very much understand him on that. It’s hard for hearing people to understand the full struggles of someone who is hard of hearing. I hate talking. Especially when people can’t hear me because I think I’m being really loud. It’s just frustrating. 

I have the opposite problem on that my husband isn’t really learning sign language for me. I think it’s very normal in a lot of cases. I don’t think it’s personal towards you.

Yeah make sure he can see you when you talk so he can lipread. Hearing aids are unnatural and uncomfortable. It takes compromise from both partners. But as a HOH individual, I must say respectfully, I don’t owe anyone to wear MY hearing aids (emphasis on MINE. My tool for my purpose when I choose). If you want to be heard, “speak the language” of the listener. It is the responsibility of the speaker to be heard, not the listener to listen. Good luck. Not easy. Sorry for the struggle. I sympathize.

I have bilateral moderate to severe hearing loss and can completely identify with not wanting to wear hearing aids any more than he has to, BUT i did learn sign language and absolutely love it. For me, it's far as superior to wearing hearing aids in so many situations.  I don’t have any solutions to offer, but I hope you find one that works for both of you!

As someone hard of hearing. Who also barely wears his hearing aids, try and give a little grace. 


I find them exhausting. They kill my ears. Sounds rattle my brain. Is rather just not be able to hear.

I can see how you are frustrated from this. But hearing fatigue is REAL. I had access to hearing aids for a week after I got my hearing tested and was exhausted after work. Like fell asleep for a three hour nap.

Maybe offer him an hour or two hearing break. And while he has his break do the chores he can’t stand while his hearing aids are in or have him do them.

As someone who is hard of hearing, I can hear you but the understanding is what I am lacking. For example this morning my brother had said something I at first thought was highly inappropriate, but I asked him to repeat himself and he had asked me something not even remotely close to what I thought he said at first. So instead of asking if he heard you, ask if he understood.

As a deaf person, you should do some research on listening/hearing fatigue, when you have hearing loss and wear hearing aids it takes so much extra effort to decipher every word someone says and they don’t fix the loss they just aid it and for some not very well so I’d say maybe try to have more patience for it.

As for the blaming each other for loss and arguing who the blame is on it’s on neither of you. It isn’t his fault that his ears aren’t working and it isn’t your fault neither but him lashing out at you for it sounds as if maybe he’s deflecting and isn’t coping as well with his loss? Therapy, counselling, groups to relate with and other things to support him are all pretty easily available so this could potentially be a good way of getting through it?

I think with him not ‘wanting’ to hear you might really be that he does want to hear you but just can’t wrap his head around it being hearing you through a new and unnatural way; it isn’t fair on you at all to be left dangling

For me in my house me and my mum have a compromise of that if we are in the same room and eating/talking with each other I wear my hearing devices but if I have them off and am just watching tv or doing dishes or something I keep them off so I can have my listening breaks and not be too fatigued, maybe you guys could have a conversation to figure out a way that works for you? I hope everything works out well for you :))

I do wonder if counseling would be helpful like others have suggested. I wear bilateral hearing aids and find the noise of the world that I adjusted to not hearing (or mostly hearing less of the intensity) for most of my life, so I generally only wear mine to work or certain settings like group dinners out. It can be very mentally taxing, because we can't ""passively"" listen the way other people can. I find it concerning that he doesn't want to try learning sign language with you though, hence why the counseling could maybe assist in this and finding a way to make it work or find the root problem. My preferred language is ASL and for me, a partner has to be willing to learn and utilize it at home because I don't want to have the burden of being the ""bridge"" in the communication 24/7. It sounds like you're trying really hard to find ways to help your relationship adapt and empathize, and I'm so sorry you're left feeling like he doesn't want to hear you at all. If he refuses counseling, individual counseling to figure out what *you* want going forward might be of benefit too. Your needs in the relationship are not less important than his.

My husband is the same way, but we are retired and he has never been one who likes to chat.  A very stubborn man, he can't hear smoke alarms, or loud bumps like if the refrigerator falls over.  I fell in the shower (and got a concussion), I couldn't get up...and he couldn't hear my cries, but he treated me like an angel for weeks after!   He can't hear me if I am just in the next room, and he lets me know by yelling ""I can't hearrrrr you!""  So I have to stop what I am doing and go to where he is. We have been married 45 years and have worked most things out.  I try not to say ""never mind"" because it sounds rude, but I explained if I say that it's because it really isn't worth repeating, and if it was anything important I make sure he heard me and repeat it.  On the other hand, if I do want to chat, it is now a habit to tap his knee or shoulder to get his attention so we can be face to face.  He is pretty patient most of the time but does occasionally get cranky.  We both remind each other we made vows 45 years ago ""in sickness or in health"".  Best of luck to both of you!

Was he not HH when you met? Why did you marry an HH person if it was going to be so frustrating for you? This post reads so hostile to me. It would hurt my heart if my partner spoke about my lack of hearing this way. 

My suggestion is find another way to communicate (like texting, for example) or find a partner who doesn't have a disability that inconveniences you.",2025-09-25 01:05:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nptgv1/married_to_hoh_husband_who_wont_wear_hearing_aids/

Hi there!  I was born almost deaf in my right ear.  

Would some kind of insurance cover hearing aids for you?  They might help even if your hearing in the other ear is typical.

Usually your county or state will offer early intervention for children with diagnosed hearing loss or hard of hearing. It’s completely free. I would look into that

Lifeprint.com is a really great resource for getting started. I became deaf as an adult in college and this is what me and my family/friends used to learn ASL.

We connected with a local organization for deaf and hard of hearing and we were assigned a deaf mentor to help us and our son learn ASL and access other resources. They were super helpful because it was more focused on what we would need for a child. We also use the Lingvano app as a supplemental tool to work more on our own

Depending on the size of the city you live in, there may be a local, regional, or state organization that offers free or reduced cost classes in ASL for family members of deaf/HoH people (look for: schools for the deaf, ""speech and hearing"" or ""resource center"" organizations, by-Deaf-for-Deaf organizations, public libraries, etc). 

If possible, try to learn from a Deaf teacher in in-person classes (zoom as a second choice; basically any way you can get direct feedback on your signing from the teacher) and avoid anything with Alexander Graham Bell's name on it (these orgs tend to promote speech-only or speech-primary modalities which are simply not very effective). 

It's absolutely wonderful that you're taking this step! You may get some pushback from old-school audiologists and teachers, if your child is HoH, but hold strong: a fully accessible language is better than half-grasping an inaccessible language. Luckily, it seems attitudes on ASL vs oralism are changing, and more hearing people than ever know ASL. 

Good luck!

It’s best to google classes in your area for accurate results.




































Edit:spelling

Hard over to r/asl. Theres a pinned post with resources. Also consider r/podc (parent of deaf child)

The community colleges around me all offer ASL classes to those in the community; maybe check there?

Try not to overwhelm yourself with learning ALL THE ASL ALL AT ONCE! Learn signs for her routines (bath, eat, sleep, play, etc) and environment (favorite toys, pets, car, home) and build from there.

Highly recommend Baby Signing Time with Rachel Coleman.  It’s a great starting point for you and your family.  There is an enormous amount of material in her “My Signing Time” series.   You will be so amazed how quickly you and your child will pick it up.  I wish you luck on your journey!",2025-09-24 14:31:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1npdp47/6_months_daughter_might_be_hard_of_hearing/
1nojlph,hardofhearing,How to let people on bikes know I can’t hear them?,"I have mild hearing loss in my right ear and I recently moved to the city and encountered a new problem- when people are approaching me from behind and on my right on a bike, especially if there’s a lot of ambient noise, I can’t hear them. I’ve had a few close calls already, but today someone hit my side (I’m fine, just a few bruises), which sort of made me realize I need to find a solution before something really awful happens. Any ideas?

I am always looking around.

Are you on foot, or also on a bike?

While pedaling, I find these [Bike Bar End Mirrors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092QKJNPM?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1) very helpful to see when someone is coming up on me.

My beloved wants me to wear a t-shirt that says ""HARD OF HEARING"" or ""DEAF"", but I cannot bring my self to self-label as defective.

I don’t trust people to not take advantage of that. I’ve seen too many cases of people enjoying hitting cyclists. In my opinion, they may target you and use your hearing loss as a way to pin it on you. I recommend you attach a mirror to your handle bar so you are able to see behind you.

Edit: just realized you are not on the bike but rather a pedestrian. Keep looking around when walking. Wearing ID can still make you a target sadly.

You could install mirrors on your handlebar so you can see from behind or you can use this [sign](https://www.worldwidevisible.com/nl/limited-hearing-bordje/a3468) to let other people know that you can’t hear them. I’m not sure if the website ships to countries other than the Netherlands or maybe it’s available on Amazon or such.

Edit: it seems they will only ship to Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands.

In the US, it's most common (and preferred) to pass on the left. This is as true on bicycle and multi-use paths as it is on the road.

If you're also in the US, I suggest deliberately positioning yourself nearer the right side of the trail.  This should encourage bikers to pass you on both your hearing side *and* to pass you in the correct fashion.

I do this and have never had a problem with cyclists unpredictably passing me in a manner where I can't tell which side to duck over to.

You need to be aware of/avoid common bike paths, look over your shoulder regularly, and perhaps keep to the very edge of the path. I know it sucks, I also have to accommodate my disabled self to an unforgiving world, but realistically that’s what we have to do. Honestly I would suggest posting in cycling forums and see what they recommend. They have as much right to the space as you (obviously not to the point of colliding with you).

I'm hard of hearing - consider adding a mirror! Seeing something coming from behind is better than nothing.

Do you have mirrors? That would at least help with seeing them, even if you can’t hear them. I just used a bike with nice, big mirrors for the first time and the difference is huge.

Edit: ugh, just saw you’re on foot, not on bike. My only thought would be a jacket that says DEAF or HARD OF HEARING in huge letters on the back. Which I would hate to do because I would feel like it puts a target on my back…

There’s gotta be some way you can use a mirror on foot too

I have a yellow vest that says DEAF on the back that I wear while biking. Even when I wear my hearing aids while on the bike, I'm pretty much deaf with the wind in my ears. I cannot hear people yell out behind me. Since I started wearing my vest, people pass me more cautiously and respectfully. No near misses.

Likely not your fault you got hit and I don’t mean to blame the victim, but as a HoH cyclist I’ve got to tell you that some pedestrians are complete fucking idiots. Be predictable. Especially on MUTs, walk like you’re driving, on the right. Expect people to pass on the left. If you’re walking with a dog, keep the dog on your right and never use an extendy leash.

1no3t9y,hardofhearing,Opinions on live sports closed captioning,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for opinions on **live sports closed captioning** and how it can be made better, especially in big leagues like the **NHL, NFL, and NBA**.

Some questions I’d love your thoughts on:

* What do you think is **good** about sports captioning right now?
* What do you think is **bad** or frustrating about it?
* What would make captioning for live sports **better**?

For people who are **Deaf, Hard-of-Hearing, or low-literacy**, I’d especially like your perspective:

* What type of captions work best for you? Do you want **everything** announcers say shown on screen?
* Would a **shorter, paraphrased version** be more helpful?
* Or would captions focused mainly on **play-by-play commentary** (just what’s happening in the game) work better than including all the side talk and analysis?

Your input would be really valuable. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

[댓글]
Closed caption by definition should be exactly the audio that hearing people hear. So it should transcribe the announcers exactly. 

Paraphrasing or play by play would not be closed captioning.

For me I want everything announcers are saying shown on the screen, but high enough or away from the play action on the tv. It’s frustrating when I can’t see the play because captions blocked it. I just turn the captions off and watch the game but it’s annoying when they are discussing an important call, a challenge, etc.

I want everything announcers say shown on screen. Like another commenter said, the main issue is when the captions block important things on the screen. For live sports the screen is packed with things I want to read, so it would be nice to put captions in a thoughtful spot by default. 



Why are you grouping ""low-literacy"" in with deaf and hoh? I can read and see just fine

What is the purpose of these questions? Is it homework? Research? Avoiding paying accessibility consultants?

1nn5jzx,hardofhearing,"Should I adapt more, or should work adapt too?","Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for some advice and outside perspective.

I’m hard of hearing (deaf in one ear, cochlear implant on the left, and a hearing aid on the right). I’ve been working at the same company for 11 years. From a technical standpoint, I believe I do well at my job—I know my craft, deliver results, and have built a lot of experience.

But I’ve consistently been told I’m “missing the leadership part.” Because of my hearing, meetings and fast-paced discussions are hard for me, and that’s often where leadership and visibility get judged. Recently, my boss suggested I should start considering another position, since my growth has been stalled and so is my salary.

So here’s my question:  
Is it fair to expect that I should completely adapt to the environment, or should it be a two-way effort where the workplace also adapts to me (with accommodations, understanding, etc.)?

I personally believe growth should be a two-party effort—but after 11 years with no real career progression, I’m questioning whether I’m being unrealistic.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

[댓글]
Where do you live? That goes a long way to determining what accommodations your employer is legally obligated to provide.

Are there any accomodations that would allow you to better participate in those meetings? If your career is stalled at this company, why not start applying to others? Unless you want this other position they're asking about.

I’m in a similar situation. I have two Roger table mics, but would need four. The responsible authority just rejected my well written application claiming that ”I should hear 15-20 people”. I asked for more interpreting (right now I get a meeting every other week or so) in December 2023, and still haven’t got it. The application system is complicated and inconvenient for the employer. Just the previous week, I faded to deal with this kind of issues:

* A big event that I actually had interpreters for was moved with short notice, and I lost the opportunity to get to know our new organisation.

* I couldn’t hear a lecture/presentation at that event, but they sent us an… untranscribed voice recording of the presentation.

* I received an uncaptioned video about our new organisation.

* we’re moving to new office space, that is more open than the one we currently have with no good options for where to place me from a hearing perspective.

* We had visitors from abroad, and I wanted interpreters for the lunch. I couldn’t get that, since our interpreters don’t do English. Normally, the booking agency contacts freelancers who are comfortable with English, but we only have a limited number of interpreters who are authorized to access our facilities.

And that’s just the last week. Of course it’s exhausting to just get somehow get the information I need for work. My team is absolutely brilliant, I have a quite good education, so I do get appreciated a lot for my work. Nonetheless, how on earth should we to actually improve communication in a way that makes a difference?

It also doesn’t help that younger generations talk so very fast.

Do you want to progress and take on more leadership?

I tried it and hated dealing with management/HR, so stepped back down to my technical role. 

Companies should accept that some people are happy in their jobs and just let them do the work. The constant need for 'more' doesn't apply to everyone.

This would be done so through different vibration patterns on the user's skin. It's a bit similar to some other tentative inventions such as the Neosensory or the University of Washington's Soundwatch.

1nmqcdk,hardofhearing,The easiest help you can give today,"Hey everyone. First off, I'm sorry if this isn't allowed here. I'm not very versed in Reddit etiquette.

My name is Jason. I've been a carpenter for the past twelve years. I injured my back at work in August 2023 and had to get a spinal fusion. I'm just now getting back to work after blowing through my savings, dealing with complications from the surgery.

At my lowest, I met an amazing girl (Amy) who was also at her lowest. Her husband had died from ALS the year prior and her children were taken away by CPS since she is deaf and unemployed. She was left with nothing, because what was left was taken by the children's grandmother, who now has custody of the kids. 

She was born deaf in China and abandoned as a baby. She was raised in orphanages until she was adopted at the age of 6 by a woman in the US. She's a tiny 4'10"" petite girl with many stories of near abductions and... worse. She's lived a rough life, but she is absolutely amazing on some ""Hear no evil, speak no evil"" type shit. I'm doing everything I can to help her because she deserves it.

So... being deaf and only having a high school education, her options for employment are very limited. She's working with the government program to find a job, but that doesn't seem to be going too well. On top of that, her food stamps got cut. I'm currently supporting her and I can barely support myself right now.

She's incredibly talented and spends all of her free time designing clothing, crocheting, doing hair/makeup/nails, making tutorials videos and editing and uploading to all the socials. She's a hard worker, but she only has 20ish followers. She does her videos with ASL, but she never added any sound, so it would just be quiet and you'd hear a fan or the chair squeaking.

I'm trying to help her with all of this, but I'm just a dumb carpenter with like 12 friends on my socials. I don't know the first thing about gaining followers and I don't really want any... but Amy could really use some. Every follower or view she gets, she comes to me so proud to show me. In my eyes, she's incredibly talented and makes some amazing clothing. --( Possibly NSFW content)-- Check her clothes out on IG @RaverSecrets and her makeup @DeathByMakeup. She's also got TikTok and Pinterest and everything else. Search RaverSecrets and also check out her Shopify store at www.RaverSecrets.com

Please keep the comments clean. Though the clothing is risque and Amy loves modeling it, she is a very sort of sheltered girl. She doesn't do OF or anything and... well, she shows me all the creepy messages she gets from people online and it breaks my heart that she has to deal with that.

TLDR- Deaf girl needs help. Follow @RaverSecrets on Instagram. If anyone wants to collaborate or is local to the DMV, hit me up.

Jason, you’re doing a lot right already. Biggest wins for Amy will be adding captions to every video, posting short clips regularly, and tagging deaf/ASL creator communities so her stuff reaches the right people. Protect both of your boundaries, keep it consistent, and let the growth come slow but steady. Respect for what you’re doing, man.",2025-09-21 12:12:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nmqcdk/the_easiest_help_you_can_give_today/
1nmdj5m,hardofhearing,I think I listen to music differently than hearing people,"Hello I wanted to make this post to see if anyone else feels this way? I am male(15), hard of hearing and whenever I listen to music I just can’t make out what the lyrics are. Recently I’ve realized it’s obviously because of my hearing loss. I’ve always connected with more instrumental music and with more of the “vibe” of a song rather than its lyrics. When I listen to music I tend to block out the lyrics and focus on the background music and the instrumental part of songs. My best friend likes to listen to more rap or songs focused around lyrics and when I listen to their songs I can’t ever really tell what is being said because it’s either to fast or the words kinda just mumble together. When I look up the lyrics and memorize them then the words start to form better in my head and I’m able to decipher what was said but without that I have no clue. So I’m just wondering if anyone else connects with more ethereal, indie, spiritual music like I do because of there hearing loss? 

[댓글]
Same, lyrics have always been pretty secondary to me.

My taste in music has definitely changed with the progression of my hearing loss. Also more into instrumental genre. Perhaps what you call ethereal is what vocal trance is to me, with lyrics but the music is what defines the listening experience, not the lyrics.

Yes I have the same problem

Yup me too, listening to music without lyrics even in my native language is hard. However, I enjoy good writing so I always listening while reading lyrics on google because spotify usually don't have the lyrics

Yeah, I’ve never paid attention to lyrics. I’m amazed that people can decipher what’s being said, but like you, I’ve met people who were equally amazed I don’t pay them any attention unless I look them up.

I do tend to listen to a lot of music from different cultures - maybe because it doesn’t bother me that I don’t understand them.

This is exactly the same for me too!

I miss the CDs that came with a lyrics sheet because I loved learning them, following along with those as a kid/ teen. I actually always loved to sing along but didn't always sing actual words for the whole song, sort of just a sound that I heard if that makes sense, I'm embarrassed now lol. I never wore my hearing aides that I was always supposed to wear, as I wasn't forced to, only asked lol. I started to wear them in my 20s. I'm now 40. And still can't really hear a lot of song lyrics. I recently discovered that on Spotify they have a lyrics section that often has the lyrics, or you can add them yourself from a website. I recently started to actually learn The Dead Kennedys lyrics and have fallen in love woth them even more.

Same here, i don’t ‘ hear’ them as part of the song, only the music, unless it’s like a really obvious and catchy chorus.

I was in my 30s before I heard the actual melody of the theme music from *The Price is Right.* Before that, I always thought the melody was in the bass guitar.

I can't hear lyrics either.

I like music that has structure that I can piece together slowly.

I'm very musical person and I can read sheet music and for classical music I will read along and sometimes I will be shocked to see there's an entire extra voice like a quiet flute or xylophone I can't hear at all.  

When I watch music be played live it's the same thing.  I'll see someone playing the flute and only then will I  become aware it's very slightly there in the background.  A hearing person could likely hear it distinctly.

I'm very fond of the music of Steve Reich.  He takes the parts of his compositions and slowly phases them between the instruments and the result is you hear all the parts of the music at different times, slowly changing over time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXJWO2FQ16c (feel free to fast forward to about 5 minutes and then 20 minutes if you're the impatient type)

100% same, I never listen to lyrics and go solely on the 'vibe' from the instrumentals + melody. It's particularly funny when I send friends songs and I'm like - oh this is very soothing and mellow... and my friend goes oh its so sad didnt you hear the lyrics??? haha

I started losing my hearing around age 20 (otosclerosis). As a teen I loved lyrics, but as my hearing went the words in most sounds became jibberish and I started leaning towards instrumental music. 


I still listen to folk music and whatever songs have clear lyrics, but most song lyrics are mutilated by my bad hearing and my brain mishearing.

I quit listening to music for several years after I lost part of my hearing because I couldn’t make out the lyrics. About ten years ago, I finally realized I can listen to the music that the words make just like any other musical instrument. 

It was fun trying to guess what the lyrics were. Huey Lewis’ “It’s Hip to Be Square” came through as “If My Hips Could Be Square”.

After all, I enjoy classical music, and opera, even though I don’t understand Italian!

Slightly different experience, but what you said about reading the lyrics and listening to words reminded me. I have had progressive hearing loss due to Meniere's disease, but each time I lose hearing I go back and listen to a playlist of familiar music. Each time I have relearn how words and sounds sound again, and I use familiar songs to do that. Often after an episode of hearing loss I will only be able to pick the song after it's about a third of the way through, like when the chorus kicks in, and then I will tune into it and use my memory to help remap the sounds and words. That said, as my hearing loss has progressed, there are songs that simply don't sound as good anymore. The high frequency samples are gone, or it just sounds flat and disappointing, because I can remember the richness of the sounds that used to be there. So when I lost more hearing in June this year, I immediately asked my partner to buy a subwoofer for our bedroom. We have a 36"" subwoofer in our lounge room, and now I wanted a small sub for the bedroom. If I couldn't hear the high frequencies anymore, at least I can FEEL soul crushing bass, and that can't be taken away !

1nm9nrw,hardofhearing,new iOS 26 captions engine,"A few months ago Apple announced new SpeechAnalyzer API to replace SFSpeechRecognizer that launched in iOS 10.

I'm hearing, but my partner is HoH and so I immediately began playing around with the new API on iOS 26 dev beta. The difference was staggering just using the built in phone mic, and picking up correct words from distance seemed vastly improved. It's all on device as well. I built an app using the new API for my partner and she finds it actually useful now.

I wanted to do a simple side by side test so used this same short audio passage on both phones:

&gt;*“The stale smell of old beer lingers. It takes heat to bring out the odor. A cold dip restores health and zest. A salt pickle tastes fine with ham. Tacos al pastor are my favorite. A zestful food is the hot cross bun.”*

[Top: iOS 26 on left \(iPhone 16 Pro\) vs iOS 18 \(SE 2\). Bottom: My app \(Hearing Buddy\) using new API.](https://preview.redd.it/ga0l1n9cwdqf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a60e641925dcb71c89a683b377b6c1f1011858)

iOS 26 got it 100% correct, while the older model on iOS 18 had only a \~74.4% accuracy.

If anyone is using a paid captions app, you might find this new default free model from Apple is just as good now as the ""pro captions"" offered from those apps.

I can't say everything in 26 is an upgrade, the new glass UI takes some getting used too for sure, but this seems like a clear improvement.

1nm1959,hardofhearing,Is not getting a hearing aid if you're HOH in only one ear really that bad?,"I've (F 57) recently been diagnosed with “mild-to-moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss”, so I'm half deaf in one ear. 
I have heard it is important to not delay getting hearing aids for        
— the social reasons:  not avoiding activities, not being socially isolated, being able to follow conversations, etc        
— and the brain reasons: keeping the neurones which would receive the signals from the ear stimulated so they don't atrophy or get reallocated,  keeping the brain stimulated in general, thus reducing the chance of cognitive decay and dementia. The lack of social interaction is also a factor in this. 

Well that's what my audiologist says and what I have read online about getting two hearing aids. 

(As is probably obvious by now I'm not an audiologist or other health professional. Apologies if I've used incorrect terminology.)

I have found it difficult to find anything online from a reputable site about the consequences of delaying or not getting a hearing aid when the only significant hearing loss is in one ear for an adult. Almost everything online is about both ears or about children or babies. 

I mentioned my condition and my plan to get a hearing aid to an aunt, Helen (F 82, no blood relation) who has been partly deaf in one ear most of her adult life but never got hearing aids.  She said that the only reason for cognitive delay was missing out of social interaction, rather than the brain not getting stimulated by signals from the affected ear. She also said that since I had one good ear than I'd be fine. 

Hmm. Did what Helen say make any sense?  I suspect her view is based on cognitive dissonance becaise she never got a hearing aid herself. 

Does anyone have any information specifically on the risks of delaying getting a hearing aid when you only have one ear affected? 



[댓글]
I have perfect hearing in one ear and moderate to severe hearing loss in the other, getting a hearing aid has helped me thus far. Got one in July. I can definitely tell a big difference when its in or not.

Hearing in stereo is important to me.
It drives me nuts when my name is called and I can't tell by the sound which way to turn.

It made a huge difference for me. I have slight hearing loss in one ear and was mostly deaf in the other (I had surgery to correct it this year). I had to save to buy myself a hearing aid because insurance wouldn't cover the cost since I could still hear fine on one side. About 5 years after I was told I qualified for a hearing aid I finally got one. It wasn't perfect, but I hadn't realized how much I was missing. 


It took a while for me to relearn how to hear on my bad side. It was mentally exhausting and took me a few weeks to adjust to wearing the hearing aid all day without feeling overwhelmed.  Once I adjusted I was very glad to have  better hearing.

No, it‘s not.

If you want to, you can try a hearing aid and see for yourself, if it provides any acoustic advantage for you in daily listening environments. I would even recommend to try one. But if you don‘t want to, that‘s absolutely fine and no risk factor for dementia whatsoever.

I have profound loss in one ear, nearly perfect hearing in the other. I’ve been hard of hearing since 18 months old. I didn’t get hearing aids until my mid 20s and I personally love them. I use a CROS system.

Because of the type of hearing loss I have, my only option for hearing aids was the bone implanted one. I couldn't accept an unnecessary surgery, nor the potential side effects such as my body rejecting the implant. So I choose to live with my deaf ear, and do my best to protect what hearing I have left in my good one. 

I am of the opinion that hearing aids are a personal choice. If you choose to wear them, that's awesome. If you don't, then that's just fine too. I don't have much information about the medical risks of foregoing the hearing aid, unfortunately. But everything in life comes with a risk and we must choose which risks are worth it for ourselves.

Similar situation 47F hoh on one side, no loss on the other. ENT suggested ot was important to get a hearing aid so the ear keeps getting input..i have otosclerosis so maybe that matters. But honestly the little annoyance of the aid is worth it to just hear normally.

It’s never bad to not get a hearing aid.

I needed new hearing aids this year. I actually considered only getting one because I couldn’t hear anything with one ear. So why spend money on two aids if only one helped. My new audiologist told me she could get that ear to hear. She was right! I can actually hear with both ears now.

I rely on captions apps for school and work. Accuracy of the captions is proportional to the quality of the microphone and internet connection. It also depends on a favorable environment without background noise. The “real time” is a 3-10 second delay.

The cost isn’t scam level like Hearview, but I wonder how cheap it could be without the Ray-Ban name.

It should be mentioned that it only aids in communication one way. It gives the impression that what hearing people have to say is more important than Deaf voices.

Overall, they can be a helpful tool in the right situations, but they are far from giving actual accessibility.

Considering how poorly it performed during the demo I wouldn't hold my breath. Meta isn't good at making products, only buying already successful ones.

The limiting factor is typically the size/positioning of the (wearable) mic tbh. The tech has been there for years on the software end. There's a reason lapel, boom and shotgun mics are still used in film and tv. It's not because people enjoy holding something 6 inches above people's heads or people enjoy getting wired up.

Source: About to ship a STT app mainly using the same libraries Live Transcribe uses. Also was a musician.

I keep seeing so many different caption-glasses advertised lately. I want it it to be a thing, but just cant imagine its particularly good in the environments you actually need them in. Have they come a long way? Or still an overpriced gimmick for hearing people to play with?

Maybe it’ll help in 10 or so years, well after AI takes all our jobs. I don’t trust a word Zuckerberg says

I’m excited for these eventually working out the kinks; for now they seem to have the same hurdles that frustrate me with my HAs (eg tough to function in loud environments like bars and restaurants, needing to be facing the speaker for background noise reduction to really work, etc). I kind of equate them with the early days of flat screen TVs in terms of price and quality, as with time both improved. Definitely staying tuned though!

*I let my manager know at orientation and he said I’m fine and he will accommodate me if needed. I said I’ll let him know if I have any issues.

I worked drive through for over a decade with hearing aids. The headsets they had when I started did not play nice with the hearing aids I had at the time. It had only one headphone, so I would just take that hearing aid out and crank the headset up, which worked fine. Background noise is always going to be an issue in restaurants. Other people talking, dishes being done and getting slammed around, chatter from cooks, other registers, etc. It sounds like your aids help a lot, but there will be an adjustment period for sure til you get used to what it sounds like. Even the style of building is a factor, whether it's one of those big open rooms or just a normal height ceiling.   

I now work as tech support from home, so every day is packed full of phone calls. I found a solution with over the ear closed back headphones along with a strong headphone amp. The over ear phones don't make my hearing aids feedback, but just plugging them into the PC wasn't loud enough for me, so I started using the headphone amp which is great because I can just adjust the volume knob depending on call quality.  

I think you'll be just fine, but practice nice ways to ask people to repeat themselves, don't just say ""what?"" if you can't hear them.

I worked in retail and in a restaurant and had few issues. As long as I wasn’t making insane requests I was fine. My only limit with the restaurant was “I can’t answer phones with its loud because I’ll never be able to hear it over the customers” which was fine, I got to pick up the slack whenever it was quiet though

Congrats on your new job!! One thing I wish I did when I was younger and in my first few jobs was be transparent with my supervisor and let them know that I was HoH even if I thought I would be fine. 


I also suggest telling coworkers as needed which is what I did. Telling them I was HoH let them know “hey I’m not ignoring you” because I didn’t hear them or that my awkward laugh/chuckle was not because I’m laughing at them it’s because I probably didn’t hear what they said. 

Once I started owning my hearing loss in new environments around new people from the get-go instead of hiding it and pretending nothing was wrong (not saying you aren’t, just using my example), my confidence grew in all areas, not just working in customer service but in developing new friendships in some of those spaces as well.

Some customers are going to be dicks about you not hearing them. Hangry people tend to be ridiculous. 

I hope they won’t be able to get to you

i work in fast food too, at first i’ll admit it was harder, but i learned some things:

 1. memorize the menu board. so many times i can tell what a customer is going to order based off where on the menu they’re looking

2. talk with your hands- people are likely to mirror you, and if they see you moving your hands, they’re likely to make similar movements back. for example, when i ask “for here or for to go?”, i point to the counter/cash (here) or to the door (to go). people many times copy this, although subtle it helps so much. another example is when asking someone if they’d like a ftn drink or bottle, i’ll point to each, or when asking what size, i point to the different sizes we have and 80% of the time they’ll point to the one they’d like (works best if your store have the size options at the front counter)

3. if you’re not sure you got an order right, repeat it back to them when they’re done ordering (useful if you won’t have a screen on the other side so they can’t see) 

i doubt your store has this, but my store has a paper-sized copy of the menu for customers who can’t see very well. however, i’ll use this for when i really have a hard time understanding someone, i’ll have them point to the item they’d like and never had an issue with this

also, let your coworkers know, its important for  communication so they don’t think you’re ignoring them, or in worse case scenario they can help take the order (i’ve only had to do this once or twice, when someone had a thick, heavy accent) and all my coworkers were understanding

 lastly, advocate for yourself!! if someone has a mask, i ask them to lower it down to lipread, or if they’re uncomfortable doing so i ask them to speak clearer if possible. when someone is speaking too quietly, ask them to speak up, or what i do is quite obviously turn up my hearing aids. i know its quite stressful at first, but you’ll get adjusted in no time",2025-09-17 21:58:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njqkiz/have_you_worked_in_fast_food_customer_service/

Smart watch, with setting on vibration. Works better than anything I've tried.

Some phones, Samsung I know has it, have an accessibility feature that will alert you if it hears specific things that you task it with. Baby sounds is one of the options! I used this when my wife had to go out of town and I was worried that I wouldn't hear our little one.",2025-09-17 13:35:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njdcp5/alarm_device_suggestions/
1njcjzi,hardofhearing,Hearing person here. What might make HoH people struggle with hearing aids?,"Hello! I've been reading the posts here for a while to get some perspective on a problem a family member has been having. This is a question I'm asking in hopes of understanding and seeing if there's any accomodation the family can make to help her, but I know answering these kinds of questions can be exhausting, so please pardon me if I say something insulting or insensitive.

My girlfriend has an aunt who, in her 70s, is now struggling with hearing loss. The family has been able to buy her some hearing aids, but she just doesn't wear them. When asked about them, she just says she ""forgot to charge them"", or ""forgot to wear them"". If we ask her if there's any problem with the aids she answers that ""no, they're perfect!"", but still won't use them.

That wouldn't have been a problem, except that this person already seems to struggle a bit with some form of ADHD or neurodivergence. She lives on her own and takes care of most of her business, but there have been many occasions now in which she misunderstood some crucial information, or in which people have taken advantage of her struggle to comprehend things. The family is also afraid that she's getting some dementia symptons, but at this point, they don't know if it's the age or simply that she's not hearing things right. I think she got used to ""pretending"" she's hearing stuff, because she won't tell us when she doesn't understand things. It's posible she's embarassed about it.

I thought about all of us just learning sign language (LIBRAS, the one we use in Brazil), but I know she would just refuse, saying she's ""too old"" or ""too stupid"" for that. So I was thinking if there's any other way for us to help her keep being able to communicate with friends and family without the hearing aids or the sign language?

Or, if there is no other way, is there some accomodation that might make it easier for her to wear the aids? There's clearly something bothering her about them that she doesn't want to talk about or can't even articulate; is there anything you guys have struggled with that we might help make easier for her?

I ask this because she's clearly my girlfriend's favorite aunt, and it makes her sad that it's getting harder and harder for them to communicate.

Thank you in advance for any answers, and please tell me if I said something offensive.

Imagine a genie appears before you and messes with your ears and tells you you’ve been hearing things wrong for years and this is what the world really sounds like. And then the genie stuffs things in your ears that radically alters the sound of the world. And the world is LOUD. A cacophony of things you haven’t heard before. 

Your brain goes into overdrive trying to process all this. It can be a very difficult adjustment and really needs to be done with an audiologist. It took about 2 months for me to get my current HAs dialed in the way I like them.  And there’s no real way to do it without wearing them.

I started wearing hearing aids in my mid 40’s and it was a difficult adjustment for me. I was not used to hearing so many things (birds for instance) all of the time. I could only wear them for a few hours at first because I would feel exhausted after a short time. I gradually increased the amount of time until I was able to wear them all day at work. While hearing aids absolutely do help me hear things, the sound is not natural and louder noises can be very harsh and startling. I prefer receiving information in writing rather than verbally. What about texting (especially in a difficult environment)? For medical information, I ask my doctors to provide me with written information and instructions.

So many things 
Comfort wearing may be not wanting to draw attention to them 
If she’s wearing them and having a hard time it could be environmental. Trying to listen through the din of tv sets, machines running, other sounds is very taxing and distracting. 
We just don’t plug them in and magically things are great. If I heard as well as I could see without glasses I’d be doing backflips. 
Signing is an opportunity. I have an app and see that I could learn signing. Who in the family would she be communicating with? I’m not sure what value it adds. 
Hearing aids are great for streaming on your phone or a podcast but the response of the equipment to the environment is the issue. 
Let’s say I’m in a conversation with you. As we engage, someone nearby starts talking loudly or something is making noise in the kitchen. At that time we often cannot discern what you are saying because the HA is concentrating on that louder sound. Now we can change a setting. So imagine the conversation where I ask you to wait, I pick up my iPhone and hit the app and change the settings to screen out that noise. That might take 20 seconds or more. Now, okay let’s talk. 

So how does that dynamic change without the hearing aids I’m looking right at you to read your lips and other non verbal expressions. I’m not distracted by the loudmouth nearby or the noise in the kitchen. So that’s the alternative until you say something like why aren’t you wearing your hearing aids we’d be having so much of a better convo. 
So its pretty much which version of this sucks do I want to have today?

Rechargeable hearing aids don't last long, so that is problematic for anyone that is not diligent about keeping electronics charged. It could be that a hearing aid that takes disposable batteries would be a better fit for her.


I grew up with hearing aids so I'm used to them. People new to them after a lifetime of not having anything in their ear canal often struggle with the physical discomfort. Having a mold or hearing aid lodged in the ear is unnatural. Molds can also shrink or swell depending on the season, that has been very painful for me, so much so that I had my last pair made of acrylic and that has been a huge improvement for me. Another possibility there.


Then there's the discomfort of amplified sound.


Speech comprehension is important and hearing aids help with that. What most people don't realize is hearing aids amplify a lot of other sounds too, some sounds are really obnoxious like dogs barking. Certain pitches and tones are more painful than others. Even ""silence"" is vibrating the eardrums more than usual due to amplification, think refrigerator compressor, fans or AC humming. It's easy to get fatigued. 


If this is the issue, make sure her hearing aids has a comfort in noise or comfort with speech program to dial down background sounds and ensure that she knows how to change programs.


Some people disike it so much that they don't wear the hearing aid.


And then there's the whole identity thing, not wanting to identify as a person with a disability.


So far I've mostly shared conjecture to give some perspective.


Ideally your girfriend can share her concern and desire to connect and communicate.


Let the aunt be the lead on what to do about improving communication. Your girlfriend can gently ask if that's something the aunt wants to do.


Learning sign language is a huge undertaking. Keeping expectations low on that is wise, but it could be fun and light too.


The thing to remember she probably can't function well in a group conversation. So maybe be intentional about having one on ones with her in a quiet space if speaking, or maybe switching to writing if in a noisy place or group mingling context.

From my own experience I couldn’t tolerate my hearing aids at all. My ears constantly itched I ended up with infections and the world was so loud it was painful. The whole thing was exhausting and I was glad when my audiologist and ENT said they were doing more harm than good.

I was then given an BAHA to try and whilst I loved how it helped my hearing and ability to communicate with the world. I couldn’t tolerate the soft band or sound arc they put it on for the trial. It felt like my head was constantly being squeezed. It sucked because whilst everyone involved in my care saw how amazing it was for me, that meant I couldn’t wear it for the 8hours a day 6 days a week needed to be approved for the surgery to actually place it. 

Now I have to make do without. I use a mixture of speech to text phone apps, writing / texting, lip reading and occasionally sign. I definitely think my life would be easier with hearing aids and often get frustrated but it’s not impossible to do without. It just requires a bit of a patience on everyone’s part.

There could be many reasons why they’re struggling with hearing aids, the first call should be going back to an audiologist and seeing what they advise.

i'm also a hearing person and my brother has now a cochlear implant in one side, and also had 2 hearing aids for a bit. i will only say what my experience is as a hearing person sice i am on the same side as you.

1. it's a piece of technology, it needs to be adjusted and it's only to assist your hearing. it doesn't fix it. so anything that interferes with it, batteries, etc., it's not just a permanent fix to your hearing. i think realizing that has helped me empathize with the struggle of it. obviously some people make it seamless for hearing people, but some people don't for some of the reasons you say.

2. it also depends on what type of hearing loss. some people i think may have been in war and had hearing loss, some people might have had some type of nerve damage, or neurological reason. so you don't know what the ""fix is"" or how they work. my brother's had to connect to to the nerve on the other side of his brain (i believe), to translate info to the other side of his head.. i think. basically, it's technology and you don't know how it works and it may not be perfect. 

i think that's generally how i view it. it's a tool, it's not perfect and it needs to be adjusted. so depending on the wherewithal of the person, they may use it differently and understand it differently.

i'm sure a young person who is born with some loss maybe be more in tune (pardon the pun) with it, versus someone who isn't. bassically, depending on the person, it may not be a cure-all. and they may be hiding that from you or not wanting to explain it or just not always know how to be in sync with it, or just be tired of it or just have to accept that it's not perfect. 

i think one key ive seen is the hard of hearing person has to understand how to communicate their loss to other people. but that can be daunting and exhausting because how can you, especially if it's new, or changing or just a bad day. so i think hearing people should understand that it's not always perfect, and depending on the HOH person, you have to navigate it too. 

my brother has a lot of pride so i don't know when he's just ignoring me or not telling me something on purpose, but i am learning how to empathize purely because it makes everything easier. it's a combination.

For people like your girlfriend's aunt, hearing loss was gradual, like the proverbial frog in the boiling pot. Hearing aids don't fix your hearing loss, they just amplify a lot of sounds, so when you hear then again, they don't sound right - and it's a sudden onset when you turn your hearing aids on. 

Audiologists can be kind, but they can sometimes have the attitude that you just need to sucker punch your hearing loss with the new hearing aids and get used to them, and the adjustment process can take about 2 months - and that's after you get your hearing aids to the place you want them. 

But making the adjustments takes a lot of patience and office visits, because the real world sounds nothing like the office. You get your adjustments and find out that trucks are way too loud or paper sliding on paper is too scratchy. But even when you go in, you have to be prepared to give a solid description of your issues, and audiologists don't always talk people through the ways to describe sound (tinny, scratchy, pitchy, etc.) or how to dissect where the issue might be (environmental settings, specific speech sounds, male or female voices, etc.). 

There's also a huge over reliance on tech, in my opinion. The charged battery thing is a problem for me when I fall asleep without meaning to. Hearing aids are getting ""smarter"" where they make decisions for us about what they hear and I've personally found the tech to be incredibly ineffective, to the extent that I try to get some of it disabled when I get my new hearing aids (which audiologists and hearing aid companies don't always love, so it requires a lot of self-advocacy). 

And hearing aids all sound and feel different. I switched from Oticon to Phonak and it was a horrendous change - I love my Phonaks now, but like I said, lots of visits with lots of adjustments and lots of dissecting the issues I was having. And different hearing aids have different processors, which we can't always tell but our brains know something is off.

On top of that, they can be physically uncomfortable. Had to switch temporarily to a different kind of ear mold and my ears were hot and uncomfortable to the point that I was feeling like I was going to blister. My ears adjusted though, so it ended up being fine, but .. it gave me a new appreciation for why people might avoid them. 

So, patience is key. Ask her what she needs to feel more comfortable wearing them. Maybe she'd prefer to start out in smaller settings with fewer people in quiet rooms. Maybe she needs a mobile charger. Maybe she needs more support getting to the audiologist for adjustments. And if that's the case, make it more like a ""what do you say we make an appointment and do something nice before/after?"" So it's her decision, but she's not asking, and it can be a bonding activity. Maybe a couple of trusted close friends/family could offer to be with her while she uses them so they can help her identify things that don't sound right so she can take notes to the audiologist. I've literally used the notes app on my phone with exhaustive lists of things to fix. At one point, I got my audiologist's email address so I could send her the list in advance and we could make the most of my appointment time. 

This is a sweet question and I appreciate you asking. It sounds like she has a lot of people on her side. 😊

So kind of you to be concerned about your girlfriend's aunt, and to try to understand more about how she might be helped.

I haven't read every comment but there's a lot of great explanations here. Two things that I believe haven't been mentioned:

First, there is a difference between hearing and comprehending/processing/decoding.  They are connected but separate capacities. You can hear without understanding.  If you receive all the input but your brain can't make sense of it, or has to work really hard to make sense of it, it can be overwhelming and even painful.  It can just sound like a lot of noise. Processing/decoding can erode over time with hearing loss, which is one of the hypotheses about how/why it is linked to dementia.  

Second, you say she ""pretends"" she hears stuff, but it is quite likely that she is not pretending, she truly believes she has heard what was said correctly. She is just mistaken. The brain will ""fill in the gaps"" for you (for instance, with pattern recognition -- think about how many of our daily interactions are quite formulaic and how it would be fairly easy to ""guess"" what a next word was/was likely to be in most interactions) without you even being conscious of it (this is especially true with gradual hearing loss or loss in only certain registers), and it is very difficult to distinguish between what you actually ""heard"" and how your brain understood it.  This is just something to be aware of, as she is likely not even fully aware of the extent to which her brain is using other capabilities and NOT her hearing for communication comprehension.

One last thing, I think most people, even those who are HoH, don't fully understand/grasp all the nuances of this experience, as discussed here.  I wonder if it might be helpful to translate some of this for her and she could read about other peoples' experiences with being HoH? She might recognize some of her own experiences and be more open to exploring how to get support so she has a better quality of life, that bettering her hearing is possible.

Oh man I'm early 40s and when I got my hearing aids I had to regularly leave rooms because cups were set down on the counter too loud, etc. Once my brain adjusted, it became annoying to wear glasses and hearing aids because then the outside of my ears would hurt. My long hair rubs against the microphones which is LOUD so I have to wear my hair up. If I want to lean against the couch or lie down, they pinch my ears and I have to take them out. At the end of the work day my ears are aching from them so I rarely wear them at home. It drives my husband crazy. They are a godsend for hearing but a constant physical annoyance.

Outstanding that you are trying to understand what/how hearing aids affects hoh. I started losing my hearing only 10 years ago, 5 years ago, my left ear was profoundly deaf and the right moderately deaf. I started using hearing aids about a year earlier. In 2020, I went with a cros and that help…but started really understanding that hearing aids lack so much. Everything was amplified, ok I could turn things down. Oh now I can’t hear certain sounds..look up the speech banana. My hearing lost certain range so I could hear partial words…certain sounds had been lost to me. So, hearing aids cannot replace certain sounds and things become gibberish.

I headed to lip reading, better hearing aids and finally a cochlear implant. Lip reading helps a lot, but you have to realize, you then can hear what you can see..hmm another issue to overcome.

Restaurants and groups are difficult because everything is amplified and depending on the type of hearing loss, the gibberish is multiplied. Even more frustrated.

Hearing then becomes work, work leads to fatigue. Add in the frustration…it’s incredibly challenging!

Bless you for working with her to help. You are amazing to do so. Many just walk away…

Maybe it’s the wrong hearing aids? I’ve had….hmmm maybe 4 or 5 pairs in 15 years. The first pair I still struggled to hear. It was like I was in a barrel. The sound wasn’t very good. The next pair were amplifiers. They made sounds sound unnatural. My voice echoy and loud. Claps, doors closing, all that was loud and unnatural. (I woke up deaf so I know how things should hear). I went to oticon opn next and they were my faves. But then the one died and they refused to fix them because they knew they’d get more money selling me other ones. I tried 8 different kinds of phonak because that’s the ones the lady I was seeing liked. She refused to let me try oticon until I had tried all the phonak ones and they didn’t work at all for me. Like, I couldn’t hear anything out of them. So, finally, I picked a new oticon pair. They immediately worked. They are the most natural sounding hearing aids (I mean the entire brand, oticon) that I’ve ever tried and they are my favourite kind. However, I’d still prefer the discontinued one. 

Sorry for the long story, but maybe she has the wrong type and she doesn’t like them? Maybe she wants something louder? Maybe she wants something more natural hearing? 

Also hearing loss, for extended periods of time, changes your brain. I stumble on words when I read out loud now. I have trouble telling the difference between similar sounding words. (You say why do you care and I can hear why do you bear, as an example). And you learn how to tune things out. You learn how to not listen because you’re used to listening for specific things. And it’s exhausting. In crowds, groups, noisy situations. Trying to focus on people speaking instead of all the noise. It’s a lot. Mentally and physically draining. I’m 40 I needed hearing aids around 26 years old. I have become so isolated and sad. It’s a tough life. 

Maybe ask her 

Do you want more natural sounding hearing aids 

Is there an echo

Do they hurt your ears 

Can you hear ok when you use them or are they too loud 

Have her set an alarm for the same time every day to remind her to use them. If she uses a cell phone often, set it there. Or have her write it down somewhere she can see it and set an alarm for when to take them out and charge them. Ask her if she wants to go back to the specialist and have moulds made (if she’s using the domes) because they can be more comfortable and have more hearing capabilities. Ask if they hurt her ears. Make her ears itchy. There’s always a solution, you just need to find the actual problem.

Along with what everyone else has mentioned here, your girlfriend's aunt might also be struggling with the way hearing aids distort the sound of her own voice. When I'm wearing my aids, my voice sounds very muffled and I'm unaware of my volume. People will point out that I was too loud in an otherwise quiet situation or too soft for them to hear me. I've become much more self-conscious about speaking, which can make me feel isolated even when surrounded by people.

As someone with ADHD and autism, wearing my hearing aids can also be very overstimulating. The sound of the air conditioner never bothered me before, but now it's SO loud. When listening to music, certain instruments and pitches make my hearing aids go wild with extra noise, which ruins the experience. A full day of trying to discern human speech amongst all that other unwanted input is exhausting.

As far as alternatives if she won't wear her hearing aids, you might want to see if turning on Live Captions or other speech-to-text features on her phone might help. Or even a small notebook and pencil so people can write things down for her. Learning sign language is great, but it takes time to become conversational, and it would require enough people in the family to dedicate themselves to it--including herself--for it to be truly helpful.

I wear hearing aids and I'm autistic and ADHD. If I'm just at home, I won't wear them. Taking off my hearing aids at the end of the day is as good as taking off my bra or high heels.

Can vary person to person and depend on a couple factors. For example someone who has milder loss that went undiagnosed for most their life may find it easier to go without hearing aids because it’s what they’re use to. Sensory issues and technical problems also play a part. Overall it would be better to ask the family specifically than strangers online.

You might consider Cued Speech.  Here is what Google Ai has to say about it: 

In Brazil, Cued Speech is known as Português Falado Complementado (PFC), or Portuguese Spoken Completed. This visual system uses handshapes and hand positions near the face to provide visual cues that distinguish consonants and vowels, making spoken Portuguese fully visible for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Adaptations of Cued Speech exist for the Brazilian dialect, aiming to improve language acquisition and literacy for deaf children by providing a clear visual representation of spoken sounds that might otherwise be indistinguishable on the lips.  

The good news is that your girlfriends aunt wouldn't need to learn how to produce the hand motions, just interpret them.  If you want her to understand you this is your best option.

Understanding that they aren’t going to fix your hearing is step one. Step two is wearing them as much as possible, you have to train your auditory nerve to adjust, and it will. But give it time. It’s been used to a certain level of input so it can be really overwhelming at first. Loud environments are still difficult for me and I’ve been wearing them 35 years.
Also, some deafness with age is probs related more to a slowing down of auditory processing, and could also make adjusting to hearing aids a bit more difficult, and also make sounds overwhelming. Patience is key, she should take breaks but try to wear them as much as possible.

Try Live Transcribe on Android phone or whatever the apple/ios version is.

I can't really hear anything in a crowded room like a restaurant or anything with background noise with hearing aids. Or in a classroom or something (I used to teach). 

So I don't see much point. I put the closed captions on the tv. And I took up speechreading so one-on-one conversation isn't a problem.

They're not very comfortable either. Some people get headaches from them.

I’m 75 and have been wearing hearing aids for 25 years. Hearing was still hard for me at times and I started using a transcribing ap, Live Transcribe. It’s been great when I want to have a conversation without asking someone to keep repeating themselves. If I’m on call, I use CaptionCall. This is very helpful because it automatically saves every conversation. If I do forget some details of a call, I just go back to the ap and read it again. I recently bought new hearing aids and I seriously wanted to take them back! But I remembered back to how hard it was to embrace hearing aids. So I stuck with it and after 3 or 4 weeks I got used to them. It takes time and effort to embrace hearing aids.

If you're someone who wears glasses in daily life, the feeling you get from a new prescription is similar to hearing aids. If not it's dull, achey, your eyes feel stained, you have a headache etc. And criminy, everything is so loud. The sound of people's feet on the floor at yoga made me want to scream.  

I had this problem for a week when i first started then 2-3 days after the adjusted my prescription.  Eventually my brain got used to what it was processing. 

So if she's not wearing them consistently she's going to feel like poo when she does.

Note that hearing loss has an impact on dementia. 

Beginning dementia might make it harder for her to manage the hearing aids.

There are divided opinions on rechargeable hearing aids. I have a friend fiercely claiming that rechargeable hearing aids ”ruined her life”. She can’t keep up with charging them, since they don’t last a whole day as she uses them a lot. Myself, I definitely have and want to have batteries.

I find that aids leave me exhausted. They amplify all the wrong things. The sound of aircon, the neighbours running upstairs, dogs barking. I end up having to work really hard to filter the sounds out. When I lived alone, I used to think “why bother?”

As a HoH person who's been wearing hearing aids since 3 years old, I'm used to not being able to hear as a person with no hearing issues would. I'm also still a bit insecure &amp; very aware when it comes to people look at you differently when you wear hearing aids. In my experience, a lot of people like to test if you really can't hear by speaking under their breath, saying things they know you can't hear, playing little mind games, etc. It can make you feel isolated &amp; targeted. The first time I received loaner hearing aids, I never knew how loud the world really was. I had a migraine for a week and only wore the loaner for 1 day because I couldn't handle it. 

A ""new"" HoH person now has to think about the constant need to charge them, can't get them wet, the price, the type to get, the maintenence, remembering to even put them on, the discomfort with having something in your ear all day, the possible periodic hearing tests, losing them, needing them to be adjusted, etc. That's a whole challenge to deal with. Now add being neurodivergent on top of that. It's a real struggle. Even as someone who's been wearing them all my life I still forget to do things and during emergencies I'm left with the decision to either grab my hearing aids first or deal with the emergency first and struggle to hear. 

Learning sign language could be a great idea, but remember the majority of society don't rely on it so they don't really know it or care to know it. That, too, can make one feel isolated. Plus, unless it's simple signs, I believe it's harder to learn as you get older.

Has anyone has success with Tinnitus maskers in their hearing aids?

Based on all the comments, you can tell there are a number of people for which all-day hearing aids are too much of a burden.  For these type of patients, i recommend the ClearCast PAL - a wearable hearing device that goes around the neck like reading glasses, and is there when needed, and easy to take off without getting lost.",2025-09-17 13:02:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njcjzi/hearing_person_here_what_might_make_hoh_people/
1njcbf9,hardofhearing,Moderate to mod severe loss experiences,"Hello! My 6 month old was born with mod - mod severe, relatively flat SN hearing loss (initial ABR showed 55-60 db loss, two follow ups showed 45-50db). He just got his hearing aids and is doing great with them, and we are learning ASL as a family, but I was wondering if there was anyone in this group who has a similar loss (or has kids with a similar loss) who could give some insight on what he is likely hearing without his aids (I’m thinking of bath time, bedtime, early morning and nights). Our audiologist played a simulation for us which was helpful but just trying to further understand what his every day is like. Thank you!

Try to remember that even with his hearing aids in, he may need a lot of visual or physical cues that you’re interacting with him. I love that everyone is learning ASL! It’s going to be tough at times, but keep that part up! 

I don’t know for sure from his tiny perspective, but I would imagine hearing aids will feel overstimulating sometimes when there is a lot of noise happening. I felt that way as a kiddo a lot, but hearing aids have changed so much. You’re doing great!

I was born with and have more hearing loss than that, but some things that hearing people have been surprised I can't hear and I've been surprised exist at all:

- short intake of breath indicating someone is about to speak (I talk over people all the time accidentally bc of this)

- hearing through walls (seems like magic to me, once the door's shut or wall's there all noise is done with)

- secondary information; i can't hear if people are saying stuff next to me but not directly to me, which can cause some confusion bc they think I should have been close enough to hear it 

- I remember as a kid I just thought the world was just really quiet. Didn't understand people could hear more than I could for a while (I wasn't diagnosed till I was 6) 

(Might add more points later if I think of anything) 

Doing ASL is definitely very good!! He'll have way more opportunities if he knows ASL than not.

You can google a picture of the hearing loss/speech banana chart which will showcase different sound points.

Following because I have a one year old with the same loss🤍

I was born with moderate loss in one ear and severe, bordering profound in the other. My parents went the 'hearing aids and speech therapy, put her in traditional school route' so I didn't learn sign until my half brother was born (he has profound loss in both ears). You're doing good by him to learn and teach sign! 

Your son will still be able to hear things up close without hearing aids, it'll just sound kind of quieter and muffled a little. Hearing aids this young will be a great benefit to him and he'll develop speech at the normal pace. I didn't get hearing aids until I was 3 and was so far behind. It would be good to have some form of speech therapy/pathology appointments eventually to evaluate if he would have any trouble in school. For a long while I wore a device where the teacher would wear a mic and it would play directly into my ears.

I use a bed vibrating alarm clock now but when I was a kid I was able to get away with a really loud alarm clock at the loudest volume. I always put my hearing aids on as soon as I get up and they're the last thing I take off before I climb into bed. I don't ever take my hearing aids into the bathroom when I'm planning a bath/shower because I don't want to take any risks they would get submerged in water. I did ""lose"" hearing aids when I was a kid (just playing and them falling out never to be found) so definitely invest in insurance for them as he's growing up.

Kids can be mean so definitely keep an eye out for any potential signs of bullying. I dealt with that a lot and was kind of shy and withdrawn because I didn't want to stand out. 

Loud places will always be a struggle. Think restaurants, big crowds. Hearing aids are such a help but they're not perfect in noisy environments. He might get overwhelmed in crowds or noisy places. Bonus is you can take the hearing aids out and suddenly the world is a little quieter (my boyfriend constantly says he's envious of this lol). 

As he gets older and learns to read, captions on the TV are a must. Despite TV watching being in generally quiet environments I still struggle with understanding unless the volume is up higher than others find comfortable. 

You're asking the right questions and you've already done well by your son. He'll have a rich full life. Good luck!!

Edited to add:

Make sure his ears are *completely* dry before hearing aids go back in after a bath or else you'll be dealing with ear infections.",2025-09-17 12:52:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1njcbf9/moderate_to_mod_severe_loss_experiences/
1nitlmt,hardofhearing,I regret not wearing ear protection at work,"I never protected my hearing from noise at work because why? It's so uncomfortable. Yeaa and now fuck me.

Half a year ago (im March, to be exact), after a sudden, violent high pitched sound at work my right ear suddenly became ""clogged"". That's how I thought it was. I could hear less and tinnitus appeared. I went to the laryngologist I was wrongly diagnosed but my ears were clean. I only got some B12 vitamin and steroids. Didn't help much.  
I didn't really feel like I could hear less but I had tinnitus which was annoying. The worst part of it is that this ear suddenly became super sensitive to all the sounds, it was unbereable. Listening to music in the car became a nightmare as even at low volume, all the high frequency sounds were like 3x louder painful.  
Also all the sounds become distorted when they're too loud, especially in a closed room with bad accoustic (family dinner during Easter). I'm having trouble understading what is being said because all of the sounds just mix together.

I was an emotional wreck because I did this to myself, I could've easily avoided it by wearing fucking ear plugs or whatever. I went to hospital after almost 2 months after the accident, they told I could've come earlier so I could receive medical treatment and steroids right into the ear. Maybe I could stand the chance to maybe improve my situation, but it was too late and not much could be done.

I regret so much not going to the hospital in the first place and waiting for so much time for nothing. I went through hyperbaric chamber therapy which helped a bit but it was already 2 months late.

Now, the situation is a bit better, tinnitus is kinda bereable, it's not too harsh and it quietens down when I rest, worsens if my hearing is overstimulated. Over sensitivity is also a bit better.

My audiologist told me that both tinnitus and sensitivity would go away on their own (up to one year) but I'm not entirely sure. I'm looking to hear your story or point of view.

I'm here for industrial hearing loss. Don't use noise canceling, stick the no noise ear muffs on and normal ear buds under. 

Industrial noise is tough. Vanity is stupid shit on the floor.

Protect your hearing now and give it time just like they said. Make a note of any changes and go see your dr if there aren’t improvements.

I began working in a beverage manufacturing plant in 1981 in the USA. There were no “foam” earplugs available at the time. (I’m not even sure if they had been invented yet) We used cigarette butts as earplugs in the “filling room”. As the years passed, foam earplugs and mandatory hearing tests were available. I have severe hearing loss and tinnitus now, at 62 years of age. I’m retired… and have hearing aids. I’m on my third pair of hearing aids, and have been amazed at the technology. I had actually begun experiencing hearing loss during my preteen years due to a specific antibiotic that was used back then. That particular antibiotic has since been removed from use I think. I tend to self isolate a lot. I don’t like going out into public places. But the world as a whole has become much more accommodating to people who are HOH. Especially now that I’m older with gray hair.

I was on an aircraft carrier...in an office spaces directly below the flight deck and there was a catapult as well.  I was in that office for almost 2 years.  The only time it didnt require hearing protection was when we were in port or flight ops were suspended for a short period of time.  Someone had to answer a phone and that person was usually me.  I wore mickey mouse, but would slide the right side off to when I was on the phone.  I have severe right side loss and moderate left side loss.  I remember some nights my right ear aching so badly it brought me to tears.  That was about 30 years ago.  I wish things could/would of been different, but it is what it is.

Hearing loss is irreversable. Only tinnitus and over sensitivity may go away. It got better, though.   
In the beginning, it was 80 dB loss at 6-8khz, now it's at 60 dB.

I work in a wire harness factory, light manufacturing environment, not an excess of loud machinery, there is various shapes of fork truck and Taylor-Dunn vehicles though. There is a wire braiding machine occasionally that sounds like a WW1 machine gun, a few impact wrenches in the distance.  
When I feel like I'm losing focus on my task, I'm easily distracted by all the sounds, I wear basic hearing protection, foam earplugs. HR recently told me for safety, we're only allowed to wear in one ear =(",2025-09-16 20:58:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nitlmt/i_regret_not_wearing_ear_protection_at_work/

1ngvgwe,hardofhearing,Do you experience dizziness with loud sounds or musical beats (Tullio Phenomenon)?,"Curious: Does anyone else experience this? Apparently people with hearing loss and tinnitus (which I have) can develop this. I have been experiencing it with loud sounds and music for about 6 months now.

Online it is described as: 

“The Tullio phenomenon (TP) refers to sound-induced dizziness. TP is not a disorder or disease – it is a symptom of an underlying condition.

People with TP experience disequilibrium (unsteadiness), vertigo, nausea, and nystagmus (rapid involuntary eye movements). The symptoms are recurrent, brief and frequently triggered by certain types of noise or changes in middle ear pressure. Trigger sounds include loud sounds, high-pitched voices, and sustained musical notes.”

I get it from the sound of kids screeching while they're playing, or upset. The sound is so much louder than anything else. It makes me feel queasy if it's a short burst of sound, but longer exposure (more than a second, or two) makes me dizzy and very irritable. The symptoms calm down fast once the sound goes away, but I'm still tense and anxious for a bit.

My symptoms don’t seem as severe as what you’ve described, but very high pitched sounds at a very high volume do make me feel dizzy. Especially if they come from the side of my hearing ear.

Yes sometimes. Not really with music. Just some random loud sounds. Like screaming kids, or loud thuds or screeches. I work in a school so these sounds are common enough that I noticed. It can make me nauseous if it’s extended. 

Unfortunately, taking my hearing aids out doesn’t help since the sound waves themselves also trigger this. However turning them off and leaving them in can soften the effects. I also get tinnitus, and get dizzy easily if I turn my head too quickly or flip my hair from a waist bend when blowdrying my hair too so it’s not out of the ordinary :)",2025-09-14 16:18:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ngvgwe/do_you_experience_dizziness_with_loud_sounds_or/

This is my recent test. I was not tested with words just the beeps. So I’m not sure why that’s listed. Or how they could get results. 

Thanks

Moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears. For some reason they're showing word recognition scores of around 85% (meaning that you understand words with 85% accuracy when the volume is raised high enough that you can hear it), but to your point I have no idea how they could report that if they didn't actually test with words.

If it helps, an audiogram is basically showing how much sound has to be amplified before your hearing can detect it. What the beeps are is playing a tone at a certain frequency quietly to start, then they gradually increase the volume until you can hear it (press the button or raise your hand or whatever). They test at a range of frequencies (the horizontal axis) and mark how much louder they need to make it before you hear it (the vertical axis). The further down the graph a mark is, the worse your hearing is. Your marks are pretty far down the graph, so your hearing is pretty bad.

Hey OP, are you sure this is your most recent one? Date on it is from April.",2025-09-14 03:00:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ngg7tg/understanding_my_audiogram/
1nfm8wc,hardofhearing,Wanted to share a little win my mom had with hearing lately,"Just wanted to share a small win with you all. My mom has been through the ringer with hearing aids I mean expensive, uncomfortable one some that just sat in a drawer after a week. We all kind of lost hope that she'd ever find one she actually used.

But then, a few weeks back I was reading this blog on medium about hearing aids and it mentioned some of the newer, smaller styles that were supposed to be more comfortable. That got me curious because the prices were less that $100 so I did some digging and we decided to give one a try.

This time it's different. She's wearing everyday, joins in conversation without frustration, and even joked about finally being able to hear the gossip at family dinners again. It's such a relief see her smile instead of struggle. 
I know everyone's experience is different but I thought I'd put this out there in case someone else has been in the same boat. Sometimes the right fit does come along.

So glad you found a solution. 

My mom has worn hearing aids for over 5 years. Just last week she marveled that “these things help you hear, did you know that “

lol. 😉

How bad is your mom’s hearing loss? Mild, moderate, or profound? My mom has profound hearing loss and doesn’t wear the hearing aids she got four years ago because they hurt her ears. While I hate yelling at the top of my lungs, I understand. 

We both have very narrow ear canals, and that little hump on the outer ear where the hearing aids rest is really small, causing her ear canal to hurt and the aids to fall out. I get it because I can’t wear iPods (they fall off immediately) and, even with the smallest inner ear attachment, no matter what ear buds I’ve tried, my ears hurt like hell. I finally found the kind that wrap around the back of your neck, and the sound goes through the bone outside your ear. Perfect!

Mom has an appointment at the audiologist on Monday, so we’ll see what other options there are for her. I need to find her something that works because not hearing can cause depression and cognitive decline. I know she’s unhappy not being able to hear what’s going on around her, not to mention it causes a lot of confusion when she misses half of what we’re telling her. 

So happy for both of you that you found a pair that works! Hopefully, we’ll have good luck next week. 🤞

This is great. Glad it is working out. 

I am interested to see how this would work for me, and I have questions:

Are you in the USA?

What type of hearing aids did she choose (brand and model)

1nehgue,hardofhearing,Xrai ar2....early reviews?,"Considering getting these but wanted real world experience with the new release...only a couple of weeks in the market so any one using them and dealing with any issues? 

[댓글]
I had issues with their first iteration of Xrai, had to return them. No idea about ar2.

I am currently using Captify.

It's not perfect and not expecting perfection but super fascinating to use them and lots of updates coming up in the future for more QoL.

Currently using my phone and their transcription service daily (due to difficulties hearing different languages) and it is quite nice but pricey. For the XRAI AR2, I pre-ordered on 08/29, they were shipped from a CN (seems China does fab/manufacturing work for most of these high tech products) warehouse and their estimated delivery date is next week 09/21 in the USA west coast. It will probably be like the Even Realities G1 which people have reviewed but with slightly better battery life and brighter screen. But the biggest draw is the no more subscription required ""XRAI Premium Lifetime"" which comes with the classes. On their ""xrai dot com/pricing"" page that would be ""Unlimited normal transcription+ 600 pro minutes / month - for life?"".

  
So with this and physical glasses/battery/hardware seems that it'll be nice deal. Their page hasn't said anything about if it can also let you listen (apologies - audio for hearing capable users) like the Ray Ban Meta. Maybe they will have controls and shortcuts with a customizable app like the G1 glasses - but this is another uncertainty. You might also be locked into the XRAI ecosystem software - but the app, website and listening logs has been really good for me so far. One really clunky thing about the software for the glasses is the AI voice command ""Hey XRAI"" - it is very difficult to pronounce unlike ""Alexa, Siri or Google"". It will probably be a good product for deaf and hard of hearing users, I can confirm as a hearing user that the transcription is pretty accurate in multiple languages (it'll be the same on the glasses as it is on the phone).",2025-09-11 19:03:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nehgue/xrai_ar2early_reviews/

I'm in my 40's but never worked retail, hospitality, restaurants, etc. I have severe to profound hearing loss and never could imagine myself working in those environments. but my lack of customer experience seems to a blocker to breaking into IT. 

Which customer experience jobs have you had successfully despite having hearing loss?

[댓글]
I’ve worked for the Disneyland Hotel, as a cashier in a grocery store, and as a waitress. Being able to read lips got me through it but the job was obviously easier for coworkers without a hearing disability. I’d personally recommend hotels since it tends to be a quieter environment even when the hotel is insanely busy.

I try to stay away from customer service job.

I haven't worked IT in a long time since switching careers but I don't remember it required much customer service experience. Maybe things have changed since I've been out of the IT game but it was more important to have the right degree and credentials with work experience, and if you lacked work experience you'd need some kind of IT entry level job to start off.

Funnily enough, I started in IT through IT support dept. and that was in the 90s. I didn't have the tools and accessibility that I have right now back then. I think IT support is a solid entry if you'd like to gain some customer service experience as someone who is deaf/HoH. Just make sure you have all the tools you can use as HoH person plus find the right kind of company to allow you the accommodations as a HoH to do your job well.

Hope this helps.

Lots of customer support jobs in tech and probably other industries are email only. I think lots of companies manage all their support tickets through email, or phone support is reserved for a higher tier of service, and if you're new you wouldn't be handling those customers anyway.

If you want to break into tech having tech customer support experience is a good way. Also outbound sales might be another route, kinda spammy and low paying but would be a foot in the door.

I've done medical payment posting and 3rd party returns.  It's customer service from the standpoint of near entry level and interaction with customers/businesses through email but next to no phone calls or face to face customer interaction.",2025-09-11 16:41:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nedpb1/what_customer_service_oriented_jobs_did_you_do/
1ndp4su,hardofhearing,Sign language usage,"How often do you rely on sign language? My daughter has a moderate loss in both ears since birth and has had hearing aids all waking hours since 4 months old. We did baby sign, bought all of the books and took classes as a family. My daughter is now one and is signing much less and seems to prefer saying things like  “ball” instead of signing. She has been pointing and saying mama, up, etc. just wondering if I should continually pursue more advanced sign with her or keep the basics and follow her lead. 

[댓글]
Keep it up because when her hearing aids die,  or in very nosy areas it is a great back up language to know.

As a late deafened/hard of hearing adult, I rely on sign quite a bit. Mostly in mixed environments where I can’t hear what’s going on. I use interpreters at concerts, conventions, and other events. Daily errands, restaurants, and shopping, I rely on other technology (notes). 

I think one or two years is too young to give up on sign language. Your daughter is still absorbing languages and figuring out how they work. Does your family have a Deaf mentor as a language model? PODCs probably have more relevant experience. I’ve never met anyone who regretted learning sign, but I have met a few oral Deaf who wished they learned a lot sooner.

Never, I grew up orally and I don’t know sign language apart from a couple of signs.

Please keep using it. There could be a time when something happens (the hearing aids break or when shes tired of hearing and prefers to communicate by signing or even in worst case scenario when she’s in a situation where she can’t talk, like choking). I sometimes wish my family and I knew sign language. It could prevent a lot of frustration and confusion.

I’m late deafened in my teens. Profoundly Deaf. I sign daily in my home and communicate through interpreters for work meetings. I use a notes apps for errands.

I am part of an early intervention program in my state that offers free sign lessons to families with newly identified deaf/hh babies. In my teaching of sign, I encourage family’s to offer everything and let the child decide what they prefer. However, I also encourage to continue to keep sign as an option. Communication needs get more complex as children grow. It’s helpful to have other options already available if oral only isn’t working.

Keep doing it! When she is in school she can take ASL as her world language credit. She will have a back up of hearing aids are broken or off. She will be able to connect with others in her Deaf community. 

Startasl has asl1 for free online. Then you can buy the materials for 2 3 &amp; 4 to download. It's a great base to go from. There are probably groups in your community where you can go practice.

Your daughter prefers that, because you and other people around her prefer that.

In devastated you’re saying ”rely on”. Sign languages are just like any other language, and don’t hear people saying ”How much do you rely on English” (implied, that they would be terrified if the child would use it).

You really really really need to respect sign languages just like you respect any other language. Children want to use languages that are meaningful and relevant in their lives. They need role models. They need you to care for and love the language.

Many HoH ante forced to live in the hearing world, and only get to understand the importance of signing when things don’t go smoothly in school anymore. It’s not too uncommon to go to community college to learn the sign language before going to college, for example, where I live. The reason being that the young adults want to be able to use interpreters in college. 

Personally, I really value having sign language in my life. It’s a tool, just like any other tool, that makes communication easier and reduces fatigue. When I feel excluded in hearing social groups, I can go to a signing group and regain energy, that I need for the everyday life among the hearing.

I wish I and others around me knew more signing. What we know we use a fair bit at times, it's just easier on me.

Options are wonderful. Keep doing both and let her lead the way until she tells you her preference herself.

Most of my daily life doesn't not involve sign but I'm glad I know some.",2025-09-10 20:18:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ndp4su/sign_language_usage/

I think it's an easy fix but hard to diagnose without seeing it. Can you take it in to your audiologist?

Do you have a dryer box? Either an electronic one of a sealed box with a packet of desiccant in it? You could take the battery out and store it for 24 hours to see if that helps.

Also try a new packet of batteries, if it uses them. Maybe the pack you have has gone bad.

It’s there in my chart).

I’m trying to transfer my care to another doctor in the memory clinic in the medical system I belong to, but he has to approve it. He refuses!!! I’ve explained that I’m hard of hearing, I have a very difficult time understanding foreign accents, and this is an accessibility issue. I’ve escalated this to the clinic manager and managed care (Medicare Advantage, which is an HMO). I said if I can’t change doctors, I’ll have to terminate the assessment. I’m at a total loss.

When the nurse told me this, she asked if my kids could come to the appt and help me out. I said my son works nights at the warehouse, and he sleeps during the day. My daughter works full time. I asked if the nurse could be in the room and “translate” for me. She said she couldn’t do that.

Can anyone advise me?

Slap 'em with an ADA lawsuit. Being able to understand what is being said is a reasonable accomodation.

Get a lawyer.

You can’t understand him because of your deafness. Demand real time captions for your next appointment. Get an IP relay number to make calls.  Make them accommodate you. IMO, you should stop bringing his accent into this. Just say you need CART for every appointment. Let the CART stenographer handle his and every other doctor’s accent. 

Getting a lawyer to file a suit citing the ADA is much easier said than done. It’s one of those prices of internet advice that everyone says even though very few people have experience with it.

I asked a similar question in a deaf group several years ago, and jeez! The hate comments I got!! Equating not being able to understand foreign accents with racism, I guess. In a deaf group!!!!

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Getting a lawyer might be the best option to get this moving.

I have a disabled 38yo son (autism, ADHD, Tourette’s, bipolar), snd I have a BUNCH of serious medical issues myself, so I’m very good at rattling cages, but this one has me a bit flummoxed. Well, today I have to send a letter to work on another issue. Another doctor in the group who needs a good slapping.

Most of my doctors at this medical facility (a university medical school and a Level 1 trauma hospital) are good-to-outstanding, and there are a few I want to clone and make a medical practice out of. I just have 2 God-complex doctors I’m dealing with. Well, I’m loaded for bear and am not backing down.

I’ve exceeded my daily allowance of cliches. LOL

As a training SLP I have to let you know receptive language difficulties are very different from hearing difficulties. Receptive language means you're ability to understand words, not you're ability to hear them! Someone with receptive language difficulties will also have trouble understanding written words for example, it's an issue with the way language is processed in the brain. Being hard of hearing can, but doesn't necessarily, impact your ability to process language. This doctor sounds pretty rubbish... hope you can find a better one soon

Same thing. I don't get foreign accents, people with those weirdly huge mustaches that cover the lips, and children and some women with high pitched voices.

I soft sell the accent. People get touchy about it, presumably like this bozo.

I would threaten a lawyer first.  Maybe ask the clinic admin if they know a good ADA lawyer and if they have the number for the local medical licensing board.  If they ask you why, tell them you tried being nice and it's no longer that time.  Then, if nothing changes, do a consultation with a lawyer.  As always, be sure to document the when, who, and what of all conversations.   Also, emails are good.  You could also start recording the appointments.  It might make them uncomfortable enough to approve a change of Dr.  At least you will have evidence that you are simply trying to get care.

Is there a different company you can use in the area who can take over your care?

Tell the clinic manager *in writing*:

&gt;

If they refuse, go straight to your insurance’s **ADA coordinator** or file a complaint with **HHS OCR**.

Key: use the phrases **“ADA,” “reasonable accommodation,” and “effective communication.”** Those trigger legal obligations.

I’m not even deaf or hard of hearing, but trying to understand someone with an accent is brutal. My kids are hard of hearing and I always think of them when I have to talk to someone with thick accent. Makes me sad 😔

Contact the patient advocate, if there is one.

I'm going the same thing. My doctor doesn't speak clear English. I called and requested a doctor change. For someone that can speak clear English because I can't understand my current doctor. I struggle understanding her, she's Asian.  I've contacted and spoke to different people about getting a different doctor and I'm getting absolutely nowhere. According to them you only get to change doctor's twice. I only remember doing it once. It's now a company rule, it's just between the doctors. I told the head person that was the only person that could help me. I have nobody to go with me. My husband with his work hours can't go with me. I need to go but can't because they are no help to me at all. I haven't gone since March, and I just can't get my needs addressed. It's frustrating!

I also have a son with Down's Syndrome. He has hearing issues and speech issues. I have to be there for him but with my hearing loss, it's easier said than done.

What state are you in?

Does your state have a Disability Law Office? In my state they offer legal assistance at no cost. They can step in to mediate and advocate on your behalf. They are more likely to take your case if you are not seeking a law suit but simple assistance exercising your right to communication access.

Ask how are the deaf assessed for memory loss? Look up an answer on Google before an appointment so you if they are giving a line pf BS.",2025-09-10 09:27:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nd9i69/doctor_with_extremely_thick_accent/
1ncoq6e,hardofhearing,Gas cooking safety,"Hi there! 

Half deaf since birth, I'm 52 now and have ME.

the illness ace the deafness is making me much more likely to leave the gas cooker on. I can't hear it. 

I left the gas on all night recently, when it wasn't lit. The windows were open and I think they prevented the gas from building up but the smell was very strong and frightening. 

I also leave the hob on because I can't see it in the daylight and can't hear it. 

I've flooded downstairs twice but taught myself not to leave the tap running anymore. However with cooking, I seem to be forgetting to turn it off. 

Has anyone got any tips? If I set an alarm on my phone, I won't hear my phone unless I'm in the same room as it. I don't have WiFi so can't use Alexa for cooking timing. However I'm thinking what I should do is have an old fashioned egg timer and wear it round my neck. It's not very sexy but might have to do. 

But if anyone else has got ideas I would love to hear them. I live in a rented property so not sure what tools there are I can use. I've written to RNID to see if they can suggest anything. 

I try to always check the knobs after cooking and physically make sure each one of them is off. But whenever I do forget, I do seem to be leaving the hob on. :'-( 

I don't want my flatmates to get upset with me, it's natural for them to be concerned and I don't want to be a problem!

I have a light on my vent fan above the stove. I turn it on when cooking so I know when the light is on, either the stove or oven is also on and needs turned off. I havent left the stove on for an extended period of time but I have forgotten that I turned the oven on.

I use my Apple Watch timer for some things like this. For example, I’ll set a timer for the water to boil bc I won’t hear it and in the past I’ve boiled it down to nothing.

Oh my goodness, I've got a smart watch so I can do this! I have been forgetting to wear it so I'm going to try that thank you very much x",2025-09-09 17:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1ncoq6e/gas_cooking_safety/
1nc1pkc,hardofhearing,Experiences with TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR Glasses (or Other Options) for Real-Time Captions in Healthcare Settings?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a healthcare professional with severe hearing loss (HoH). I’m looking for a practical and reliable way to get real-time captions for conversations with patients, coworkers, and in professional meetings.
I’ve been researching:
* TranscribeGlass T1
* XRAI AR 

A few questions for those who’ve tried them (or similar setups):
1. How accurate and reliable are captions in real-life noisy environments (like a pharmacy, hospital, or clinic)?
2. Which setup is more practical for all-day professional use? (comfort, battery life, charging while in use, ease of setup)
3. Has anyone compared the captioning accuracy of TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR?
4. Any major downsides or frustrations I should know about before investing?
5. Are there other captioning glasses you’d recommend that are better suited for healthcare workers who need quick, accurate communication with patients?

I’d love to hear from anyone—especially healthcare workers—who uses these devices daily. Your real-world experiences will help me decide which setup to invest in.

Thanks in advance!

You can test out the captioning for the XRAI AR2 without the glasses by downloading the XRAI Glass app. XRAI supports lots of different AI providers including the cloud and on-device so it's much more versatile. It can also run in your hospital's own cloud, if available.",2025-09-08 22:19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nc1pkc/experiences_with_transcribeglass_vs_xrai_ar/
1nbvhba,hardofhearing,Should I Report being HoH to HR?,"Not sure if this belongs here or in another forum, but basically I am hard of hearing but without an official diagnosis. I was profoundly deaf as a small child due to illness. Around 5/6 I had ear tubes put in so I can hear again, with the caveat that very low or very high sounds I just can't hear. I went to an ENT a few years ago and was tested, but all they said was I am 'borderline'. 
This is affecting me in my job because we have a few people who talk really low but also really quietly. Not a week goes by that I'm not reminding them I can't hear them or asking them to repeat themselves. And I was late for a meeting because they changed the location 9 minutes before and I didn't hear the notification on my phone because I'm up and moving around. 
So my question is should I go to HR about this without an official diagnosis? I'm not even sure that they may do, just to cover myself from potential backlash. Thoughts? 

[댓글]
At this stage, see a doctor again explain the difficulty. Get a new hearing test. They'll provide you with documentation that your now diagnosed with hearing loss to provide to work. They may need to make reasonable accomodations for you.

I’d definitely recommend getting a hearing test (Costco does them for free, if that’s an option for you, and they won’t do the super annoying push for crazy expensive hearing aids that you’ll get elsewhere) and get a printout of your results, *then* go to HR. But don’t put it off.

My answer only applies if you are in the US and requesting reasonable accommodations under the ADA. I don't know how it works in other countries.

I just went through the process in the US. There is a form that your audiologist fills out that specifies how your abilities are impaired and what reasonable accommodations they think you should be offered.

Because of this, unless you have an audiologist willing to fill out the form, there's really no point in telling HR, they won't be able to do anything.

I recommend seeing an audiologist (not an ENT) to get a hearing test and then ask if they would be willing to fill out the ADA form for you. 

You also need to know what ""reasonable accommodations"" you are requesting. ""Cover yourself from backlash"" is not an accommodation. Being late for meetings is not an accommodation (although being late because the meeting location changed at the last minute is a problem that isn't disability specific.) Asking for information to be conveyed through text, asking for captions for video calls, those are reasonable accommodations. 

https://askjan.org/ has good information about what to ask for.

If you are in the US you would be protected and accommodated under the ADA but only if you self report to HR.

Additionally, if you are in the US you can get support from your state’s vocational rehab office. Every state has one but the name, funding, and services offered will vary. My state offers free college tuition, audiological exams, job training, job placement assistance, assistance in identifying accommodations, and sometimes they even pay for hearing aids. But you need to open a case and ask. These services are not advertised but are there for you.

No I would not disclose at this point. Try and find work arounds. One on my co-workers could not hear very well. She put a small mirror on her cubicle in front of her so she could see was behind her

[askjan.org](https://askjan.org)

I disclose my hearing loss but I don't leave it up to them to come up with solutions. I come with knowledge and resources. This shows I can manage hearing loss just fine. That said, I'm well educated at long last so I know my technology, what works and what doesn't. I can explain why hearing aids aren't called hearing miracles for a reason and why I need this, or that. Most of it is small accommodations. Between my hearing aids, lipreading strategies and introducing accommodations, I do fairly well. (Accommodations  usually help others too. Most people hide their hearing loss.)

It is hard to lead the way through. That's the difficult part. 

I'd also rather people know I can't hear rather than assume I'm stuck up or dense. 

If you don't have one already, get a smartwatch to help with help phone alerts...if you're talking about missing a text. That's helped me a lot.",2025-09-08 18:19:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nbvhba/should_i_report_being_hoh_to_hr/

1nb64oq,hardofhearing,HOH and pregnant,"Does anyone have any recommendations for when you're asleep with a baby? I'm panicking as I am due at the beginning of October with my first child, but I don't know what to do about when I'm asleep and baby starts crying. I wear hearing aids during the day and take them out at night, which means that I don't wake up to noises in the night. It puts a lot of pressure on my partner to wake up if baby is crying and I don't think it's fair that he will end up suffering from reduced/interrupted sleep in order to wake me up. I have a Samsung watch I use the vibration for wake up alarms in the morning. Is there something that can be paired with this?

[댓글]
My wife has no issue giving me the wake up slap letting me know it’s my turn to tend to baby in the middle of the night. 

We also have a leap frog baby camera which has a sound detection mode. In this mode, when it detects sound it will give a couple louder beeps.

Father to a one year old here. I got a bed shaker - there's a sensor under his crib that transmits to a little puck under my pillow that vibrates when he cries. Works great. Let me know if you're interested and I can dig up the make and model (wasn't cheap, I think like $150 for the full setup). I tried a smart watch but the vibration wasn't powerful enough to wake me up reliably.

Honestly.. just let your partner wake you up. I'm sure they would be getting woken up by the baby crying anyway. 

One thing I would suggest is set alarms for every 2-4 hrs at night to feed.. but some babies dont wake up as often to feed so you might just be waking for no reason.

I’m gonna get down voted and I don’t care. Take your hearing aides out and rest. Your partner will be okay they didn’t just grow a baby inside of them for 9 months and then give birth. My husband did all the night feedings after I broke down from the post partum depression that onset after my son was born. It was rough. Instead of trying to do it all because your sense of fair is off, take the rest guilt free.

Bed Shaker:

Hard of hearing here - I slept with my baby in her room. Never an issue. They do have vibration devices that will wake you up, so look into those.

All my kids have slept in my room (if not in my bed) so it’s never been an issue. But our baby monitor also has a vibration function. It’s an undvika from IKEA and was unfortunately recently discontinued but is still available in some stores and with some online orders. 

If baby wakes up it’s likely going to wake up both of y’all anyway unless you sleep in different rooms, your partner can also easily wake you up then go back to bed, but I would highly recommend sharing duties.

Set your alarm regardless of whether your partner gets up with you. I had to feed both my babies every 2 hours at first due to weight issues. They often were not crying at the two hour mark and I woke them to feed so I set an alarm all night long. 

But I also agree with the comments that support your partner waking you. It’s hard to know how things will go once the baby is here and you may need your partner awake with you anyway. I did not want to, but ended up needing to exclusively pump with both babies so my husband gets up with me every time and he changes and feeds the baby while I pump. It has bonded us all even more so as a family. Everyone’s sleep is going to suffer whether you like it or not and the baby is just as much your partners responsibility as yours.

I feel like this brings up the more general issue of how significant others play different role for a partner that is HOH or deaf, than they would otherwise. 

  
My best friend is a bit of a diva and tells her husband, ""You knew I would cost you money when you married me!"" While this is in jest, of course, there is some truth to knowing you will play a role in your spouse's/chidrens' lives that might look a little different. One that you signed up for. 

  
I have a husband and 2 kids that are hard of hearing. All live in my house right now and indeed, I am called on to do things for them that isn't maybe the norm. Do I need to wake up my 20-something kids to make sure they wake up in time for work/class? Yes, sometimes it's helpful/necessary. Do I make phone calls for them, schedule appointments, relay what was missed? Absolutely. Because I love them.

There are ways to cosleep safely. And if you cosleep your baby is so close to you that when they start stirring you notice it before they start crying. Their movements wake you up. Then if you can, you can just breastfeed in bed without getting up. For us, everybody got more sleep that way.

I’d recommend checking out [this monitor](https://www.hellobaby-monitor.com/products/hellobaby-video-monitor-with-5display-pan-tilt-zoom-video-baby-camera-no-wifi-night-vision-temperature-lullabies?variant=46443335188647&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22058489442&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAomAnzKbAL7MbXlqmALTETjmQ63lC&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_fnFBhB0EiwAH_MfZhqKk4g8z8qBuAGJ0vtzgCjGc6AUq3wdPbisSa597nBXt_CQJKbqmhoCFlkQAvD_BwE)

This monitor has an Eco-Mode setting so it dims the screen when it’s quiet but then the camera turns on when it picks up sound. This could be a great idea to have and when the camera turns on you know it’s picking up on your baby crying!

7 weeks postpartum and HOH. Honestly I’ve happily surprised myself that I do wake up when my baby starts to stir/cry at night. I was also nervous about this as I tend to also be a deep sleeper, but I guess mom instincts have kicked in. The first few days I think my husband had to shake me awake a few times to tend to baby but now I think my sleep patterns have adjusted.

1nafgy4,hardofhearing,requesting interpreter/disability accommodations at a theater,"i found out i was HoH last november and since about january, have been using hearing aids. i currently use jabra power BTEs and have been learning ASL for a year now. even though i am in the mild-moderately severe loss range (cookie bite shape), i really have been struggling hard with hearing people with and without my aids, of course its better with though. i have found regardless that i prefer to use asl and my bf is learning now as well. i’m not fully fluent yet in ASL but i’ve been learning at my college and frequently use it with my partner day to day (mostly bc i prefer using it over speaking and hearing but also bc we’re both learning so good practice!) as well as attend Deaf community and ASL club events frequently!

i have been looking into tickets for twilight in concert to go to with my bf. CONTEXT: this is where u go to a concert hall, theater (not movie theater) and they play the movie while having an orchestra to do all the music live. we're both musicians and twilight is one of my favorite movie series so its a win-win! 

there are not a lot of tickets left in the theater near us but the only seats left are in the very back rows of the upper balcony. there are still some accommodation seats (not just ones for ppl w mobility issues) left though. i have been considering calling the theater to maybe request an interpreter. while i *can* hear with my hearing aids, it isn't the best even still and i will not be able to hear the movie/music from the very back without any captioning or interpreter. i will still be able to enjoy the music by watching and listening but the speaking portions i will struggle with. i don't want to take any seats away from disabled people who NEED NEED these spots but i am wondering if this could be a good option. i am in asl 3, can hold conversations and am very good at picking up signs i don't yet know with context so it's not like this would go completely unused. i know the twilight script like the back of my hand but if there are things i miss, it'd be nice to have something in front of me. i always use captioning devices at the movies as well. 

would it be wrong for me to call for the accommodations and seats? would i be taking this away from someone else?

Never be afraid to ask for what you need. The worst that can happen is they will say no.

In my experience, movie theaters all have closed caption devices available. They don't always work, but they are available.

OP, you are deaf/hard of hearing. You know ASL. You have the right to an interpreter. You’ve already emailed. You should call the theater box office on Monday (IME, they are well versed with relay calls). Ask what your options are. They will be required to caption the movie or provide interpreters. If the movie is already open captioned, great! If not, they will provide interpreters. When it’s time to buy the tickets, they should cost balcony prices, but you will probably be moved to orchestra left or right. 

Let the theater, event manager, and interpreters work out all those details. You just need to enjoy the show.

Those seats are designed for physical accessibility for those with service dogs and/or mobility aids. 

They may already have an ASL translator set up for the event and a way for you to see them from any seat. 

Actual theaters meant for stage plays or musical events tend to have excellent acoustics and sound systems to make it easier to hear performers.

I am confused, what do you mean by NEED NEED? I also have a cookie bite hearing loss, but mine is solidly moderate and I actually can't wear my HA to movies/concerts because they intentionally make it loud to the point of being loud enough to damage hearing. Are you saying you don't need accommodation really, but it would be convenient if it meant better seats?

Those seats are typically physical/mobility for people with mobility aids or the seeing eye dogs so they can get up.

If it's opera they usually have subtitles at most modern performances. They may have some caption device available or can use your phone.

edit: Wait it's twilight in concert? You'll be able to hear the orchestra regardless of where youre sitting. You may need earplugs honestly.

And provided the film's not edited, you can lit download the subtitles to twilight and sync it on your phone or something. It's a popular film.

Even if you “just have clogged ears” a professional can clean them safely improving the quality of hearings. Make sure you’re being careful with your exposure to sound. You don’t want to damage your hearing.

It's definitely worth getting checked - basic hearing tests are non-invasive and easy, and they'll be able to tell you if you have earwax or a more long-term issue.

You don't say which country you're in but you spell British, so if you're in the UK then Boots and Specsavers do free quick hearing tests too - that was enough to tell me I needed a more serious investigation.

You could probably do a test online for free or find an app to do it

Ask a parent your your legal guardian to take you to an ENT. Get it checked out.

Don't play guitar with headphones its a recipe for disaster. Can you get a marshall microamp (the belt amp) or something? Maybe practice at school? A lot of musicians wear earplugs.

Of course you should get it checked out! If it’s ear vax, they’ll fix it in two minutes. If it’s other kind of heating loss, you’ll need to adapt to that.",2025-09-06 21:40:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1nabmpd/should_i_get_checked/

ALL THE TIME! Sorry was that too loud?! My aids broke at the end of July and I can't get in to get new ones until the end of September...

Why are we always accommodating hearing people? Shouldn't it be the other way around?

I traumatize them back. “Oh, am I speaking too loud? Sorry, it’s due to my LIFE LONG EXISTENCE AS A MEMBET OF THE DEAF COMMUNITY YOU FUCKING PINECONE” 

I get so heated about this, it is SO demeaning

I rarely get this because I hear myself so much through bone conduction and more or less lost my hearing AFTER I'd already learned how to speak and at what volume. I grew up with a step father who could hear a fart from china and learned early on to regulate my speech, walk gently if I didn't want to get caught late night snacking. Please don't read this as I had a bad stepfather, he was and still is a very good man. But in a strange way, I was trained without even knowing I had a hearing problem.

I’m hyper conscious of talking too loud so my husband always tells me to speak up. We can’t win.

I mean... I've been told I'm talking too loudly and I just... Talk less loud? Being hard of hearing doesn't mean you can't learn to adapt. It's not ""catering to hearing people,"" it's being a considerate human. Some people have sensory issues and loud voices in close proximity can be uncomfortable or even painful. Other people just don't want someone shouting in their ear- it hurts.

If they're not being an ass about it, there's no reason to take it personally when someone asks you to lower your voice when you're too loud.

Yup me too. I’m HoH, and I’m always told to lower my volume. And hearing people don’t want to repeat themselves if I didn’t hear them… love that!

I always get told I don't speak loud enough. because I can hear myself and I feel like hearing myself means I'm yelling. its just no winning so sometimes I don't talk and just use sign language.

I didn't realize how ableist this was until I met other people with hearing loss in college. My (hearing) mom would tell me this constantly growing up even when other people thought I wasn't being that loud. She basically used this as a way to shut me up whenever I got too excitable as a kid. 

I lost my hearing when I was two and I'm the only deaf person in my family. There isn't much of Deaf community where I live -- not even a school for the Deaf in my state. Then I went to Gallaudet and realized just how bad things were for me.

i’m excited to move into our new house just because i can yap as loud as i want without annoying neighbors

I’m sorry I can’t hear you with your hand over your mouth and my insurance doesn’t cover hearing aids. 🤷🏻

1n93k0y,hardofhearing,BAHA hearing aid,"Hi, I wondered if anyone could help or offer advice. My Nan has had the BAHA surgery and has the BAHA connect but when she wears it she gets really loud screeching feedback whenever she sits back on her chair and it touches the back of it and when she touches it so now she refuses to wear it. 
Seems such a shame that she’s been through the surgery for it to be so crap. 

Any advice would be really appreciated 

[댓글]
unfortunately feedback with the BAHA when something presses against it (chair, hats, touching it, etc) is going to happen. She just has to adapt and keep things from pressing against it. I wish there was something different she could do, but unfortunately that's just the price to pay to hear! hopefully, besides the feedback, she's receiving good benefits from her BAHA!

I experience the same thing with my Cochlear America Osia. To keep it from happening, I place a small pillow behind my head and off to one side away from the sound processor. This keeps the sound processor from touching the headrest on my chair. 

Hopefully, her chair will accommodate something like that.

Thanks for your reply. 
She sees no benefit to it than what her hearing aids give her so she won’t wear it now unfortunately because she can’t sit back and rest her head back on the sofa without it screeching. Seems like a bad design. Hopefully they fix it

The feedback is because the sound generated is being picked up by the microphone, I have the same issue if I lay in bed with mine on. I stream audio from my phone when laying down before bed. As I don’t need to hear I’ll just turn off the microphone and the feedback goes away. Other times say I wanna wear a winter hat feedback is an issue. I’ll turn off the aid microphone and use live listening on my phone the audio picked up on my phone will play in my “ears”. I actually have an accessory microphone that can clip to my shirt but I almost never have it when I need it. I always have my phone with live listen on my phone.

1n8r49m,hardofhearing,Accessibility tools for audio balance?,"Hi! For a long while now I've had worse hearing in my left ear than my right ear to the point where when I wear headphones the audio difference definitely is super noticable and bothers me. I wanted to know if anyone knew any accessibility tools that work on windows like the build in Android and iOS audio balancing between the left and right ear feature? I've looked for one for a while at this point but all I can ever find is programs that let you boost general audio levels or mute a ear entirely :(

A bit late here, but you can adjust that in the sound system settings, here's a link with a guide plus screenshots: [https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/163377-adjust-left-right-audio-balance-sound-devices-windows-10-a.html](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/163377-adjust-left-right-audio-balance-sound-devices-windows-10-a.html)

If the balance option is not showing up for your device (can happen with some bluetooth headsets) you can change a setting in the regedit to make it available, instructions here: [https://superuser.com/questions/1643029/unable-to-change-audio-balance-on-windows-10](https://superuser.com/questions/1643029/unable-to-change-audio-balance-on-windows-10)",2025-09-05 00:36:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n8r49m/accessibility_tools_for_audio_balance/

1n5jms6,hardofhearing,Do/did you feel like an imposter when being diagnosed?,"I've known I had an audio processing disorder since I was a little kid but I only recently learned that I was supposed to have hearing aids for it since I was a kid. I knew I lip-read a little but I always just thought that was normal or asking someone to repeat something multiple times constantly throughout the day.

I'm told I'm considered HOH because of it but I honestly feel like I'm an imposter because of it. I have other disabilities that I've just accepted but for some reason this, this feels like I'm lying, like I'm somehow ""taking someone else's spot"" or something. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has/is going through the same thing?

[댓글]
I was born hard of hearing. I was sick a *lot* when I was a kid, constant ear infections. I've never known anything else. And yet I *still* get people saying I'm faking it because sometimes I *do* hear things I normally wouldn't. Makes me feel terrible.

Hey there!!! I have APD and call myself HoH. 
I developed APD due to my CMT1E. 
I wasn't aware that hearing aid's help, thats cool and I will be bringing this up to my audiologist in November. 
You can call yourself whatever you wish. I believe we are HoH because since my brain cannot translate sounds into words sometimes, so I don't always recognize I'm being spoken to.
And in loud environments?  Forget about hearing correctly at all. Bar life is the worst for me. 🥲

I feel like a bit the same at the beginning... Which type of hearing aids do you have?

It's the same for me. I don't lip read, or need hearing aids, but have to ask people to repeat stuff a bunch and have to use subtitles and look up lyrics because I can't make them out. I haven't learned ASL or anything either. I also very much feel like an impostor, probably because I don't use hearing aids or lip read or use ASL and while I'm hard of hearing I'm not deaf and those terms are often linked in terms of implications; I can still hear the sounds, I just can't process them sometimes.

Not at all. You need to make people aware of it. I wear a big badge at work that says ""Hearing impaired, please speak slowly and clearly"" to try and encourage other people to make the accommodation for me (I'm a public librarian). 

The problem is that they rarely make that accommodation, even with me going out of my way to say that I'm HOH (I use hearing aids and rely on lip reading in noisy environments) . This goes both for my employer and the public, so lord knows what it would be like if I didn't try and make my requirements clear. 

So yes, make sure people know what your needs are, but don't expect them to behave any differently! Sorry!

Definitely see an audiologist when you can. Hearing aids have made a world of difference with my CAPD. I've had it for 19 years after a head injury and I also did not know that hearing aids were a thing for it until very recently.

I will say that I don't feel like an imposter because I got diagnosed at a children's hospital after intensive testing for weeks and I clearly struggle to understand others and communicate with them and anything other than the most ideal environment with me facing them. So I've never really had to deal with that specific part of the struggle.

I also call myself hard of hearing because there's no other way to really explain what's happening in public

1n3jh7e,hardofhearing,My mom is losing her hearing… and now she’s losing her life too,"I feel like I’m watching my mom fade away in real time. She’s losing her hearing, and it’s not just about sound it’s stealing everything from her.

She barely eats at all now because she feels uncomfortable sitting at the table and not being included in the conversation. She's no longer answering the phone because she can't keep up. She enjoyed music, TV, even church now it just makes her upset. It is as if the world is passing her by and getting on with it while she remains fixed in silence.

The part that terrifies me? She told me she doesn’t see the point of living like this. She actually said she’d rather be gone than live completely shut out. That crushed me.

We’ve tried doctors, hearing aids, support groups, even writing things down for her but nothing has truly helped. Every day she pulls away more, avoids people, eats less, and just… disappears a little.

I don't know what to do with her anymore. Has anybody else ever been through that with a parent? What actually worked before it was too late?

[댓글]
Why did hearing aids not work? 
Also consider the possibility that losing her hearing is just part of a bigger problem that comes with age (seeing friends pass, losing mobility and independence, facing mortality,  etc)

Not with a parent but I am going through this myself (30s). Yeah it's a struggle not to end it sometimes. 

Hearing aids don't work for me. Maybe they would for her, but they are a learning curve too and a constant reminder that you're disabled. Writing things down does help but she might be embarrassed you're going to the trouble. I guess just be aware that everything she used to love and do effortlessly is difficult and embarrassing now. It really is a difficult position and I love that you're making an effort.

As another commenter said little things can help. Try 1:1 conversations in quiet rooms with good lighting and caption software (most smartphones have this as a default utility now). Do things that rely on visuals over sound or just being together without sound. Don't let her feel like you're moving on without her.

Reminds me of a quote I’ve seen attributed to Hellen Keller: “Blindness cuts you off from things, deafness cuts you off from people”
And I can relate to this so much in my own life.

I have never tried them myself, and I would assume they work best with 1 on 1 conversations rather than a dinner table full, but maybe it wouldn't hurt to try hearview caption glasses.

Get her a tablet, and teach her how to use the live transcribe of people talking. Give her a pad and a white board and people can write on that with her as 1-2-1 chats. Or they can use the tablet and tasker l tablet pen. You can tell the tablet to stay on that screen so it's easier for her to use..
Show her that it's ok to raise her hand to speak or every one will go quite and be patient to hear what she has to say so that there's time and gaps for her to keep up.

This is exactly what happened to my granddad and why I created these: https://xrai.glass/ar2

The best lip reading aid that I know of is cued speech. There are some training videos on YouTube if you’re interested. The good news is that your mother only needs to learn how to read it and you only need to learn how to project it.

She needs professional support. The health care in my country has psychologists and counselors that support people with sudden or progressive deafness. Why haven’t you started learning sign language to include her at the dinner table? Be creative. You don’t have to do everything just using speech. Find more ways to communicate. Write, use microphones, transcription apps or order live captioning. But you really should learn to sign. Prioritize that, and stop making excuses. It’s possible. 

Get support from the health care system, and other groups for late deafened.

Being 73, I’m starting to experience what she has been going through for years. When your hearing starts to go , you misunderstand what people are saying and when you join in the conversation, it becomes apparent very quickly that you misheard what was said. It is such an embarrassing situation, that you eventually stop taking part in the conversations and then you stop going out in public at all. I tried the hearing aids advertised on TV, Miracle Ear, Beltone, etc., and they were no help. I finally went to an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor that specialized in hearing loss problems. I ended up with a Phonak in one ear and a Cochlear bone implant for the other. I now hear most of what I was missing. The doctor was able to determine that my hearing loss was a normal loss of high frequency sound in the right ear with a 60% loss of sound in the left ear coupled with a 100% loss of speech comprehension in the left ear. The bone implant hearing aid now sends all sound on my left side to both the left ear and the right ear, and I hear it in my right ear with 100% comprehension. 

If you haven’t taken her to an actual ENT doctor, that may be why nothing is working.",2025-08-29 21:15:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n3jh7e/my_mom_is_losing_her_hearing_and_now_shes_losing/
1n3dxdu,hardofhearing,How do you handle not being able to understand accents without offending people?,"Unless someone's English is really crisp and clear I struggle to understand them. Any accent adds a lot of difficulty for me. I'm trying as hard as I can but my brain is just getting gibberish from my ears. 

I feel like when I tell someone I can't understand them and they have an accent they often seem offended. Like I'm saying I don't understand because I don't want to because I'm prejudice against them for having an accent (which I'm sure happens). I try to explain I'm hard of hearing, but that doesn't seem to bring much more understanding.

I'm in the US, and when I went to the UK for university there, it took 2-3 weeks before something clicked and I could read lips again. I can now tell if someone has a UK/Irish/Australian accent when the TV is muted just by lip reading.

If you use lip reading, it may be part of why accents are challenging; the way people form their words helps generate their accent. And I feel like some accents/regions barely move their lips at all. If you work consistently with a population, consider watching some shows and focus on lip reading to possibly build more familiarity and make that mental connection. Otherwise, it's fine to explain that you have trouble hearing/understanding and ask them to slow down or enunciate more.

I have this same problem, so I am just honest and tell them I'm DHH and have difficulty hearing and we try again and again (or write it down, type it, etc)

I see that you said you already explain you are hard of hearing, but if I am ever in the situation with someone who has an accent and I’m asking them to repeat more than usual, I will say something along the lines of, “Hey, I am sorry I’ve asked you to repeat yourself so much. I have hearing loss. This makes me mishear things very easily, it’s not your fault, it’s mine. Please try and bear with me”  Because usually if someone is offended, they may be just self conscious of their English being well-understood. If you shift the blame more towards yourself (even though having hearing loss isn’t really your FAULT) it takes it off of them feeling upset/self conscious, and usually they will be more understanding. If they want to ask questions about it, I usually will let them and will answer their questions. 

If THEY bring up at some point something about their accent making it harder for me to hear/understand them, I still try and make them understand that it’s not really their accent/their English making the difference, it’s just because when I am listening to anyone talk, I fill in missed parts with what makes sense in context, and sometimes parts of their accents can sound like different things to me when I mishear. 

Basically, I try and assure them that themselves/their accent is not the problem, and that I just struggle with hearing/understanding people well and mishearing more than the average person. 

I am sorry that it seems that people are not understanding to you. It sucks when it feels like you can’t fully communicate your struggles, and sucks even more when it seems like OTHER people are upset by it! Like, I am the one living with this hearing loss, it frustrates me ALL THE TIME and EVERY DAY, why are you frustrated with me?! &gt;:( 

Hang in there. Here, we understand and feel you!! &lt;3

It depends on if it’s encounters that I have to be invested in or not, either for really getting meaning out of an interaction or if I’ll be working with someone over a long period of time.

I’ve had to invest time into some dedicated training on different accents that I encounter for work as things have come up. So when we were encountering more folks with Indian accents, I sought out good quality YouTube videos with someone lecturing with an Indian accents, when I started working with someone with a British accent I spent time watching the video version of the podcast she’s on or speeches she’s presented.

If it’s just a one off conversation I tend to be forthright about it my hearing loss and just say “hey, I’m deaf/hoh and struggle with accents sometimes”. Typically people are fine with that.

There isn’t really anything can be done when you can’t understand  someone (accent or not) than to ask them to speak clearly at a raised volume because you’re hoh

I go straight in with ""I'm sorry, I am a bit deaf, can you show me what you mean?"" or something along those lines that matches the situation. I'll also point to my hearing aids and smile. I say a bit deaf instead of hard of hearing because I feel like hard of hearing might be an English speaking phrase that doesn't translate well, but I could be wrong. I think it helps to phrase it as your own shortcoming rather than theirs, if that makes sense, because it places the emphasis on you not being able to hear and not on them not speaking clearly which is probably a more familiar situation to them when someone actually is being prejudiced. Basically I thought about what someone being prejudiced says and I do the opposite.

I have never related to anything more. 

Every job I have ever had, customers with accents? No bueno. I can never understand. I remember starting to cry when I worked for lowes because I got stuck on a call for the businesses to purchase something over the phone and a man was upset because I had him repeating his CC# like 10 times. The accent and the loud noises of Lowes was awful.

I love accents! But many do make it hard to understand. I usually ask people to repeat and explain that I’m hard of hearing. And by this point, I usually start signing naturally, which helps make my point. I don’t think I’ve ever offended anyone… 🫶🏻

Yes, I have the same issue. All you can do is explain I’m sorry I am hard of hearing. Can you repeat that? I have problems with accents from other regions of the country as well as accents from other countries. Enunciation is so important for those of us with hearing loss.

I don't I just look at them and say I'm going deaf please write it down

I just say I'm sorry I'm hard-of-hearing. Can you write it down or I just tell them accents. Are hard for me.

I explain that I’m hearing impaired

Don’t ask for repeats if you can’t hear them. Just something like ”I am a little bit deaf and I can’t hear what you’re saying. Would you mind writing name/adress/term down for me please?”

Focus on your hearing loss being the problem, not their accent.

I never mention someone’s accent. I just say very matter-of-factly “I’m HoH and am having difficulty understanding what you’re saying; could you please repeat yourself?” Or if they’re walking ahead of me and talking, or covering their mouth, I explain that I can’t hear them like that. By placing the “fault” with me, I’ve never had anyone take offense, and most people are happy to accommodate me. When I’m around kids who might cover their mouths or hide their faces when they talk, I try to explain that my ears don’t work very well and my eyes are my ears. I also will sometimes take my hearing aids out and tell them that that’s how I hear, but that they have to help me by speaking clearly and facing me. Most people will want to be helpful if you explain why you need help/support.

I always just say something along the line of, ""I'm sorry I'm hard of hearing and I'm having a little trouble understanding you, can you please speak slower? And my apologies if I have to ask you to repeat something a few times, it's not you it's me"", or something similar

Since I was diagnosed with cochlear hydrops, whenever I have a flare (which results in temporary low frequency hearing loss) I find it more difficult to understand people with Indian or African accents. 

I guess it makes sense.

This is my problem as well. I do read lips. I’m frustrated with Netflix as it takes me a while to find a movie and then it’s not in English. I wish they had an option to choose English only movies. As for people in life with an accent, I struggle so much. But I typically end up doing the same thing as I do with others. I just smile. If it wasn’t a question, most times people just move on. I can’t hear most people with any background noise, unless I look at them straight on and watch their lips. Oh, and I just dropped $6,000 on new Oticon hearing aids. Waste of money.

I get the same problem. It's tough because I have enough hearing that I haven't had to rely on lip-reading much, and therefore can't reliably use it to discern what someone is saying. In these situations I usually will ask the person in question to repeat themselves and clarify that I am hard-of-hearing. I also move my hair covering my ears to show them my devices so that they understand that I am being literal, not hyperbolic. Something that's also helped my understanding of different accents is listening to media with actors/creators/etc. who have accents that I typically struggle with. This helps me develop an understanding of the ways people with accents that I'm not used to form certain sounds, so I'm better able to discern what they're saying using context. It's still difficult, but not as much as it used to be. I'm not sure if this is helpful for you, as everyone's hearing loss is different, but I hope it is in some way. Best of luck!!",2025-08-29 17:37:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n3dxdu/how_do_you_handle_not_being_able_to_understand/
1n37z99,hardofhearing,Hiring for a very busy cafe,"Hello, 

I am a manager at a very busy cafe and have recently had an application come in for a front of house position from someone who is deaf and uses ASL/BSL/lip reading to communicate. I want to consider their application seriously and am very willing to organise accommodations but I wanted to ask this community for any thoughts, experience and advice. I am fully hearing. My dad has 5% hearing in one ear and 20% in another ear so I have some experience being around someone who communicates differently. I asked him and he said he'd hate doing front of house and thinks it would be too much, so I'm looking for other opinions! 

I'd love to hear from anyone who has worked in a busy coffee shop about their experience and how it worked, or if it didn't, why it didn't. Any and all advice is appreciated. 

Thanks!  

[댓글]
I'm 'only' hard of hearing, moderate to severe across both ears and wear hearing aids. I can tell you from experience in retail environments and having been in a busy coffee shop that it's hard to dial in on what I want/need to hear. 

For someone fully hearing impaired, you're kind of compelled to think both realistically and at the same time fairly. The only way to know if this person can handle the job is to let them try. Do you have other positions in mind if it doesn't work out? Perhaps parking them at the coffee machines fulfilling orders would be better suited, or kitchen if there's one available. Something with a chit system that they can read and fulfil?

I have severe-profound hearing loss in both ears (don't quite qualify for cochlear implants but am close; if you're looking at ""percent"" of hearing I'm at about 13% on one side and 20% on the other.) I am an oral communicator that relies heavily on lip-reading. I worked in a busy cafe in college a couple years ago. my favorite part was making drinks and meeting customers, but it was very challenging for me with how loud the cafe got from customers in addition to the kitchen appliances. if it got too loud for me, I'd work in the back doing dishes and such. I'd suggest asking the applicant their preference and what accommodations would help them be most successful in different settings. it might be having a notepad and pencil at the register so people can write down orders, or maybe they prefer to just make drinks and do dishes. doesn't hurt to ask, and I'm sure they would prefer you ask and welcome the opportunity to make their preferences known!

I have progressively lost my hearing over about 30 years and I now wear hearing aids. I'm a librarian, which is very people facing, and I do find it increasingly difficult to communicate with patrons. I don't lip read, which might make a difference, but then again one of my biggest frustrations is people who move their heads around and don't look at me when they speak, since it sends their voices in different directions. I imagine that would e very difficult with lip reading as well. 

I personally would not choose to work in a customer facing job at this point, but if the candidate believes they can handle it, I would certainly give them a chance (assuming they meet the job requirements, of course.)

Thanks for coming here to ask this btw…

I personally would find the background noise to be too much with hearing aids but… perhaps the person could communicate with live transcribe on their phone or tablet or laptop? I honestly don’t know if this would flow well at all. To me it would be the best shot at allowing me to do something front of the house. Depends on how busy the place is as well. Would the ai tech be picking up other conversations, I wonder? 

Perhaps job duties could be modified to less taking orders/register and more making drinks and handing to customers while letting hoh employee get some practice at register when less busy?

are you UK based? i saw the person has BSL.  if so they will be entitled to Access to Work and this will cover the staff members support costs in work-[Access to Work Info ](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work)

I’ve waited tables and it’ll be nearly impossible to reliably predict. Slow day? I’ll likely need nothing because the place is quiet. Busy day? I’m going to be exhausted because lip reading is how I’m understanding everybody. My employer would have no idea what the next day was going to be.

Moderate to severe, wear HA’s, lip read &amp; know some ASL. I would recommend you hiring this person. Disabled people often get passed over for employment, even if we’re capable. Though illegal, employment discrimination is common. If this person is upfront about his/her disability, your customers should be reasonable, expect a little more time needed to order. But if it becomes a “problem”, yet the person is otherwise dependable &amp; hardworking, then find another job he/she can perform better!

Fyi due to disability anti-discrimination laws in the US legally you can't disqualify them based on their disability. Just fyi

Also just because your dad wouldn't want that just doesn’t mean every hard-of-hearing person feels that way.

When everyone was still wearing masks,  a store in my mall accommodated their Deaf employee by putting a sign out that said something to the effect of ""I'm Deaf and use lip reading to communicate. Please take off your mask when speaking to me."" You could easily do something like that, instructing customers to look at the applicant while speaking. Something that could be discussed as a backup is you providing a small whiteboard for people to write their orders down if this applicant gets burnt out from trying to lip read in a noisy environment.

If that’s the job the person wants and feels they can handle it with reasonable accommodation then there’s no reason not to give it a try! 

Be willing to experiment to figure out what works. Maybe that’s printed menus that people can pick up and read over and then point to what they want. Maybe that’s a notepad or white board at the counter. Maybe it’s a “please be patient and face me when speaking” note at the register. Maybe it’s mounting a Roger pen/mini mic/similar device near where people order. If part of the job requires phone usage, there are captioned phones if they’re comfortable with that. 

There are deaf/hoh owned restaurants and cafes in existence where everyone on staff has some amount of hearing loss. 

Many times accessibility is just a matter of patience and creativity and not throwing in the towel as “just too much of an inconvenience”. I work in an industry that has almost no deaf/hoh representation but lucked out with a company and team that is willing to figure it out as we go and we are thriving. Give it a chance!

It takes quite a brave person to apply for this &amp; be willing to take on the challenge.

1n33zr0,hardofhearing,Looking for HoH pro/semi-pro live musicians using IEM,"Hello ! I'm 23, french, hard of hearing from birth and was impaired at 3/4 yo (""behind the ear"" type).

I've just joined an alternative rock band as a bassist, and our first rehearsal makes me face a tricky issue. We play with backing tracks and click, so all sounds go through **In-Ear Monitors**. 

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to adapt to this ecosystem in a way that comfortable and safe, and would love to find someone who's been there to chat with !

Few ideas below :

• My first thought was to just use regular IEM and crank up the volume to match my loss, but I was told by my audioprothesist that my hearing aids go through a custom compression the IEM don't have, and that loud volumes in the earbuds might be risky for the little hearing I have left.

• I thought of keeping my hearing aids and wearing isolating drummer headphones over them, but the comfort is 0% and they can't cover everything because of the impairment.

• The suggestion from my audioprothesist was to use a bluetooth TV Streamer that I have (ReSound Unite) to receive the sound straight into my hearing aids, which would be the most comfortable but might not be stable (maybe interferences with other HF comms), and I'm not sure the isolation would be enough. I have yet to test this at the next rehearsal, but I want to be extra cautious with the drums.

  
Thanks in advance for your time !

Hey there. I’m HoH and was the lead vocalist in a nine piece band for like five or six years. We used IEM, and my experience differs since I don’t wear aids. That being said, I will say your best bet is to talk to your band mates! You’d be surprised on the input they may have, and for me it was important to discuss what was going to be a challenge for me so we could all be on the same page regarding solutions.

I will say too, if you go for IEMs you’re going to want custom ear pieces. I’ve had around 15 surgeries on my ears, and I needed custom molded ear pieces due to all the scar tissue/damage that occurred externally.

Also, you will experience a strange “post gig ear fog” for lack of a better term. After playing a few hours with the IEMs in/walls of sound, you’re going to want some extra time to let your ears rest :)

Congrats on the gig, and thanks for representing us Deaf/HoH musicians!! WE EXIST!!",2025-08-29 10:42:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n33zr0/looking_for_hoh_prosemipro_live_musicians_using/
1n2ofxa,hardofhearing,44F BAHA demo for first time,"My audiologist has always tried to get me to go this route.  Today I tuned into a BAHA processor.  There is just NO way sound sounds this good!   I have conductive profound hearing loss since birth with my right ear slightly better than my left.  I’m greatly considering getting the surgery for the OSIA2 since my hearing loss is great.  I need power.   And even with the BAHA processor only the sound has greatly improved.  I’m impressed.  This is what deaf babies must feel when they get the cochlear implant turned on for the first time.

I can’t hear everything all the time, but they’re visibly aggressive as well. They do this while simultaneously accusing my hearing loss as being an “excuse”.

I can’t leave or escape my situation yet. I’m struggling to seperate their failing at being a respectful, adult human from my personal struggles and shame with my disabilities. Just looking for community, I feel so alone in this. Thank you for reading this 🫂

I'd simply start ignoring them ""sorry I didn't hear you"" until they get the idea and act like a decent human being. I always warn people if they don't communicate the way I need (facing me so I can lipread, stay by my hearing side etc) they just won't be heard. As for yelling, good luck to them maintaining that long term they'll just look like an idiot. Just reply back to them in a normal voice until they get the idea

Unfortunately I feel like some specifics would be more helpful in this scenario. Why do you have to put up with these people?

I hate to say this, but these are people you don't need to invest any of your time with. The problem is with them, not you. Just do what you do, the best you can. 

If this is a work scenario, involve HR like, right away.

I absolutely dig in during this interactions. I will be “more Deaf” than I ever have been. I can no longer read lips, or gestures, or hear ANYTHING. 

Treat me like an outsider, and I’ll shut you out entirely.

I weaponized mine. You’re muttering or whispering? I can wait silently until you speak in a normal voice. You want to yell like more volume will fix the issue? I can wait silently until you speak to me with a normal volume. Don’t want to do either? We’re not speaking until you do

Dear OP, I just wanted to let you know that I read your post and I sympathize and also empathize with you. I feel your frustration, and I’m glad others in this sub have shared a variety of coping mechanisms to help you get through this. I know that while you oftentimes (if ever) can’t change rude inconsiderate people, you can be conscious of your reaction to these people. I’m glad you are in this subreddit, and I just wanted to say that I have heard you and my heart goes out to you. I hope you are able to extricate yourself from these inconsiderate individuals soon. Please reach out whenever you feel frustrated or saddened… I’m right here with you.

I’m so sorry you find yourself in this situation. I’m glad people have offered advice to you and I hope you can find a way to get out of this situation at some point. In the meantime, I have found that if someone has ever treated me poorly in relation to my deafness, I have always calmly said “I’m deaf, not stupid” and walked away. If you are unable to do that, perhaps just walk away from any yelling situation until the person or people can speak to you in a more civilized manner. As other people have said, you can’t change people and their behavior at times, but you can change how you react back to them. I wish you all the very best

I’m so sorry. I know exactly how this feels. I wish I could help, but all I can say is that isn’t ok and you deserve so much better! 🫂

1n1d3ct,hardofhearing,TV sound through headphones  (No Bluetooth),"Hey! I’m really hoping someone can help me figure this out. 
So my dad is hard of hearing, he’s also elderly and does not understand new tech at all. I’ve tried to teach him but he’s easily frustrated and gives up.
 
He has had this device for a long time that he uses to listen to the TV. It looks like a mini remote and has different numbers on, it changes the volume he plugs headphones directly into it (3.5m jack)

He has now lost this device! Which is another concern because he doesn’t often leave the house, so no idea how he keeps losing things :(

I’m trying to find something to replace it but I don’t even know the brand name or what the device is called. It looked like old tech. 
I doubt his TV is Bluetooth compatible and I doubt he’d be able to use Bluetooth headphones anyway. 

I was hoping there’d be someone who might know what the device is called so I can try and get him a new one? Or something similar that he can just use without havjng to digitally connect anything?

see link for some examples. where are u based? 

TV Headphones for the Hard of Hearing - AmplifiedTelephones.co.uk https://www.amplifiedtelephones.co.uk/tv-headphones-for-the-hard-of-hearing.html

That sounds like a headphone amplifier maybe. Did it plug in to the tv too?

If he uses a hearing aid, a lot of the HA brands have dedicated devices for this purpose. They plug in to the tv and send audio wirelessly to the aids.

Roku?

Check the tv. Roku has a dongle. You can buy replacement remotes for $30.

If it isnt and he refuses to use bluetooth assuming your time has any value it'll be cheaper to buy him a roku tv that comes with a remote that's 3.5mm and  you or if you dont live nearby, paying the geek squad to hook it to his cable. Tv will be $150-200. Geek squad prob another $100 but check first.

My mother is in her 70s and has no problems using it.

Most ""conversations"" would last 10 minutes before I'd get frustrated and leave. Decades later, when in her 80s, my partner bought a small whiteboard. I could write down my comments and we started having wonderful two hour ""conversations."" She liked to hang out at a local senior center to read books in their little library. The whiteboard worked so well at home, I brought one into the center for the staff. The next time I was there, the staff was gushing about how brilliant it was and how much it helped with my mom AND other seniors with hearing loss.

Wow, this is so beautiful. You meeting your mum where she is at with her hearing loss instead of expecting her to meet you in the hearing world. 

This is going to stay with me as a HoH person, reminding me of how often I am hard on myself but this is only because of internalised audism.

Often people don’t want to try other communication than just speech, because it’s just weard and not normal communication. That’s just wrong. I wish more people would try to do things differently sometimes and notice that sometimes it actually opens up communication.

I use the translator app on my phone.  It was a lifesaver during covid hospitalization.   Always nice when someone thinks of something like this to improve a life.  Hopefully  you will have many more years to use this.

Awww I love this.
My friend's gran had a book that they would write in for her.

1n0le1i,hardofhearing,"20 years old with Auditory Processing Disorder, mild hearing loss &amp; auditory attention difficulties – looking for advice","Hello everyone,

I’m 20 years old and was born with Auditory Processing Disorder due to a genetic factor. Since childhood, it has affected my daily life. I can hear people’s voices, but often it feels like they are far away — even when they are close to me. Most of the time, I cannot understand what they say unless they repeat it once or twice. On top of that, I also have mild hearing loss and difficulty with auditory attention, which makes focusing on conversations even harder.

This makes conversations (especially in noisy places) really frustrating and sometimes isolating.

I’d like to ask:
– How do you cope with communication in daily life?
– Do hearing aids, apps, or strategies help in cases like mine?
– How do you deal with the social/emotional side of this condition?

Any advice, resources, or personal stories would mean a lot to me. Thanks so much! 🙏

Since your problem is with processing sound I would propose an experiment.  Do a search for Cued American English and you should find a few free training video series.  After you've gone through the training videos you will know if you can process English easier visually than verbally.  It won't solve your problem but knowledge is power.

I’m HOH, on the moderate/severe side. I’ve worn BTE hearing aids my entire life. I also have a Deaf family so ASL is also in my back pocket. 

As far as coping strategies, I tend to make self-deprecating jokes over my hearing loss. (Kind of like I take away people’s “power” if I beat them to it first.) 

Repetition: If it’s people I’ll never see again, I’ll bluff my way through the conversation and puzzle out the words I didn’t get later. If it’s the absolute pits, I’ll text it on my phone’s Notes app and they can answer that way if they prefer. 

It took me several VERY long years, but I finally found my tribe. My friends don’t care that I have to make them repeat themselves because they’ll rephrase what they said so I’ll get the missing part. They’ve done charades for me, which was hilarious, and they’re just very, very accepting of me as a whole. (Bonus: they now watch everything with captions! They were so excited to tell me that they “can hear the TV better”, LOL!)

I don’t use many apps so I can’t speak to that. I’m sure others here can help in that area. 

I hope this helps you a bit. It is/can be isolating, but keep putting yourself out there and you’ll eventually find your own tribe, too.",2025-08-26 13:08:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1n0le1i/20_years_old_with_auditory_processing_disorder/

I am having a lot of immediate memory problems and just a hard time following normal written and spoken communication.
Having difficulty following conversations like everything just gets dropped or not even held by my brain. Literally struggling to focus and remember on things said 10 -30 seconds ago. It’s like it’s not clicking in my brain.

Wondering how much of it might be related to hearing loss.

I already have had an MRI but the neurologist isn’t available until December.

Thanks.

I would recommend talking to your primary and requesting a full blood panel to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or hormone imbalances. Also, I would record yourself sleeping to see if you’re snoring. Are you at a higher risk for developing conditions related to cardiac function or other bodily functions? These things can all impact your overall function and should be checked.

When my mom, then in her 60s, experienced similar short term memory loss  she was alarmed and thought it might be Alzheimer's disease.

It was not.  
In her case, short term memory loss was a side effect of a blood pressure medication she was taking.  
She was able to remember facts and events again once she got a different medication.

I wish you well.

I also have the same issues. I went to the dr years ago. He told me it was a lack of focus. I was so frustrated I never went back. Fast forward, I got a bad concussion from a car accident and had to work through a couple of years of therapy. At least now o have something to blame it on.

I’ve experienced a similar thing. Had significant hearing loss in last 2 years and find I can’t recall information or remember people’s names like I did. Think it’s likely because I’m missing lots in direct and indirect conversations and not sleeping as well because tinnitus has ramped up x10🫤

Hope that you are able to find an answer. I’ve experienced similar issues since my loss started in 2022. It deteriorated a bit more rapidly in 2023. By the end of that year I started noticing issues with concentration, focus, and becoming forgetful. Quickly losing track of my thoughts. I’ve received an MRI and CT scan, though nothing was found. I’ve not seen a neurologist yet however. Hoping that once you’re able to see one it provides you with information!

It could be caused by that, but it also could be something different, or a combination of things. Maybe you got a stressful time and need a break, or something.",2025-08-25 15:44:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mzu1rf/immediate_memory_deteriorating_and_difficulty/

1mymy4l,hardofhearing,I just want to completely detach sometimes,"I’m GenX and HoH with a spouse and teenage daughters and I have all the responsibilities etc… but sometimes I just want to drink alcohol in the basement for several days and not even deal with people at all for a little while. I hate it - trying to communicate with people. I’m exhausted trying to deal with them. The thing is, I don’t even have a basement. No one I know has a basement. I live in S. California and no one has basements. But just going full on Hunter S Thompson makes so much sense lately. But I can’t because I have to pay rent and put food in my kids’ mouths. There are no breaks, not even for one evening and I’m exhausted because I can’t effectively communicate with people. It’s a sort of weird isolation, like stuck between 2 worlds where I belong in neither one.

Not the alcohol and basement bit but yeah, disconnecting is high on the list sometimes. My partner has kids who come to stay regularly and they’re wonderful kids but it is exhausting. Between the constant talking/shouting and the talking to me whilst facing away so I can’t hear them or shouting stuff to me from across a field 🙄 I’m either over stimulated or worn out every day. I keep explaining myself to them to try to get it to improve but it doesn’t and I get very irritated. It’s not their fault, they’re just kids but it gets me down. At the end of a week long stay I am grumpy and my partner sees it. We’ve started having to have times when we have the kids where I get to be home alone and decompress. He takes the kids out for a number of hours so that I don’t get constantly worked up. It does help but then I carry the guilt of not wanting to be around the kids. It’s a double edged sword.  Maybe being a drinker would help. 

We don’t have a basement either.

I just space out and don't bother trying to listen sometimes. I figure if it was really important they would make the effort to get my attention and communicate clearly. Its like I don't hear anything if people don't get my attention first and its not that they weren't loud enough for me to pick up sound, its that my brain has somehow learned to tune out conversations I can't hear clearly.  So its being in the room still but also being checked out... its peaceful. And you don't have to hide in a basement drunk to do it.

We have a basement, but it's my husband's man cave and office area and he likes the TV on constantly, so it wouldn't work for escape  I get what you're saying. I'm lucking if I have 1-2hrs of social energy in me even when I'm with friends that I know well and like. It's hard to be 'on' for any length of time and work tends to take most of that time. Then I doomscroll and don't feel much better for it. Hope you figure out something to help you feel more restored.

I can identify with you. I have 2 teen daughters who full on yell when I ask them to repeat themselves. My husband says never mind when I ask him what he said. Sometimes being at home with family feels extremely lonely and isolating. I can’t imaging how I will feel though when they are both gone on their own. Oh, I also want to hide in the basement, but I don’t have one. I hide in my room when I get frustrated.

Also gen X with two teenage daughters. 🙌 I’ve worn hearing aids since age 2.  It’s hard work!   I agree- being in between two worlds is tough.  Not hearing, not Deaf.

I grew up and lived in Southern CA for most of my life. I moved north to Utah and everyone has basements! I work in the basement and have to admit, I do like that space to get away from upstairs activity. It is quieter down here, most of the time.

I'm Gen X and have been wearing hearing aids since '93. I felt between the worlds for a long, long time. I have found my place with a lot of work but I still exhausted with the communication someday. I phase out of the noisy world taking my hearing aids out. Everything fades to mute and if anyone wants to talk to me, they have to use the 3 Golden Rules... Get my attention, face me and be within 6 feet. Hell, they have to use the 3 Golden Rules even with my hearing aids in because they aren't hearing miracles! My hearing aids can only do so much.

Luckily my kids are grown and gone but I remember those tough years and feel for you!

There's a lot of whys behind the 3 Golden Rules so I wrote about it here to help others. They help save my sanity. [https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/](https://hearinglosslive.com/3-golden-rules/)

1mw3vvi,hardofhearing,Struggling with hearing loss and feeling left out—how do you handle it?,"Hi, I’m a 25-year-old woman living in Korea. My English isn’t very good, so I got some help from ChatGPT. In Korea, I’m not officially considered hearing impaired, but I do wear hearing aids. My tinnitus started when I was in high school, and I began wearing hearing aids as an adult. At first, I only wore one, but now I wear them in both ears. Currently, my hearing level is around 55 decibels in each ear.

I started wondering what kind of jobs people with hearing loss have, and how they cope in situations where they can’t fully understand conversations—like when meeting new people or being in noisy places. Do you let others know about your hearing loss from the beginning, or do you just try to manage? I’d really like to hear about others’ experiences and opinions.

Personally, whenever I have to interact with people or go outside, I get really nervous without even realizing it. Once I get used to it, I feel better, but there was a time when I’d come home completely drained and exhausted. I can hear sounds, but I often don’t understand what people are saying. After asking them to repeat themselves a few times, I’ve had people frown or just stop talking to me, which made me feel small and discouraged. Talking on the phone is also very difficult for me. Once, a family member even told me, “Why should I talk louder just for you? My throat hurts,” which really hurt.

Honestly, I don’t know how I’m supposed to live going forward, and it all feels so overwhelming.

It sounds like our experienoes are very similar in many ways.

My hearing loss is pretty much in that range. Everything you wrote really speaks to me. I’m older &amp; grew up without any support and without understanding that my problems were mostly related to hearing loss.  I’m happy for you that you understand the issue so early.

The first thing that helped me was realizing that the nervousness was due to difficulties processing and trying to understand without being able to hear everything. Once i understood that, things got a bit better, i realized that it was my hearing loss rather than some deeper personality problem.

Honestly, i haven’t solved everything, so i’m interested to see what other reddit users suggest, but here are some things that have helped me:
1. i stopped expecting myself to function normally in situations where i can’t hear well. Sometimes i need a break. So it’s okay for me to not try to get every conversation, or to go do my own thing.
2. I tell people that i am looking forward to talking to them, but that i’m hard of hearing and won’t get everything
3. I try to find opportunities to chat with people one-on-one.
4. I try to control the hearing environment: 
5. I learned sign language. This has been amazing for me. I can finally communicate without the struggle to hear. I’m only limited by my skill, which will gontinue to improve while my hearing continues to get worse. The more i learn, the more i identify with the Deaf community.
6. MIFI microphones (that send sound directly to my hearing aids) or iphone’s live-listen feature allows me to hear 100% of one-on-one conversations and more of the group conversations. If i avoid places with a lot of background noise or reverb, it can be considerably better.
7. Communication with my family. They used to think i was a jerk for interupting or ignoring them, or for controlling conversations. They are slowly realizing that while i’m not perfect, a lot of the communication issues are actually a result of my hearing loss.
8. Learning more about hearing loss and how it affects people. This reddit channel has helped a lot. There are also some good books on life with hearing loss, but i’m not sure many of those are in Korean, but it looks like there are some, such as •	『나는 청각 장애를 가진 심리 상담사』  that might be interesting.
I’ll come back and write some more if I think of anything, but the fact that you’re searching for answers is the most important thing!
I’m curious, what have you found to be helpful?

It has been a bit of a journey for me. When I was first diagnosed at 18, my hearing loss was 45-55dB in both ears. I felt shame wearing my hearing aids and instead of telling people I have hearing loss, did a lot of masking, pretending, mirroring people like laugh when people laughed, nodding like an idiot when I did not understand. At work, I never said anything. My line of work is emotionally/mentally draining by nature and the listening fatigue did not make it easier, for sure.

With the support of a hearing therapist, I have gained confidence about disclosing my hearing loss, I have progressed in my career and recently gained another qualification in a profession where listening is a huge part of the work. My hearing loss now ranges between 55dB to 80 dB but I consistently tell people about my hearing loss and what I need, even at work. I ask for adjustments to reduce listening fatigue and prioritise self-care so I do not burn out.

Wearing hearing aids is only a partial solution, they do help us hear better but do not make us hear the same as ""normal"". It has been a long journey to accepting this. Even with the latest technology and gadgets, adjustments and other strategies are needed. Once I made peace with this idea, I worked on understanding what strategies helped me in different situations, experimenting with how sound works - like where I sit, what type of room. If it is too noisy, just switch off the HAs or if it is for a conversation, ask people to move somewhere quieter etc.

What I found is that the more confident and assertive I have become around my hearing loss and adjustment needs, the less rude and dismissive people are. They likely see it through our body language. I still have areas I need to work on, undoubtedly but even though my hearing loss is gradually but surely approaching the profound range, ironically, I feel better about myself now than when I had mild-moderate hearing loss.

I am aware than different countries, different cultures may have different attitudes toward disability and this will influence how we feel, think and relate to others. Part of the journey for me has been to push boundaries one tiny step at a time. The times when I felt/feel exasperated and exhausted of educating people are numerous but I remind myself that even without hearing loss, we need to manage differences with others.

I inherited my hearing loss. I grew up with people saying “never mind” after the third repetition of what they said. It’s particularly hurtful when it’s the punchline of a joke that I never get to know what it was. 

That “never mind” feels and is dismissive. Plus, it reinforces my self concept of not belonging with other people or groups. I feel excluded, especially when I need to set up a favorable environment that creates “extra work” for them. 

I recently learned that when people say “never mind” that our response should be something like “Please, I really would like to hear what you have to say. Do you mind trying once more?”

I have not tried this approach yet. 

[Never Mind article](https://livingwithhearingloss.com/2015/05/26/please-dont-say-never-mind/)

Tell yourself it doesn’t matter what you don’t hear. It’s a shift in mindset from the assumption that we need to hear everything. Hearing Aid industry promotes that idea that we are broken so we go buy their products to be “fixed”. Accept yourself. Reject that which you are not and cannot be.

Use captions for all the calls. For mobile pixel has good captions.

You're not alone with that experience! It's actually even a common situation for people with hearing loss. There are even studies about the correlations of hearing loss and social isolation.
I personally am very honest about my hearing loss and tell people about me being hard of hearing. It's making things clear for people, so they know what's going on if I need to ask them to repeat things more often.
Also, I can tell them about what it's like to not hear everything, if they want to learn more about it. Creating a bit of awareness, that helps to avoid misunderstandings on both sides. Because most people don't know much about being hard of hearing, what exactly is damaged in the ear, and how the little machines in my ears work.

I’m here seeking for answers too, so I am so sorry if I couldn’t give you exact solution to this problem. 

However, I want to say that I hear you. Everything you say is relatable because I experienced what you experience too.

1mvj6z9,hardofhearing,Is there an app or program to turn phone calls into text!,"Good morning! I have joined this community because my mom is profoundly hard of hearing— unless she is face-to-face with you, She is completely deaf. She is having some health issues and has had issues getting phone calls to schedule appointments and things like that. I was wondering if there is any app or program that could be put on a phone or her tablet that can turn a phone call into text while she speaks to them and then she can respond back verbally? Any help is appreciated.

Location? Innocaption is only in the US because it’s paid for by the FCC.

Phone call captioning is built into both mobile operating systems now:

iPhone

https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-live-captions-of-spoken-audio-iphe0990f7bb/ios

Android

https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en

It does require the use of a headset so you can see the screen. I have my ""action button"" on my iPhone set to Live Caption so I can pull them up with one click. 

One downside of the iPhone version (idk if Android or Innocaption are different) is that it only captions the other person, it doesn't caption your own speech. I'm used to captioning on Zoom and other video calls that captions everything, so it's a little weird.

I've been using two phones, one an old pixel phone with the recorder app to record the call  and it does transcription

and the newer pixel to do the actual call using the speakerphone function and the caption call option turned on.

but it seems the other suggestions here are better than what I've been doing.

1mv026q,hardofhearing,Popping in ears for three years,"Back in 2023, I got very sick while traveling (possibly covid) and ever since then I’ve had persistent popping and fullness in my ears when I swallow or talk. I also have hearing loss from former deployments and the popping makes hearing much more difficult. Sometimes it wakes me up at night. Doctors keep saying it’s allergies and gave me meds that didn’t work. I feel like they don’t take it seriously. No matter what climate I’m in, it never lessens. I’ve never had allergies or trouble with ear fullness before this issue appeared. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

[댓글]
I had what I believed to be a popping ear, and it turned out there was a small dog hair inside my ear canal that kept rubbing on my ear drum. My doctor took a waterpik (one of those water flosser things) and flooded my ear with water for an extended period of time. The little hair finally dislodged, and my ear popping stopped.

Have you seen an ENT? I wonder if it’s related to your Eustachian tubes.

Had this too. My ENT checked Eustachian tube function - all fine. Eventually the audiologist tested the pressure in my ears and found that my eardrums didn’t move when under pressure suggesting something in behind. Few weeks later they gave me grommets because sprays etc just hadn’t worked. The surgeon said that when he made the incision into the eardrum it was “full of mucus and crap” 8 weeks later and it’s clearing so so much. 

Worth asking this question.

1mun0cl,hardofhearing,Headphone Volume while hearing-impaired,"I have hearing loss and I wear bte hearing aids.I live with my family and I want to play games/watching shows at midnight.So I would remove my hearing aids to wear my headset.However, I am worried about would the volume damage my ear even I have hearing loss already(You can barely hear it while you are not wearing them) .
So I want to ask will my ears be redamaged if I have too loud volume in my headset even I do not feel loud for me?

Do your hearing aids have a Bluetooth feature? That’s what I do. 

Yes, the loud volume can do more damage to your ears. Me personally, as a kid I never worried about out it because it was the only way I could listen to music.

Be careful with this for sure. I've gotten myself in a paradox a few times where I turn music or games up loud enough to sound as loud as I remember from before hearing loss. Because I now have significant loss, if I do that, it means I'm listening to the music \*way\* louder than I should be, which then causes additional hearing loss, and cycles. 

It's a pretty safe bet that if you have bad loss, whatever sounds loud to you now will make that loss worse.

Does your brand of hearing aids make a device that hooks up to your TV and streams into your hearing aids.. I wear Widex Moment HAs and I have 2 devices for this.. One is a TV-DEX that hooks up to the optical out port on my TV and streams the audio from my TV directly to my HAs and the other is a COM-DEX that does the same with my computer.  I use the computer one for work to listen to Zoom/Teams calls and YT videos, but I'm sure it would work for gaming..  I know the TV DEX works for gaming, I've used it with my Xbox on that TV.

You can get volume-limiting headphones. I have a pair of IsoTunes Bluetooth ear buds that limits the volume to 79 dB with no microphone. There is another version with a microphone that limits the volume to 85 dB.

Yes, you should stream the sound to the hearing aids instead.

The headphones aren’t adjusted to your hearing loss. So either you won’t hear the sound correctly at those frequencies you have a lot of hearing loss in, or you increase the volume but then get too loud sound for those frequencies you don’t have a lot of hearing loss in.

Why not talk to your audiologist?

I have been using Shokz, bone conduction headphones. Since they use your skull instead of your ears to transmit the sound, there is like no risk of further loss.

This would be a good question for your audiologist. My hearing is such that my audiologist said listen to whatever I want to because it's not going to make my hearing any worse. But that is specific to my loss which is Progressive and genetic in origin so I'm going to go completely deaf eventually anyway. Also as far as music and audiobooks or anything you run through your phone you can get a app with an equalizer and use your audiogram to invert it into the equalizer and that should allow you to equalize your hearing so when you do turn the volume up it works better.  You may even be able to purchase an equalizer for your TV and gaming system and run your headphones through that. One last thought on the behind the ear versus in the ear is to consider how easy it is to lose and in the ear versus the behind the ear. I've had hearing aids for 40 years and the in the ear ones are horrible if you just set them down without thinking about it and forget where you put them. If you think hunting for car keys is difficult wait till you misplace one of those itty bitty in the ear ones. At this point I have the colored inserts for my behind the ears so that at least I have a chance of seeing them.

Yeah, high volume is something you have to be mindful of. I have a program called ""Equalizer APO"" on my PC, that I use to adjust the sound to my needs. It's not perfect, but it does a bit of what the hearing aids do and allows me to have a more normal volume on the headset.",2025-08-19 16:16:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mun0cl/headphone_volume_while_hearingimpaired/
1mttfyg,hardofhearing,Recently Diagnosed,"So I am 25f and I was diagnosed within the last three months. I never understood why people cry when they got hearing aids until I was crying. I had a trail run for hearing aids for a week and I miss being able to hear. I have to constantly say that I’m hard of hearing and for others to speak up. Sometimes I don’t know if I’m yelling or not and I am so exhausted from my job 3/5 days (2/5 days I have less interaction with people) so any help as to either getting through the day without hearing fatigue or gaining access to good hearing aids that don’t cost $6,000 it would really help. I’m about it absolutely loose it.

First, you should speak to an audiologist about your options. Do not get OTC hearing aids they will make your hearing worse. Sometimes, your dr has to really go to bat for you to get your covered like mine did . With my insurance, I got my hearing aid for free ( costs was 4k)  as it was covered on my insurance ( they just didnt want to pay it.) Do u have insurance? The cost out of pocket could be less. Also, ask if you're a candidate for Cochelar Implants. My insurance covered that except the initial consultation. I got one CI on one ear and a hearing aid on the right ear. Im going in for another consultation for the right ear to get a ci put in there because the CI beats the hearing aid by miles. Ex. Clarity, volume, no pain on/inside the ears, etc. I know the struggle and the exhaustion of trying to strain yourself to try to hear. Its annoying and drives u and everyone around u crazy trying to communicate.
For reference of what aid I have:
RESOUND hearing aid and Cochelar nucleus 8

Are you in America? If so, reach out to your state's Vocational Rehabilitation center. they can help with financing the hearing aids, especially since it's something that makes your job easier! don't try and do over-the-counter ones, Sam's Club, CostCo, etc.; go with what your audiologist advises. I have Phonak Marvels for a severe-profound hearing loss and absolutely love them. but again, reach out to your local Voc Rehab and they should be able to help you

Personally I’ve been hard of hearing for 50 years since a baby. Got hearing aid at 5 years old. Hate them. I tailor my life to not have to need them. I have simple Driving job. Listen to podcasts all day. Figure out how to be yourself instead of how to fit in according to societies expectations. That is too exhausting.

1mtsjli,hardofhearing,What do I call myself?,"Back in January, I had what doctors believe was an intralabyrinthine hemorrhage and lost basically all of the hearing in my left ear. Since then, I've been trying to figure out what is proper to say when describing myself?

Would I say that I'm ""half deaf"" since I cannot hear at all out of one ear? Or is it more proper to just say that I'm hard of hearing? Or does it not matter, and this is a silly thing to be worried about?

[댓글]
Deaf is a spectrum and your label is your choice. When introducing yourself or reminding people, I would say “Deaf in my left ear” or the right ear is the good ear. Just something so people know how to communicate with you. If you say “half deaf” people tend to just talk twice as loud, which doesn’t help.

I struggled with this...am I ""hard of hearing"" or ""I can't hear well""...I decided I'm just hearing impaired. That usually suffices.

It doesn’t matter - I have a moderate hereditary bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.  The only thing I won’t call myself is deaf, because that can imply not hearing at all or membership in a particular group.

I say hard of hearing when I’m just being casual.  I say hearing impaired when I need the other person to quickly understand they need to speak up, though I also just tell people “I wear hearing aids” to make things clear sometimes because I’m still young-looking and my hearing is still good enough that I “pass” as normal hearing.

If you have a hard time hearing because of hearing loss but don’t have total loss then you’re hard of hearing.

I say “deaf in one ear,” unilaterally deaf is the technical term.

How you describe yourself is entirely up to you. You might get some comments if you say ""hearing impaired"" (it's my preferred term, I actually hate saying ""hard of hearing"", though I do it for others out of respect for them), but you are an autonomous individual with the right to call yourself as you wish. 

I used to say ""half deaf"", but now I just say ""little-d deaf"". 

Imo, using more technical terms helps with people understanding the severity of the situation. ""I don't hear well"" is often met with ""oh, I don't either."" 

But also, I'm so sorry, that's a lot of change to deal with.

I used to say hearing impaired, but I now think hard of hearing is more accurate.  I wouldn’t use deaf, because I can get close to “normal” with hearing aids.

Say whatever you want though. Nobody really cares, or at least they shouldn’t.

My usual intro: “Hey, my ears are trash. It helps if you speak up and make sure I can see you when you’re talking. Thanks!”

I tell folks I’ve lost the hearing on my right side.

""I have a hard time hearing and wear hearing aids.""   
That's all they need to know. And if they're especially tuned in, they'll ask for clarification. ""I'm hard of hearing, stay to my left side. Hearing aids aren't perfect but I get by.""",2025-08-18 17:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mtsjli/what_do_i_call_myself/
1mtr8dp,hardofhearing,Hearing aid quote,"I have congenital hearing loss, and was recently retested with moderately severe hearing loss (~60db both ears, as expected). The audiologist recommended a set of either Phonak or Oticon receiver-in-ear aids for $7300, and it would include all future visits/adjustments for the life of the equipment. I have zero insurance coverage in my policy for hearing aids. I'm in my 40s, and this is my first time looking into getting hearing aids due to the cost, and I'm still feeling some sticker shock. They didn't provide details about the specific models, but indicated the Phonak (which I preferred) had a 2nd microchip for managing background, would be water resistant for exercise, and have bluetooth connectivity, so maybe it is the Audeo Life Paradise; but the purchase costs for a pair seem much lower online?  I liked the sound quality during the test, and the center is well-rated/reviewed in my area, but it felt like a ""these 2 are your only options, pick them up next week"" hard-sell kind of experience.

Does that price seem unreasonable for my level of loss and the ongoung support/office visits? Or is it worth shopping around? 

[댓글]
I paid $6,000.00 for mine so I'm not entirely surprised by the cost. Do you have a Costco near you? They can be significantly cheaper.

If you're in the US check out Ebay. People sell used Hearing Aids on there quite a bit. Sometimes they sell new ones from India they're still phonak or oticon or other brands but the prices are a lot more reasonable. I've done this maybe three or four times and not had much of a problem. Even if you run into a problem, if you can get a pair for a couple hundred dollars, it's worth the Gamble. The only thing I would advise if doing something like this is that you make sure you have access to an audiologist who can program them. If they're older models, they may not have the software or the connecting cable, and some audiologists may not work with them just on the principle that they make too much money selling a new one

If you’re in the US and need them to save your job you may benefit from vocational rehabilitation. Medicaid rates though. Seems awfully high.

I paid $4150 for my last pair

Phonak 

I suggest going with a closer audiologist at least for your first pair. You may need multiple sessions to get the best out of the device until you’re comfortable with them an understanding the different options available

Apparently there are some leasing programs available that might work for you.  As a new user you may get very little use out of them at first, at least until you get used to them.

As far as online prices go it's not really fair to compare them with an Audiologist.  Although they may only make about $45/hour they are going to charge you $200/hour.  Since those are included in the cost of your hearing aids over time your free adjustments may be worth the difference in initial price.",2025-08-18 16:40:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mtr8dp/hearing_aid_quote/
1mthpr2,hardofhearing,Help for an audiologist please,"Hey folks 👋

I’m a Doctor of Audiology based in London. About a year ago I started posting on social media as DrYovina (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)- mostly covering the less talked-about side of audiology. Not just hearing aid reviews (though I throw a few of those in), but also the random misconceptions, weird facts, and things people don’t usually get told about ears and hearing.

I want it to actually be useful rather than just me rambling, so if there are topics you’d like explained, myths you’ve heard, or anything ear/hearing related you’ve always wondered about, drop me a suggestion. Would love to make content that people genuinely find helpful.

Cheers!

How to understand your results. I’m one of the people who would take a test you run and ask zero questions because I was raised in a cult and have no idea how to ask what your tests mean.

How to take HoH and Deaf more seriously. I love technology, enjoy hearing, and I do appreciate all the opportunities that exist today, but there definitely is an overemphasis on hearing being the only way to communicate, get social inclusion and prevent dementia. There are many things that are harmful with this worldview:

* What happens to those who can’t get a CI? The health care system seems to totally ignore these people’s situation, because they can’t fix the problem through medical means. Those who aren’t helped by the development we have today, they also deserve communication and inclusion. This group is getting worse and worse conditions and no one seems to understand how important it is to have solid language access and inclusion even when spoken language is not accessible. 

* We HoH are **always** at a disadvantage every time we have to listen, even with the best technology. The person with normal hearing will always be able to hear more in social situations. The consequences of that are devastating. We are always judged by our ability to hear anytime we communicate. That’s not fair. Allow us and encourage us to use communication that is 100% accessible to us, like sign language or text. 

Hearing is a great tool, and necessary and convenient in a hearing society, but I think there should be much more emphasis on how to actually allow us to communicate on more equal terms. We shouldn’t be forced to rely on our weakest sense all the time.

Can you really lose hearing from a virus?

Differences in symptoms between HoH and sensory processing issues, and the correlation. In really simple terms.

Hi, will tinnitus and over-sensitivity in my ear go away? Six months ago I got hearing damage caused by a sudden, loud sound. My audiogram shown a big notch at 6-8khz, reaching to 8dB. Now it's at 60dB. What's worse, I've had tinnitus since then and this ear became super sensitive to louder or higher sounds. When a sound is above a certain volume level, it's kind of distorted and if it's from 6-8khz range, it's painful. I was wrongly diagnosed and started recovery process too late (I went through HBOT only after 2 months after the accident).

Other than that I don't really feel much difference in hearing in my every day life.

Tinnitus, though, usually gets quieter when I rest or go to sleep, it's not constant or harsh but still annoying. It has got better since the beginning but it's still really annoying. I was told many times by doctors that the hearing loss is irreversable but my audiologist said that tinnitus and over-sensitivity will likely go away (may take up to a year) but I don't really know. I think it's more of a mental struggle.

I would like to hear your opinion on that.",2025-08-18 09:57:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/1mthpr2/help_for_an_audiologist_please/
