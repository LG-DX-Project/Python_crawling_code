1oyzevy,deaf,Do you google the lyrics when subtitles name the song playing in a scene?,"Hi,

I’m watching a show with the volume on low while someone’s sleeping so I had the subtitles showing. 

On one of the more impactful scenes a song began playing with both the track name and artist being included in the subtitles. I was wondering if a a deaf person would bother to look up the lyrics to know whether it adds to the scene/vibe or not, or if you wouldn’t bother. 

Personally I could see myself doing it a couple of times every now and then but generally being too lazy or indifferent.",2025-11-16 22:37:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oyzevy/do_you_google_the_lyrics_when_subtitles_name_the/

1oyj054,deaf,"A sensitive communication issue in my new relationship F22, M25","I’m a 22-year-old hearing woman. I grew up using British Sign Language because a close family member is deaf. Through a mutual friend, I met my boyfriend let’s call him Alex 25. He has profound sensorineural hearing loss and has never had any auditory reference.. We mainly communicate in BSL  and he’s also a great lip-reader.
We’ve been together for a few months and things have been wonderful. He’s kind, emotionally intelligent and our connection is very strong. As the relationship has become more physically close, I’ve run into a problem I didn’t expect.
Alex makes involuntary vocalisations during intimate moments. There’s nothing wrong with that, but the specific pitch of the sound is extremely high to my hearing brain, it’s almost identical to the whimper of a distressed animal. It instantly pulls me out of the moment and I find myself unable to focus because my mind automatically interprets it as something being wrong. It’s not him it’s just my reaction to that specific tone.
The issue is that I have absolutely no way to say “adjust it” because he has no concept of pitch or tone. These noises  they’re possibly reflexive. I’m terrified of hurting his feelings or making him self-conscious about something he can’t control or even fully understand. He’s a wonderful partner and this isn’t something I’d ever break up over.
I tried wearing transparent silicone earplugs once, based on a friend’s suggestion, but they didn’t block the sound enough, and I don’t want to risk him noticing them.
How can I approach this conversation in a way that’s respectful and doesn’t make him feel judged or embarrassed?",2025-11-16 11:04:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oyj054/a_sensitive_communication_issue_in_my_new/
1oyh38d,deaf,When people think you are rude but you are just deaf,"I’m a teacher and the first thing I tell them is that I’m deaf. I work on lip reading and can hear loud noises. I never got a long with hearing aids. At the start of a new year the first thing I tell my students is that I’m deaf. If I am not looking at you I am not listening and to get my attention you need to shout my name. 

Anyway it’s something that frustrates the hell out of my partner. My deafness is new (only diagnosed a few years ago) and I was not deaf when we met. I acquired it after meningitis. He says I never listen to him but no matter how much I tell him he needs to get my attention before he starts talking to me he just doesn’t. Anyway he’s got sick and his ears are blocked. All of a sudden he’s me and now from my side he’s getting annoyed at me because I’m talking and he’s not listening because his ears are blocked. I’m trying to get him to empathise with my constant state but he’s not. 

A lot of people at work think I’m rude because I walk past them when they try talk to me. I feel I need a sign around my neck saying “I’m deaf shout my name to activate conversation mode”.

My job is to talk to people 1-1 in meetings, some group meetings occasionally, and admin work, but there's no reason why the meetings would ever need to be in person. I really find it much easier when it's remote and the live captions are there without needing CART, and with everything being amplified even if the client has a soft voice or accent. Everyone seems to have great microphones and equipment at home and it's so much easier for me to hear them when they are remote and I can discreetly adjust settings based on if I want to try to hear (if captions aren't working) or if I want to just read the captions. Being remote doesn't impact my work as much since I don't have to disclose or request repeats, and it's way less fatiguing.

I've submitted documentation from my doctor and my audiologist about the limitations of hearing aids and impacts of auditory fatigue. It's been several weeks but I've yet to hear back from them. I'm hoping I can ask others for their experiences and arguments for working from home - I really don't feel heard or supported by my HR. They've simply just, not responded.

I'm just curious what these signs are advocating, protesting, notifying, or any of it. Is it about a local issue with LSQ accessibility? It's also possible there are signs missing.

1ox9srg,deaf,"Workplace Accomodations, USA","Question: How can I go about getting accomodations or protection in the work place as I am losing my ability to hear spoken English? Do I just get a letter from my audiologist and give it to HR? (Pennsylvania, USA)

Story Time: I've always had a hard time understanding speech and that came with speech delays, homeschooling and special ed, lots of audiologist visits, and an APD diagnosis at 7. I was able to struggle through and mostly pass as hearing for quite a while. Then I had head injuries and noise exposure and just in general am getting tired of pretending understand and taking the blame for not understanding. 

I got suspended from my previous job for ""ignoring"" my supervisor who would inaudibly (to me) talk to me from her desk across the room in a very hectic work center without getting my attention. 

I left that job and decided to go back to school for nursing, but in the meantime I started a new job cleaning a nursing home and am realizing how fast I'm losing hearing. I can't mop a floor and listen to instructions at the same time. I need to stop and lip read and that makes my supervisor angry, she thinks I'm trying to be lazy. I thought that may mean I couldn't be a nurse, but with some research it seems plenty of deaf/HoH people have entered the medical field. 

I start a two year RN program in January and would like to show up being completely honest, with paperwork already in hand.

I have an audiologist appointment on the 18th, next week. 

For now, I think all I need is for people to get my attention and face me while speaking. But I'm sure there is more to it.

I'm new to ASL but learning fast.

I'm also open to ideas for different job fields. Education was a close competitor to nursing, but I'm not sure what else I would want to do. I spent 10 years in weapons technology and am somewhat considering returning to the field, but I think I'd like to do something that is more service oriented and not killing people.

Reach out to Vocational Rehabilitation in your state. They not only help people to get employment but also help people to retain gainful employment.  Be tenacious, these are government agencies and can be clouded with red-tape and obtuse people. 

Having a signed note from your doctor to take to HR is good. They may have you go through all kinds of hoops that seem really silly and a waste of time, do that. Fill out the silly forms and whatever you got to do. It's how you'll cover your ass, and it's needed because HR's job is to cover the companies ass. Just remind yourself that HR is not your friend, they're there to protect the company, not you.  What accommodations look like is going to vary greatly depending on the work you do.  You might want to think about past work you've done and how the problems you've had could have been eliminated if your supervisor had just done something simple like, made sure you were facing them when they spoke to you. (for example) 

Do all of this quickly, you don't want to sit on this kind of thing.  In the short term though just have matter of fact and calm conversations with the people you work with.  Don't ever apologize for being deaf/hoh and always speak in a way that's ""accommodation forward""  talk about positive things that you need to do your job well.  You don't always have to know exactly every detail of an accommodation from the get-go, hopefully the people you work with aren't total shit-heads.

Your audiologist and any applicable hearing devices will be your best bet *for now* while you’re learning ASL. Realistically, it will take a couple years at minimum until you’re fluent enough to discuss medical concepts in your second language. 

Also… plenty of deafies in the medical field. 

Well… not plenty. But more and more everyday! I’ve seen a handful of medical students commenting on this sub, I’m a paramedic, I follow a couple nurses on social media… slowly but surely we are getting here! You’re a welcome member and I hope you continue with nursing.

You've already gotten some good suggestions. Start with what accommodations you think you need, such as visual or tactile methods of gaining your attention first, written instructions, or whatever else you need.

1ox79jw,deaf,Deaf and Disabled Resource Hunt,"So brief context: I have a variety of disabilities but am not deaf or close to the Deaf community, and very much consider myself disabled (autism, adhd, eds, chronic pain and fatigue)  
  
 Since I learned that a decent portion of the Deaf community, its been hard for me to wrap my head around how they don't consider it a disability.  Being autistic, I consider my autism a net gain for me and wouldn't desire a ""cure"" even if it was free. However, I still consider it a disability.  Even in a perfect society, sometimes my body is overstimulating and exhausting for me to possess, so while it isn't an experience I would trade away, it is disabling.

I've done some research and have learned that this is mostly a result of historical oppression, but I keep finding random short pieces of information on places like reddit, but those people must have learned that somewhere.  Could y'all point me to legit sources/articles for this kind of information? I'd also take whatever you know but don't want to ask people to explain as that has been done here many times already

Deafness is a unique disability in that it has a language and a culture derived from that language. Many culturally deaf people adopt the societal view of disability, in that it’s only the fact that hearing people don’t sign that creates “disability” for deaf people.

Obviously this is not the case for all deaf people but that’s a reason deafness is not like MS or autism or anything else.

Personally, I ***hate*** the term *disabled* - really fucking loathe it - but I will admit, as someone who was seriously ill at birth, is autistic ( probably with other additional needs ), and came close to requiring a wheelchair, as well as being deaf / HoH, I am probably classified as such, in line with the Equality Act 2010. Do I love the fact I’m disabled? No. Do I consider myself disabled ***because*** I am ‘deaf’? Absolutely not.

Pretty much any current Deaf culture books have good explanations of this.

hi! so i think this is something where theres a range of perspectives within the community AND so complex. 

we know there is a medical view of disability, but also a social view. in the social view, we understand that IF everyone was Deaf, it would not be a disability. the world would be set up for us.

that said, in this world, i still identify as disabled (i have other disabilities, but i do include my hearing loss). i find it validating in a sense. in a hearing world, i need accommodations. i struggle sometimes and i feel better understanding that its not a reflection of me. 

thats not the case for everyone, and being Deaf is certainly different in the sense of culture, community, and wanting to continue that. many other disabilities would love a cure (and valid, i have lupus and would love that), but Deaf folks just dont have that sense. i HOPE my kids are Deaf because i love that part of myself. 

its nuanced, but thats my general feeling 🤟🏻

I am Deaf and autistic, and I feel I can explain this well.

Deaf with a capital D means being part of Deaf culture. It’s characterized by being deaf, using sign, and seeing deafness as positive or neutral. Hearing loss can be disabling, but that happens when we do not have access. Many of us who see it as non disabling have access to Deaf spaces that support us, full languages and expressive communities and cultures.

Outside those spaces, I am disabled compared to the people around me. Inside a space that fits me, I am as capable as anyone else. When I am in a room of Deaf people, I feel normal. The same thing happens when I am in a room of autistic people.

I think many autistic people understand this idea. Autism has been treated as something negative for a long time. The community has dealt with bias, oppression, and fewer choices.

There is already a strong autistic culture. I have often felt that if autistic people had a shared language that many of us used, it would be treated the same way signed languages and Deaf culture are treated. 

People would focus only on the medical view. They would see the language as lesser. They would misrepresent it in media. They might even restrict it in formal settings. This is only a hypothetical language, yet autistic people already face these problems, especially people who do not use speech and rely on other forms of communication.

https://www.abebooks.com/9781482315653/Deaf-Tips-Twelve-lessons-world-1482315653/plp

Here are two books to start you off. 

I think of a lot(not all) of disability stuff as situational. In a regular coffee shop with a lot of chatter, I have a hard time hearing. I'm the ""disabled"" one. In a bar or dance club, I can lip-read better, hearies can't. They're the ""disabled"" ones. 
Very often disabilities are simply limitations in the environment. Correct the environment and the disability disappears. Obviously not always but a surprisingly amount. A blind friend and I often compared notes and honestly, the hardest thing for both of us was dealing with able bodied people. 

In terms of not seeing it as a disability, one thing that happened a lot to me is in job that had a physical aspect, I excelled. Simply because hearing people have no idea how often they stop what they're doing when they start talking. I tuned them out and always kept working and at the end of the day, my pile would be much higher and they were always baffled at how ""quick"" I was. It had nothing to do with speed. I just didn't waste time yakking. The thing is, if it's just all hearing people, they think it's normal, not inefficient.

I am of the opinion that just as deafness wouldn't be considered a disability socially if everyone could sign, other diagnosis as autism or ADHD wouldn't be considered disabilities socially if the world was built to accomodate those needs.

Symptoms seem to fit Ménières, but for the last year or so, my hearing has actually improved, rather than deteriorating further…? 

I’m under ENT and they’ve requested repeat scans in March 2026. It seems as though they’re putting my loss down to a mix of things -  including genetics ( to some extent ), and a previous congenital condition - but I’ve only ever been diagnosed ( at least by the NHS ) as having Bilateral Mild-Moderate Sensorineural hearing loss. 

Stupidly, it took me a while to get a hearing test - on the High Street,results of which were 40-45% loss in one ear, around 25% loss in the other - so I reckon I could have originally sustained Moderate-Severe loss…? 

I guess my question is does stabilisation / possible improvement fits a Ménières diagnosis…?

Do you have problems with vertigo or balance? Sometimes Ménières disease can seem like an idiopathic catch all. But if the doctor doesn't tell you that you have it, don't assume.

1ox2yi3,deaf,When did you stop feeling self-conscious about your hearing,"When I first got my hearing aids, I was so self-conscious about them. I’d constantly adjust my hair, make sure it wasn’t showing, and even avoid mentioning it if someone asked about what I was wearing. For some reason, I had it in my head that people would see them and immediately think something was “wrong” with me.

It took a while, but I eventually realized… no one notices. Friends, coworkers, and even people I talk to face-to-face rarely say anything. The few who do usually just think they’re earbuds. Once that sunk in, I stopped hiding them and started feeling more confident wearing them every day.

[댓글]
If it helps, they are not a bad look, and people don't really think about others as much as people think about themselves. Wear them with confidence!!!

I've always been seen as being ""bad"" by hearing people because they think I'm disrespectful for not hearing them. I wish hearing aids would work for me so they could see something is ""wrong"" with me! Simply my hearing, not my attitude.

I’m long past that stage. You want people to notice. If they don’t understand you’re Hard of Hearing, which is a perfectly normal explanation, they assume you’re stupid, intentionally rude, ignorant and unsocial. Being open about your hearing loss and learning to advocate for yourself is a key to better relationships with hearing people.

The first time I put them on and realized just how much I had been missing.

Honestly it wasn't until I became an adult, that being said most people within the past 10-ish years assume they're just ear buds. I remember as a teenager I wore them exactly once to school and my friend pointed them out (well meaning, I don't blame her or anything) which caused me to never wear them to school again! lol

but these days (I'm 27 now) I'm all about making them as noticeable as possible which oddly helped a lot? I shaved the sides of my head because they would get tangled constantly and literally have to rip my hair out to save them, so I started doing flashy things like specific jewelry made for them and fun colors/stickers!

It was when someone told me to keep my hair down because my hearing aids were ugly. I was in my 20s. And something inside me said no. I was told my whole life to be discreet about my deafness. But that day, something just snapped. I kept my hair up and ignored her. Soon after I got tattoos by my ears to highlight my aids even more.

It’s been 40 years, I’m sure it will happen any day now. 

Realistically humans are always self conscious about something. I’m not always self conscious about it but I will sometimes have incidents of bad communication that will make me so frustrated and aware of how people probably see me.

The only folks I’ve had notice mine also had them.

I’m still embarrassed if I can’t hear people and I’m 40. It happens a lot 😅

I hope this won't be insensitive, but as a neuro-enthusiast having read a lot about auditory neuro and considered optometry as a kid, I think hearing aids genuinely rock. Whenever I see them, I get a little excited. I'm also researching about hearing-aid stigma as a psych student - it sucks that you felt self-conscious. :-(

I never really was, but from the moment I got my first pair in second grade, I always made sure they matched my hair color. I was always the only person in my class who was Hard of Hearing and wore hearing aids. Back then kids in my class saw that as different and would point out that to me despite them being hidden. I remember one person tell me during recess I that if I want people to hang out with me I shouldn’t smile all the time like I used to do at the time and not wear my hearing aids. Basically trying to get me to change who I am, as in their eyes I was the weird kid. At the time agreed with the smiling, but I told them that I needed my hearing aids to hear and they back off making any more comments as they assume I couldn’t function without them. Thus, cementing the fact I shouldn’t have them stand out. Once I got into to middle school/high school no one commented on my hearing aids, as I really didn’t hangout with anyone or have friends, was just focusing on school. Now that I am an adult it doesn’t bother me anymore, I am actually happy I have my hearing aids and love them as I feel just like everybody else. I don’t have anyone pointing out my hearing aids and get treated respectfully. In fact one of ear hooks is blue like the old Walmart shopping bags instead of my usual clear as that all the audiologist had and it was either that or risk losing my hearing aids, yet no one has ever pointed it out. So for me it just took time and realize that there are just going to be people who just don’t understand Deaf and Hard of Hearing culture, and no one actually cares about fitting in or having it be a reason not to hang with someone.

When you turn 50, you stop giving a shit about many things. I use my hearing aids to my advantage whenever I can, I am not a fortunate man, so my hearing aids sometimes get me pity pass and I'm ok with that.

I only got my hearing aid last year and aren't self conscious about it. It's not inconspicuous!

I never had it bother me once. I was born deaf and got my hearing aids at I think 18 months old.  I only became aware that some deaf people were different when I was in middle elementary school and found some other students who didn't talk and couldn't understand me. 

1970s were a different time, some adults still ignored deaf children but I was among the early toddlers to get into verbal communication program.

When I first got my Heardirectclub Nova hearing aids, I was super self-conscious too. I’d try to hide them, fuss with my hair, and even avoid talking about them because I thought people would judge.
Over time, I realized almost nobody even notices. Friends and coworkers rarely say anything, and if they do, they often just think they’re earbuds ( in-ear design). Once I accepted that, I stopped hiding them and now I wear my hearing aids confidently every day.

The problem is… my current job has been really kind to me. They even gave me 3 weeks off (2 weeks paid) so I could focus on my sports hobbies, and they’ve always wished me well. I feel guilty about leaving after they’ve treated me so nicely.

How do I tell them I’ve accepted another job and plan to leave — in the nicest, most respectful way possible?

[댓글]
Congratulations on your new opportunity! That’s wonderful, and I hope you will find the new job as supportive and as good for you long-term as you believe it will be. If I were you, I would write a resignation letter that articulates how grateful you are to your current employer for their kindness and their support of you. Tell them how difficult it is to leave and how much you hope that you will be able to stay in touch with them and their team. Then, I would resign in person, saying the same things and leaving the resignation letter with them. I also would be considerate, giving them as much notice as possible (a minimum of 2 weeks, preferably 4, depending on the job and your role). After those things, I would consider bringing something nice to your office on that day, something you think the team would enjoy — brownies, cookies, a cake, flowers. That will let everyone know how grateful you are for their support and the opportunity you’ve had there and how much you appreciate the friendships you’ve made. It also will ensure that you’re able to leave on the best terms possible, and they will appreciate your kindness. Best of luck!! 🍀

[댓글]
Never used a textphone. Have tried RelayUK on mobile in the past but have had some reliability issues. Calls would disconnect and would have to call back, which is extremely frustrating when you get a different person at the other end and have to start over.

Because I was just using it for captioning to support hearing while I spoke back, these days it's more convenient (if less accurate) to just use live caption apps/have a Teams/Zoom call running to provide captions.

I once used a text to speech app, it was painfully slow!, it is a great invention but it does need improving/speeding up, or is it time for a lipreading app for deaf users?.

If I absolutely have to. I hate using it and will go to any length to avoid it. I usually email and ask for communication by email.

1owsjs1,deaf,Smile. In emails,"Hi! I’m still relatively new to learning about the Deaf community (I’m a hearing interpreting student myself) and I’ve recently noticed a commonality in some of the language Deaf people use in emails, particularly when they will end a sentence, then say Smile. Has anyone else noticed/done this before? Does it have any particular meaning, and what does it originate from? 

[댓글]
I noticed this too and I’m curious to know myself. While I am HOH, I’ve never learned this and always wondered why this was done in the community. I’m genuinely curious to know.

You're thinking about this like the people writing are speakers of a spoken language.

That's not a criticism. It's a good question but you should be able to get the right answer if you change the perspective you're approaching from. Is there something hearing people do that's similar in written communication?

Leftover language from the old TTY days!! We didn’t have emojis back then! We are also visual people, so typing out smile just like we would be smiling if we saw you in person.

1owqbtw,deaf,Learning to be deaf,"I’ve gone profoundly deaf suddenly, literally overnight. Without getting into boring details, the ENT has been great and they identified the medical cause, but it isn’t reversible. I have been fitted with hearing aids that do help, but I still can’t really make out speech that well and I think I’m missing a lot of sounds still. I’m deaf. 

How do I learn how to do this? I feel like I’m not myself anymore. I have a 14 month old and I feel like I’m not the same parent I was the day before I went deaf. How do I figure out how to be myself and deaf at the same time?

I don’t mean to offend anyone, or imply that all you are is deaf. Please understand that it’s not a great experience to just lose everything you’ve known overnight, even if I definitely understand that deaf people lead wonderful and productive lives.

Edit: Just wanted to take a second and say thank you to everyone who has replied, it’s all been really helpful. It’s been really encouraging to hear from people who experienced the same or similar. The ENT keeps telling me how rare it is to lose both ears at once and it just makes me feel more alone!! I think you’re right that I need to focus on being able to communicate with my daughter first of all and start figuring out the fixes for the rest of it as they come. Since reading these replies I’ve been able to find a caption phone app that works in my country and to be honest it made me cry, I was able to call my daughter’s nursery and for the first time I felt like I might be able to do this.

Thanks again to those who took the time to reply. You’ve all helped more than you’ll know.

Definitely learn Sign. Given your child is 14-months, I’m going to take a punt and say there’s still time to form / develop their communication skills. Also, seek out you local D / deaf community - I’m sure there’ll be parents there, that you can learn and seek advice from. Good luck!!

Hey there! My name's Mary and its great to ""meet"" you, since our stories are super similar! I am 52 years old and five years ago this month, I woke up one day completely, 100%, profoundly deaf. I had normal hearing for my entire life, until five years ago. At the time, my son was 15 years old, so I didn't have to go through the toddler/young stages with him with a deaf mom, but did so, as he was a teenager (he's now 20). 

As far as your question of ""how"" to do this, honestly, it's just a day-by-day experience of learning. You'll  have some rough days, but as time goes on and you get  more accustomed to being a deaf person, you'll have better days in there, too. I no longer wear hearing aids because I was wearing ultra power aids, and honestly, can't understand much with them anyway, and still can't hear many sounds, like any sirens, high decibel sounds, etc. so to me at this point, it's just more frustrating to wear them AND still not understand or hear what's really going on anyway. 

Start learning basic sign language, and you can teach your baby the signs, too, with daily repeating of them, for constant practice. Start with words your child would need to communicate most with you -- drink, food, play, toy, things like that. Make sure you learn from a deaf teacher -- this is super important. You want to replicate a deaf (native) ASL user's actions, not that of a hearing person who learned ASL. 

Focus on your most frustrating area (but trust me, I get it's all frustrating at once), and figure out solutions for that area, first. Afraid you won't hear an alarm? Find products online that are flashing sensors for it. Think you won't wake up on time? Go to amazon and get a vibrating alarm clock for under the pillow. Things like that. 

As far as ""you're not the same person,"" trust me, I get it. I've said millions (probably more than that) of times in the past five years, ""I honestly wish I would have been born deaf, because now this would all be the only thing I'd ever known."" You are the same person, but you're not. I get it. Just remember, when it feels rough, please know that there WILL be good days in there, too, where it all feels manageable and it feels ""ok."" 

I wish you the best. You ""are"" me, just with a younger child, five years ago.

Hi friend. I'm sorry you're going through this. Ive started losing my hearing due to menieres disease. I panicked a little at the beginning but it's actually  been a blessing in disguise for me. I'm an ASL interpreter now.

I've got a Google doc I put together. It'll get you started in ASL. Naturally a class with a Deaf instructor will get you farther faster, but this is a great starting line because it's all resources from native signers. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nIl25bnKeQl0OXkMZoq9PkW-vC6VFAqlMgBVK4-EsxM/edit?usp=sharing

Welcome to the community, I know it's been traumatic but we're glad you're here and I hope you'll join our culture.

Major props to you for taking this in great strides! It takes a lot to be willing to recognize this is going to be a huge change. 

First things first, safety. Use your other senses to communicate. Lights and vibrations are the best way. We flicker lights to get someone’s attention. Stomp the ground or tap on the table to get attention. Turn on the light flash alert on your phone for messages or emergency notifications. I use my smart phone with flashing light on the back of the phone for my alarm. Some people have vibrating bed alarm. Some people prefer their bedroom lamp to flash.

Contact Red Cross and your local fire department. Let them know you’re deaf and ask for flashing fire alarms. Some regions have them ready for the fire department to install. Some regions have special grants to help buy some. 

For phone calls, I hear great things about nagish. It’s an app that captions your calls and you can respond either by voice or text. It’s 100% free!! 

It’s a whole different lifestyle but we have our ways to remain fully independent functioning parents, workers, friends, etc. we’re here for you! Let me know if you’ve got any specific questions

It can be very jarring to lose your hearing suddenly, it takes time to adjust and adapt.


In the longer term, if you're a candidate for a CI or something you can consider that. You'll still be deaf, a CI isn't a cure, but I can tell you first hand it's very useful when navigating the hearing world. I'm late deafened, like you except that my hearing was lost over the span of several years.


Before you go after a CI though I highly recommend you become comfortable in your own skin as a deaf person. This takes some effort, if you can find some peer support, that can be very helpful. In the USA there's ALDA, and HLAA, two organizations that will vary greatly by region but may have some great resources for adapting. 


Absolutely learn the sign language of your country or region. You don't have to be completely fluent before you start to reap the benefit. Learn it as a family, your child will pick it up very easily.


If you have other questions just ask.

I went through this too.  Reach put to your govt for services for the deaf.  I got access to free therapy from a therapist specializing in helping new deaf people adjust.  Priceless!!!

What country do you live in? A lot of resources vary by country and I don't want to start suggesting things that are useless to you.",2025-11-14 07:41:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1owqbtw/learning_to_be_deaf/

1owg0mc,deaf,How do deaf people meet their partners?,"I’m really curious about how deaf people meet their partners. How did you meet yours? I’m 25 and profoundly deaf in both ears, and I wear a cochlear implant on my right side. I’ve never been in a relationship before, so the whole idea is new to me. 

[댓글]
College. Here in the States, schools that have strong programs for the Deaf (Gallaudet, NTID, CSUN, etc.) have enough numbers of students of a similar age to make friends, network, and find partners.

I do know others who don't go to college go to social events where large numbers of deaf people gather, and meet people that way. State or national associations, trade fairs, etc., are also another place.

Eh I never really planned to search for a new partner. Someone found me handsome online through Telegram, Deaf Furry group chat, but I turned them down because we weren't a good fit. Then, a second time, a different person wanted me to be their boyfriend, but I said no because he didn't live in the USA.

Later, I went to a rave and someone started chatting with me because he was curious to ask me. 

He hearing and didn't know ASL (I'm a deaf man who uses ASL often), but we still enjoyed talking. We connected well, and now he's been my partner for 7-8 months.

I think you should go out to local events in your community. If you want a deaf partner, go to deaf events. If you don't care whether a partner is deaf or hearing, just go to any event, as it makes it easier to find a good match and start talking. Whether you like the idea or not is up to you, but it's a good way to meet people. I love my partner because his personality is very mature.

are you specifically looking for a Deaf partner?

I met my partner through a VR video game where we could do ASL. We became good friends and the opportunity came up so we decided to meet up so he could practice ASL and we could just hangout. Once we met though feelings developed and the relationship went from there.

I’m HOH but met mine on tinder actually. We figured out the communication in a fun cute way and we currently have lived together 4ish years and been together 10-11. I’ll propose when i have a bit better financial stability. It’s the overthinking things that’ll get you caught up finding someone. Cause they’re that someone they’ll work it out with you. I’m 37 so I think met her around your age, maybe a little older.

i'm not deaf, but i *am* hoh and rely on my ha's, lipreading (heavily), and sign (when available). i met my partner back in a mainstream hs, and we've been friends for the better part of a decade, partners for a year. 

he's a voice and a face i know well, so we don't have major issues communicating. it also helps that he knows my communication needs bc of how long we've known one another. we've also gotten to the point that we don't??? really use words or anything for half of what we say, so that's a thing lmao.

I met my wife on the Internet, right before OKCupid was bought by Match.com 


It's my understanding that matchmaking apps went downhill for a while after that, but since then have made something of a comeback, so there's more than just tinder and the like. I couldn't tell you which ones are any good though.


I didn't have great luck with the ladies until I turned 25, the change in the 25+ range is so drastic my top dating advice is to not date anyone under 25. So keep a positive outlook. I didn't meet my wife until I was 30.


Other than that, no matter your gender or preferences, define what you want in a mate, and go see if you can find it. Adjust your criteria as you learn more about yourself along the way. 


Good luck!

It’s so hard because you’re totally isolated. And I think it was dating apps are all creepy anyway I have a horrible time because I never seen any people.

I just wanna meet a friend and then see what happens from there. I just need me to meet somebody too.

Hinge 😜

I’m profoundly deaf in both ears too and wear a cochlear implant on my left side. I met my current boyfriend of 4 years through Bumble. I didn’t tell him I was deaf when we first met up and told him the second time we met. He was chill about it and thought it was interesting lol

My SO and I actually met at work. I was already looking for a new job because I was starting to dislike my employer so the typical “you should never date a coworker” advice didn’t apply.

Anywhere !!!!  My ex wife is hearing and we meet at work

I haven't met a Deaf or Hoh partner yet, my last two partners were hearing, and the first passed away after we divorced due to his health going downhill, (died in car crash), and the other just left. I finally got a divorce from him this year and went back to my maiden name. 

If I do date, I have no clue how in the heck I'll meet someone since I can't get to most Deaf events, and so I'm on Facebook dating. If someone comes along then cool, but not gonna try and get all bound up looking for a partner. 

I met both hearing partners on Ok Cupid.

Met mine at a hospital lol

Met mine thru instagram

I met my boyfriend in wattpad. I writed a lot, he always commented, we were like 14-15 so it's kind of  expected at that age. Now we both 21 and everything has been nice, we want to get married in the next years

I did it the old-fashioned way, we met in high school. In two weeks, it'll be our 39th anniversary. 

He's hearing, I'm deaf/HoH, but was mainstreamed throughout school. Since joining this sub, I've asked him if my hearing (or lack thereof) was a plus or a minus in him wanting to date me. He said it wasn't, he never really thought about it. I'm also an extrovert and he pretty much had no choice in becoming my friend (he was the new kid in my auto shop class and I was one of three girls in that class). 

Sorry that my story isn't really useful at this point.

I'm Polyamorous and transgender. I met my fiance at a group for transgender activists. Although I can pass as hearing fairly well, I do prefer to sign especially in public places as it just takes way less energy than trying to hear and lip-read. I disclose this to people when we become close. My now-fiance immediately started learning ASL and is now clunkily conversational. My girlfriend I met online in a group for writers. She happened to already know a large amount of ASL because of a Deaf cousin.

1owbtlk,deaf,Woolworths Using AI interviews,"I applied for a nightfill job at Woolworths supermarket on online. But when I completed my form, it took me to the AI interview process where you would text with AI.

After that, it then asked me to do a video interview which obviously required the microphone. But I was unable to do that since I was Deaf, which left me frustrated because apparently the Woolworths website said that the AI process would mean that everyone would have equal opportunities at applying.

I guess my alternative choice would be to walk in and ask the staff.

My opinion is that the AI process should completely be scrapped as it is no good use, and the job applications should be done as soon as you confirm your information.

1owb386,deaf,Congenital SSD &amp; Cochlear Implants,"Hi everyone! I hope I used the right flair for this.
I’m a parent looking for some advice and personal experiences. I have an 8 month old who was born with profound hearing loss in her right ear. 

We just had an MRI, and her doctor said she’s a candidate for a cochlear implant.

They’ve told us the best time for surgery is around one year old, which is coming up so fast. My husband and I are both really nervous about her having a major surgery when she’s still so little. 

If you (or your child) has single-sided deafness and got a cochlear implant, I’d love to hear about your experience. How old were you when you got it? What was the adjustment period like after? How do you feel about it now? What do you wish you would have known beforehand? 

I appreciate any responses. We just want to make the best decision for our little girl.

I have SSD and am surprised to see all the young kids in this generation being encouraged to have CI surgery. I have had some hiccups but most people don’t even know I have SSD.

I am newly SSD in my late 30s and am learning ASL. Having access to language and Deaf culture will be really beneficial to me since I can't hear speech in environments with any background noise. CI will require multiple surgeries over time and additional therapies, without having full hearing. Check out Deaf-led organizations for input because the medical model is fiscally motivated and has a ""fixing"" mindset. Deaf Culture celebrates Deaf Gain vs. hearing loss. I wish you and your family well on this journey! 

Here's a resource to start: [https://www.leadkfamilyservices.org/my-child-is-deaf/](https://www.leadkfamilyservices.org/my-child-is-deaf/)

I have SSD In my right ear (31yo), It will have a profound impact on their life If nothing Is done about it.

I can't speak on CI but I know it's not perfect or a fix. 

Even with CI your child can potentially be welcome in the Deaf community and that is such a gift! My only real feedback is to get evolved in early intervention and learning sign language no matter CI or no CI. 

Is there a local Deaf school? Could you contact them and ask about 0-3 program? Many incorporate speech and sign together for best language development for children who have some hearing! Either way they may know of local resources or have more experience.

*Edit: I grew up HoH but was able to struggle through without access to sign language or the Deaf community. My parents 100 percent thought they were doing what was right but now my hearing is worse so it is even more difficult to connect with hearing people and I am scrambling to catch up with my ASL in my 30s. I wish I would have learned ASL and had access from the start!!!

I have SSD in my right ear but I’ve found I’m able to adjust for it fairly well and I decided against a CI for myself because of that, but I’m open to revisiting that decision in the future.

I don’t know what I would choose for a child.",2025-11-13 19:52:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1owb386/congenital_ssd_cochlear_implants/

I would call roadside if you have one, they would be able to help. Just be careful when googling tow companies as there are fake ones who will charge you a lot of money and having you wait for hours just for no one to show up. Also if you are asking how to actually contact one and you use VRS, there apps you can add to your smartphone so you can use VRS on the go. Hope this helps as I don’t really know if you are located in the united state.

Do you have AAA?

If you are in danger on a busy road, call 911/999/local emergency responders. 

In the US, use VRS or IP relay for the call. Most roadside assistance companies operate through local contractors. Make sure they know you’re deaf and to be patient on the call. That info should be passed on to the tow truck driver.

1ow8ezb,deaf,What makes you not want to wear your hearing aids,"This year, I've started going put without aids in. And I like it? My anxiety calms down so much when I don't wear them. And I tgink it's because my brain is no longer trying frantically to make sense of all the auditory input, to recognize the sounds. Without aids in, my world is 100% silent and I'm much calmer and less stressed. 
To give an example, I live in a building. I've realized when there are more than one person in the elevator, someone will ask which floor. So I get stressed wondering if they asked yet because i couldn't see their faces. I don't know if they think I'm being rude. Should I just go ahead and say 11th floor please? Or would they think I'm being bossy? Should i instead just press my floor? Would they think i font like them? That's how my mind works when I wear aids.
Without hearing aids, what will be will be. Did people speak? Didn't hear anything :) I just say excuse me and press my floor. Did people look at each other? Maybe. Not my problem. I just smile.
It's ironic.

[댓글]
Just getting tired of hearing things in general and having to focus on what I'm hearing and what people are saying. I just decide to give myself hearing breaks. Also when my family won't sign with me so I take them out forcing them to use the signs they know hehe

I live in NYC, it’s always loud. The subway will temporarily affect my hearing if i have my hearing aid in. Walking down the street to the train to run errands I probably won’t even put my hearing aid in till I’m about to walk into a store cause I don’t have plans of speaking to anyone on the way to the store. Being around my place I don’t typically wear it until it’s night time considering the big city I’d prefer to be a bit more cognizant in the streets at night. I don’t personally feel I need to accommodate myself for strangers.

How *noisy* the world is. Holy fuck. It’s so tiring. How do people live like this? I’m exhausted after a few hours of being outside because I have to work *so hard* to filter out all the background noise and hear what I need to hear. After especially noisy outings (malls, casinos, etc.), I sleep good that night because I’m so tired.

I always have mine on when i leave the house, like i wear them, but they are turned off about 95% of the time! i am very deaf so how loud they have to be i just cant handle it

Everyone have own prefer , me more of wjat my moods are?? Someday i do and dont wear hearing aids

I’m 42 and have had hearing aids since I was 8 months old. For the last 10 years I have stopped wearing them on a regular basis, I only wear them now when I know I will be interacting with people. I don’t wear them in the house etc. 

Like you I find the world so much more calmer without them but I also suspect that I am autistic so that could play a part of it too.

I'm just used to it, only time I take them out is when I'm going to sleep, taking a shower/in water or if I'm hungover lol. Phonak app says I have an average uptime of 14 hours a day.

Depression…  Overstimulation… &amp; exhaustion after a long period of wearing them (eventually my brain just turns to soup, I can’t focus anymore, it stops making sense of words, &amp; things just sound like noise).  I went yeeeeears without wearing them, &amp; I was always horrible about wearing them consistently ever since I was little—my audiologists would always scold me, &amp; crank the volumes, telling me that I had to wear them loudly, but I would always keep them lower after, because I didn’t like the loudness back then.  Now, as I have a profound loss (it slowly progressed growing up), I have three modes in life (😂):  

1).  All the way up (5/5 volumes), &amp; love the physical sensation of feeling the volumes tickling my eardrums…

2).  “Everyday,” loud (2-3/5 volumes).

3).  No HAs; deaf time, because I want / need to break from hearing &amp; listening, &amp; want to enjoy the long-familiar quietude.  

I am a, “volume junkie,” according to one of my past audis.  Eventually I learned to like the loudness, but when things get distorted, I turn them down to, “clean up the volume.”

I wear a CI which is a glorified hearing aid.  I take it off at home,  and watch tv with captions.   I find all the microwave beeps and fridge motors , the dishwasher,  so annoying.  It's peaceful to have quiet.

I am profoundly deaf and ditched my hearing aids. No struggle, no worrying about not understanding people. It's WAY more comfortable to be without. If someone starts to talk, I just  motion that I'm deaf. I don't use my voice in public because even if I say I'm deaf, people just out of basic human nature, will then still keep talking, ignoring the fact that I just said I'm deaf. So I usually just motion ""deaf"" and go about my day:)

I've never liked wearing hearing aids!, in fact I hate wearing them!, I've never accepted this deafness, mainly because it was caused by a brutal husband's viscous attack, at a time when cops treated these attacks as 'domestic' which meant they were not important enough for cops to attend in 1985, since then my hearing as slowly become worse, today my right ear is profound, my left severe.

I take my devices (ears my family calls them), off at home and on when I am working or out of the house. Though sometimes out of the house too. I get over stimulated easy, and need that hearing break or I'll feel crazy. When off, I rely on captions, lip reading, and body language. I do have a little residual hearing in my left ear it's enough to know someone is talking to me but without my devices they all sound low and muffled. So lip reading a lot and body language.

Lots of things. Radio at work: too many “hits” that annoy me, reverse noises on lorries: too noisy, high pitched sounds: vibrations go through my skull as that’s where my hearing aid is, fireworks, they shock me, buzzing of refrigerator: self explanatory, volume too loud on music and can’t turn it down: why? The shooting school near me. Farm equipment: too noisy. Foxes doing the naughty: I don’t want to listen to them honestly but they are so very noisy. The geese near me. That’s all I can think about right now but I am sure there’s so much more.

I'm in habit since childhood of only wearing mine for family events, work and situations where I need to listen to a public speaker/show. It's less wear and tear on expensive hearing aids, less stimulation since I'm also neurodivergent and keeps me in the habit of speaking up to hearing people to accommodate my needs, which isn't always done when they assume the hearing aid and my clear speaking skills = ""fixed"", it's not. Then again, I also sometimes need them to see the hearing aid to understand I am deaf enough that they'll believe me. Far too many assume we all have the luxury of knowing sign but barely can speak.

Tap class lol

I've stop wearing mine because they became ineffective and I haven't had them recalibrated.",2025-11-13 18:13:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ow8ezb/what_makes_you_not_want_to_wear_your_hearing_aids/

Do they really have a TTY number? Is it current?  I haven't seen a real TTY number in ages. Typically they just tell you to call 711.  TTYs don't really work on VoIP or VoLTE.

1ovy6k8,deaf,Can I call myself d/Deaf?,"This is a question I go back and forth on regularly. I will have a few days where me being deaf doesn’t seem to impact me and then I’m suddenly put in a situation (like a room with background noise or a concert) and I think oh my I am Deaf!!!

The last thing I want to do is take up space that isn’t for me if that makes sense. I often feel more deaf than hearing people and more hearing than deaf people.

Here is my reasoning for both:

Not Deaf
1. I do feel like I have a lot of access to things that other Deaf people don’t, I don’t need a BSL interpreter and possibly never will
2. I can hear verbal communication quite well in a room with zero background noise 
3. I have normal hearing in my right ear 
4. I don’t like wearing my hearing aid, it’s itchy and I’m convinced it hardly makes a difference unless I connect it to my phone and hold it up to someone’s mouth
5. Some random sounds that are really quiet or hard for other deaf people to hear I seem to have no issue hearing!  Sometimes I can hear people in next room or crushing of leaves etc. 

Deaf
1. I can’t hear concerts anymore! Like I hear the actual noises but I can’t make out what the singers are saying so I have to google the lyrics and learn them beforehand 
2. I get anxious when walking into a room with background noise in a way others do not
3. Even when at home alone with my girlfriend with no background noise, I do mishear her a lot
4. My sister is Deaf, my parents both need hearing aids and my mum was born with quite significant hearing loss. AKA it was more of a ‘when’ than and ‘if’ for me
5. My friend is suspicious that my hearing is getting worse
6. My eardrum is quite damaged! So is my tube in my ear, it may never go away


EDIT, update/takeaway:

I’m gonna rock with HoH and half deaf for now lol!

+ extra context is that I have APD (probs linked to my autism) which explains why I don’t hear very well in situations others might

In the UK, there's a big difference between being deaf and Deaf. I'm 100% profoundly deaf as I lost my hearing overnight and do not use BSL sign as my primary language, participate within the community and was not raised within the Deaf culture. If I did though, I would be Deaf.

You can identify however you want. It doesn’t take up room like you think it is. If you feel more comfortable with deaf than hearing then you can identify yourself as deaf (or hard of hearing in case you don’t feel comfortable with either of them). You can be even half deaf if you want.

I'm from the UK too.  Most of what you posted is very medically orientated, but the Deaf Culture concept is, broadly speaking, non-medical (with a key exception that I mention below).   
  
Quite honestly, 95% of the fluent deaf signers I chat with, I have no idea of their audiological status or hearing history or what age they became deaf. It just isn't relevant. I broadly keep track of who identifies as hearing, but everyone else just gets a generic label of 'deaf' (ie. not-hearing) in my mind, and even then I will forget sometimes.    
  
A couple of things to consider (copied over from a different post I made to someone else):

\* D/d was invented by a hearing anthropologist in IIRC 1970s. Even then, some Deaf academics were concerned it would lead to division and elitism.  In any case it's become a useful term for labelling a concept of a shared culture and community. But it should never ever be used to put someone down or exclude or make anyone feel bad about themselves.

\* Around 90% of deaf signers are late signers, for historical reasons including language oppression and language deprivation.  Only about 10% of the community are native deaf signers.  Hence why you will rarely see the term 'native signer' as most of us are NOT native signers and only arrived in the Deaf community at varying stages of life. It's a journey.

\* A substantial number of hearing people have signing as their first language, mother language, and preferred language. Under international language frameworks (mostly in Europe), they should also have the right to go to signing schools because it is their first language and a recognised language of their nation.  This concept has not been explored in any great depth.

\* Informally, 'Deaf' may also sometime includes hearing people. For example in a deaf event I might text my friend and say 'everyone here's Deaf' even though I know well some of them are hearing. It's a culture and language term, not a medically defined term. People who sign fluently, and all that comes with signing fluently.

\* However, the actual lived experience of oppression due to being medically deaf is also an important part of Deaf identity. (But it's not the only part.)  Recognising that experience, sharing it with others, becoming stronger through that sharing, is an important part of Deaf culture / identity and perhaps is one of the key stages that HoH / late deafened have not gone through compared to a HoH / late deafened who signs fluently.

Eh…. All due respect… I’d say your “Not Deaf” #3 kinda contradicts a lot of what you put under Deaf right?

I apologize if I’m confused.

I would say there are groups of people with a shared experience of having hearing loss in one ear.  However I would say that is a very different experience than what Deaf people experience.

You mention you don’t “need” a BSL interpreter but do you sign?

Deaf culture is about a lot more than whether or not you can hear. 🤟🏽☺️

I understand the confusion between which you would fall under. Personally, I struggled to understand whether I should use deaf or HoH ( my default is to now use HoH, especially since my hearing appears to have stabilised ); as such, I would classify you as deaf rather than Deaf. You say 

&gt;I do feel like I have a lot of access to things that other Deaf people don’t, I don’t need a BSL interpreter and possibly never will

&gt;I can hear verbal communication quite well in a room with zero background noise

&gt;I have normal hearing in my right ear

Contrary to belief ( Signers, feel free to correct me ), you do not need to be diagnosed with profound loss to exclusively employ Sign - however given your first 3 points, this answer seems quite straightforward( ? ) - however:

&gt;My sister is Deaf, my parents both need hearing aids and my mum was born with quite significant hearing loss. AKA it was more of a ‘when’ than and ‘if’ for me

As you mention above, your sister and parents also have hearing loss - your mother's is / was quite significant - which ***could*** place you in the Deaf category...? I think it is important to understand the difference: the use of the capital D refers to and indicates strong cultural &amp; social identifying factors and use of language ( like ASL **or** BSL ). There seems to be quite a strong emphasis on language - i.e someone who is Deaf is likely to employ Sign as their first language. Whereas, the use of the lower case appears to signify / relate to a medical or physical perspective. 

Use whichever you feel most comfortable with - but I do hope the difference between the two uses is clearer for you...?

Deaf isn’t can’t hear anything at all ever
I was born deaf but I don’t sign and now but now have some hearing

I don’t think most people care what you call yourself.

You can be deaf without being a part of Deaf culture.  I know that people in the culture can speak better to that than I can.

For a lot of folks with hearing loss, it’s a matter of being able to communicate accurately to others how much they can hear or what accommodations they need.

I have a moderate hereditary sensorineural hearing loss.  I generally refer to myself as hard of hearing, but in some situations, saying I’m hearing impaired gets the point across better and encourages the other person to speak louder for some reason.  

That being said, many people who are deaf also refer to themselves as hearing impaired.

Outside of whether you’re part of the culture, it becomes a matter of semantics and what you’re trying to convey.

Hard of hearing maybe?

I wouldn’t say Deaf no but still HoH for sure or even little d

![gif](giphy|yBzRyo9EycRFseOw8Y)

You pass. Here’s your Deaf Card.

I identify based on who I'm talking to and where I am. 

I identify as deaf mainly, but not Deaf (the flairs here don't have a difference 😕) because even though I am loosely involved in the Deaf community in my area and know ASL a bit, I'm nowhere near fluent. 

When I'm talking to hearing people I can't talk to with a transcript (as I need a transcript going to understand pretty much any speech) I'll pretend to be fully Deaf and write back and forth. Have had great success with this at hair appointments (can't wear glasses there so no transcript).

When I'm talking to hearing people I can use a transcript with I'll say I'm hard of hearing. Especially if I'm talking to someone I work with. I verbally speak to them a lot and that seems to be the line hearing people draw- they assume if you can speak you can hear. Which gets me a LOT of weird looks when I use my transcript. Not a fan of that. 

And then in places like this i'll call myself deaf as I think it's more generally accurate- I can understand next to no speech except in absolutely perfect conditions; all of my functional hearing resides in the ""noises"" category. Like yay I can hear the cars on the road but I sure as hell can't understand speech. 

So I base it more on the effects on other people in order to make their understanding easier, essentially.

Deaf with a capital D means you grew up culturally deaf. Did you?

I'm not qualified to tell you if you're culturally Deaf.

As far as symptoms go, it sounds like HoH with APD to me. Can you ask your audiologist?",2025-11-13 11:00:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ovy6k8/can_i_call_myself_ddeaf/
1ovwlgr,deaf,I need y'all to remind me that patience is a virtue,"For context: I lost a massive chunk of my hearing in an accident in 2017, and was given hearing aids to help me (CI are not an option for my type of hearing loss). I went through a few pairs, and now I am going without due to finances. I'm currently saving up for a good pair from Costco, but that's not really the point here. I currently base all my conversations off of body language, context, lip reading, and doing a damn good job of mad-libbsing a conversation. Its not easy, but I've gotten good at it because it's my only choice. No one in my life speaks sign language, so I've somewhat practiced it, but haven't felt much motivation since I mostly practice by myself.

My partner and I have been together for two years. Before he met me, he didn't have anyone in his life who was deaf. He mumbles quite a bit, which is normal for this part of the country, but can talk quite clearly when he makes an effort to. The problem is, I can manage my conversations so well, that, even though I can't hear what someone is saying, I can keep up enough to give vague answers that fit the conversation. So I think he *forgets* that he has to talk clearly. Usually I don't make people repeat themselves because, jeez, we would be having a 5 minute conversation over the course of 20 minutes; that's not realistic. So I just kinda...deal with it? I completely understand where he's coming from, it's hard to change the way you talk if you're not consciously focusing on it for every sentence, and if you spoke the same way for several decades, yk, that's how you talk; that's your voice. And his voice is mumbly when he's tired or at other times, and that's okay. But my hearing loss is progressive and his mumbly voice will eventually be too hard for me to keep up with. That scares me.

Sometimes it adds up. Sometimes I really notice how much I'm actually missing and how many conversations I'm in without actually being a part of. And it hurts. It hurts more with him because, even though he can't relate, Ive mentioned before about being lonely from how my hearing loss makes me feel. Maybe he didn't hear me? Haha. Ha.

The closest area with deaf events that I've found is about a half hour away. I've met one deaf person in my area and we exchanged numbers, but that friendship never got very deep and eventually fizzled out. How do y'all stay patient when people don't make a consistent effort to communicate in a way you can understand? In public, at work or stores or wherever, it's easy to let it roll off my back. But, if someone cares, they make an effort to show that, right? So how do you keep these situations from blocking out all the things people *do* do to show they care? Bc he does, this isn't about that. But sometimes, like tonight, it *feels* like he doesn't.

I hope my wording makes sense. Thanks for letting me scream into the void.

After 50+ years of deafness, I no longer associate with anyone who doesn't try. I'm the hardest working listener in any room I enter. I utilize every skill I have to make sense of what people say. Just like you have. The least they can do is meet me halfway. Starting with enunciation. If they can't put in even just a little effort, then they dont care. I tend to believe them instead of making excuses for them.

Why don’t you look into sign language lessons in your local area, for both you and husband? That way no matter what happens, you two will have a way to communicate. Depending on what country you’re in, you might be able to do them very cheaply online or in person. It would be like a fun hobby to do together.

Sweetness, My grandkids, who were 2 and 3 by the time I finally met them in person, learned in less than 4 months to stop mumbling and look at me when they talk. They will even come up to me and turn my head towards them if they have something they really want me to focus on.   Even my ex who was a total horses behind learned to look at me and he was horribly abusive.  This guy just does not seem to care about your needs. He wants you to just deal with it and that is totally not cool.  He really should care more and by this point be looking at you when he speaks to you and speaking clearly.  What he is doing is not ok.  

  
Just a side note. Look into the Lion's Club in your area. If finances are a barrier to getting you hearing aids, they have in may places hearing aid banks.  They are not brand new HS but they are usually pretty good ones and this might get you what you need.

There are phone apps you can use so you don't have to rely on your exhausted brain to do all the work.  What are you doing to your hearing aids that you go through a pair so quickly? Wow!

Sorry to ask how come CI won't be available for your kind of hearing loss when you can wear a hearing aid? If you can hear through hearing aid the cochlear implant would qualify as long as your cochlear nerve to the brain is damaged.

I'm a cochlear implant user and used to wear a hearing aid.

Regarding your partner, it's take people awhile to adapt to the situation. I think it's better to let him know that he needs to speak clear and y have to repeat until he gets it. Unfortunately, it's a habit that will take time to break - he can also be tired too.

[댓글]
Not that it’s your job to go down to meet her at her level, but can you figure out why she’s so upset? Does she feel like she “failed” as a mom because you have hearing loss? Because she is losing her path to communicate with you as she doesn’t sign? Or is she literally just being an ignorant ass? If it’s the latter I can’t help you, but the former two (and many other reasons) have paths forward.

In the meantime… disengaging when possible, keeping interaction to a minimum, and making sure you’re feeling loved by others in your life.

I had an extremely tenuous relationship with my mother when I was living in the same house as her. It improved drastically with a few years time, her getting therapy, and us not living together. 

As for losing hearing fully, that’s a journey you’ll have to go on if it comes. But you’re not alone in being late deafened, learning asl later in life, or feeling stuck between deaf/hard of hearing/hearing communities. 

You’ll figure this out, but I’m sorry you’re in a situation where you have to deal with your mother’s negative reactions on top of your own journey of grappling with disability/body grief.

You are worthy and loved by many for exactly who you are! You have a welcome spot in the Deaf community, too.

Kudos to everyone offering help. Sorry but that's not going to be me because I'm filled with absolute rage based on her doing the whole ""deaf"" accent stuff that it's completely rattled me! She sounds like a real piece of shit. I've been deaf for over 20 years so I've encountered plenty of assholes, pricks and just garbage humans and it takes A LOT to grind my gears but this has me screaming on the inside

I hope you get away from her ASAP and I hope you have enoug self respect to never accept her hollow ass apologies. It takes a certain kind of person to behave the way she does and there's nothing to justify that type of behavior. Ugh

\&gt; i'm terrified of losing my hearing fully

It's not so bad, when I was your age I had lost 100% of my left ear and my other ear was slowly getting worse and worse.  (it takes time, you'll be OK, in the short term it's not fun, but you're not alone) 

\&gt;  i miss hearing the rain outside my bedroom window 

I can relate, thunderstorms and other sounds were the ones I missed the most, but in time you'll miss them less. 

OK, so we can't get inside your mom's head, but it seems like she's acting out of fear and ignorance. Her ignorance isn't getting any better because she's also afraid to confront reality.  The fact that your mom would mock you like she did, makes me think she's might just be a cunt.  Getting people to show their true colors more quickly is part of the deaf experience.  (It's not unique to deafness, it's just that when you're an ""other"" people give less of a shit what you think of them). 

Do you still live with your mom?  If so, you're probably itching to move out on your own, but I get that it might not be financially do-able at the moment. If you can't move out any time soon, consider other ways to add some distance. 

Hearing people don't understand, but I'm sure you've noticed. We need to remind ourselves that people forget, and they don't understand. I'm not in any way that you should ever apologize for not being able to hear. Just have patience and kindness when you have to remind your mom that you're going deaf for the 15th time. I once had to explain to my own mom that there's no such thing as ""loud enough"" Also remember if you're frustrated, the other person is frustrated, whether they're showing it or not. Your mom probably doesn't consider it's frustrating for you too. 

In general, you may be a candidate for a CI in the future, depending on your specific pathology.  I'm probably your mom's age or older and I only got implanted about 50 weeks ago. Whatever you do just be sure you do it because you want it, not because you're sick of your mom. Also the best advice I can give is to be comfortable in your own skin as a deaf person, a CI isn't a cure but it's quite useful for navigating the hearing world. 

Please post again if you have other questions!

You may want to suggest that your mother explore options such as texting you, learning ASL, or hiring a personal ASL interpreter.

1ovpii8,deaf,Deaf culture for late Deaf folks?,"Hi friends! Please bear with me for this post. 

I recently saw a post titled “Why all of the hate?”. Essentially, this person had become HoH within the past few months. They went to a Deaf event (not sure if it was open to beginner signers or any of the specifics) still with a very audist view of their hearing loss (totally get it, going from hearing to HoH is a change and can come with grief). My understanding was that they were upset that they were not automatically accepted into Deaf culture. They were very focused on hearing loss being the only factor that should matter, and there is no difference between late deaf folks and culturally Deaf folks. 

I read through the responses they got, and it left me with some thoughts and questions. Now, this person was very disrespectful and had zero respect for the (very Deaf blunt) responses they received. 

I am Late Deaf myself, and at least consider myself a part of the community and celebrate this part of my identity. 4 years ago, I absolutely grieved. It is a big adjustment! When you are used to receiving so much information through your ears, losing that can be tough at first. 

Anyways, safe to say I have adjusted. I used ASL as my primary mode of communication, work in a Deaf school, greatly prefer the company of other Deaf folks, etc. I did struggle for a while with not having full access to language (couldnt understand spoken english, didnt know sign), so i can RELATE a bit to the experience of being without language. 

All of that said, my experiences greatly differ from born Deaf folks. While i can relate to access issues as an adult, I was never a Deaf kiddo. I grew up with a natural access to language. Even before knowing ASL, I had full access to written language in my first language i had been using since birth. Learning ASL as a second language as an adult is very tough, but not the same by any means. I never was left out of conversations with my family as a child. I never had difficulties accessing education until now (higher education). Employers do not know I am Deaf until I tell them as I have no accent. 

There are MANY struggles as a Deaf person we can all relate to, but it is naive to disregard the privileges i do have a late Deaf person. 

I guess my question is, is there a place for late Deaf people in Deaf culture? Of course I know I am welcome in the Deaf community. When i lost my hearing, i went to Deaf socials open to ASL beginners. I was respectful as i understood i was a newcomer. Yes, i had hearing loss, but the community and culture had been there far before that. Deaf people fight to maintain Deaf culture and community so that i was lucky enough to join. 

Overall, I am just curious on if late Deaf folks are ever considered culturally Deaf, or if it really is exclusive to born Deaf peeps. The responses to the original post were unclear to me, but again, that poster was incredibly disrespectful.

1ovp20p,deaf,How can I connect with the deaf community?,"I was born deaf, but got surgery when I was 5 (I don't remember what it's called. Something about a tube being put in to help drain my ear?). I am 24 now and just hard of hearing. I was told my hearing is about 70% when in silence but drops to 50% in loud areas. I also lost all memory of being deaf. I used to hate my brain for forgetting. Especially since I can't remember waking up after surgery and hearing for the first time. I only recently realized the reason I forgot was because it was traumatic. 

Realizing this was a big moment for me. I know I'll go deaf again due to age. I'm in my mid 20s and have hearing of a mid 40 yr. I was so scared for so long to go deaf again but I didn't know why. Well part of it was the idea of being more isolated. But I've finally let go of that fear now.

I am the only person in my family to have hearing problems. Soooo obviously I was told how lucky I was for surgery. My mom told me over and over how lucky I was because she didn’t want to learn ASL. Well in spite of that, I've been working on myself and healing and trying to connect to communities. I am a part of several other communities that have helped heal me in some way. I'm so thankfully for it. It's only recently I've started to heal from this trauma around my deafness. I want to connect with this community. I plan on taking ASL classes when I can afford them. What else should I do? Where is the best place to learn more? What would be a good way to connect? 

Sorry if this is too long. I felt it would help if I explained why I wanted to connect with this communtiy. I've been nervous to reach out for a long time

1ov3wzg,deaf,Hearing impaired and social relationships,"Hello everyone,

I'm looking for advice on how to better manage social relationships in noisy environments.

I have about 60% hearing loss, with hearing aids fortunately. But as soon as there is noise around (in class, on transport, bars, cafes, parties, or simply when several people are talking at the same time), I hear almost nothing.

It’s very frustrating to want to interact, to participate in a conversation, but not to be able to.

Being basically rather extroverted when I was younger, having to “change my personality” because of that is difficult.

I can only have a normal discussion face-to-face, with one person, in a quiet environment.

The only positive point that I see is that this hearing loss has also become my greatest source of motivation for my entrepreneurial project. But on a social level, I still haven’t found the “code” to easily integrate into groups.

Those of you who are hard of hearing or have more experience, how do you manage this?

Thank you in advance for your advice :)",2025-11-12 12:33:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ov3wzg/hearing_impaired_and_social_relationships/

Get support from every adult you can.  Your mom, teachers, school counselors, etc.  Anyone who can put pressure on your father to change his mind.

Why doesn't he want you to have them?

Talk to your mom again and tell her you really need her help to talk with your dad. 

You could ask your ENT doctor to explain directly to your dad why hearing aids are important. 

They can make it clear it’s not optional, it’s about keeping your hearing from getting worse and helping you do well in school.

If your parents still refuse, tell a trusted teacher or school counselor what’s happening. They can support you and may help talk to your parents too. You shouldn’t have to struggle just because someone won’t listen.

1oufk7k,deaf,"Teenager with possible hearing loss, should I see a pediatric or general audiologist?","Title says it all. I'm 16, my school recently administered hearing and vision screenings. My family received a letter that I failed a portion of the hearing test. It wasn't much of a shock to me, since I've been failing them since I was a baby, and doctors have always attributed the outcome to external factors.

The school recently had us sign off that we will speak to a medical professional. I switched out of pediatric care around a year ago, however, we have concerns that an audiologist who mainly deals with adults would disregard possible issues, since teenagers don't typically experience hearing loss. I guess I wanted to hear from people who have gone through this sort of thing, if my fears are actually rational?

[댓글]
Do you know the pathology of your hearing loss?  What kind of ""external factors"" ? 

\&gt; we have concerns that an audiologist who mainly deals with adults would disregard possible issues, since teenagers don't typically experience hearing loss.

No, that's not how that works.  The younger you experience hearing loss the more important it is to determine your specific pathology because hearing loss in young people isn't typical. You may get a referral to someone who typically sees younger people but just brushing you off would be very unprofessional.  

Go see a real audiologist, one through a medical organization or hospital system, not a person that needs to sell hearing aids to keep the lights on. (OR get a referral and go from there).  You may be referred to an ENT specialist (otolaryngologist).

As another commenter said, you need to see a ENT and audiologist. Forget seeing a pediatrician. For this, you need actual experts that can pin down where your loss is originating from. 

Hearing loss is possible at all ages, and ENTs and audiologists have tons of experience with all types of people.

Ent and audiologist

Certainly try to speak to a paediatric audiologist in the first instance. They will generally see more severe/profound cases arising from genetic/childhood disease causes whereas adult audiology may mostly deal with milder age-related loss. 

Paediatrics will also have a better understanding of what you need at school, college and entering work/adulthood vs adult audiology.

All of which results in Paediatrics generally taking issues more seriously and moving faster. So best to go with them initially and then transition to adult audiology in a couple of years once you're ready.

Agree with others, see an ENT first. They are very accustomed to dealing with children since so many kids have ear infections, tonsil issues, etc. Many ENTs have an audiologist on staff too, so it’s one-stop shopping, which is convenient. I don’t think you need to worry about pediatric vs adult. Also, you’re 16, it’s not like you’re 5. :-) Good luck, and don’t be afraid to get hearing aids if you need them! I have had genetic hearing loss all my life and I finally got HAs at about age 35. Wish I hadn’t waited so long! They really do help.

Consider seeing an ENT first, for any structural issues, then an audiologist

I recommend seeing a pediatric audiologist/ an audiologist that see pediatric patients and adults as they are more familiar with hearing loss in teens than strictly an adult audiologist. I had hearing aids since the second grade and as a teen I would regularly see a pediatric audiologist who would recommend the right hearing aid or assistive technology for my age and would work within the classroom setting as that is what I needed. To me it felt like  they knew what type of hearing aid/ technology I needed based on my age. Now that I am an adult I see an adult audiologist and I feel like I am the youngest patient there. I mostly see older patients, but since I am a still an adult they know what type of assistive technology I need to fit my adult hearing needs as compared to when I was a teenager in high school. From my experience adult audiologist only have hearing aids/ assistive technology geared towards adults. Hope this helps and you’re able to find a solution or reason you can’t pass a hearing screening.

If you can find an ENT in your area who specializes in hearing loss (otologist or neuro-otologist), that would be ideal. If you have access to a pediatric ENT/otologist who specializes in hearing, that would be great too. These doctors typically will have audiologists within their practices, which is convenient. I hope you find the right doctor in your area. Best of luck!!

Your insurance may require you to see a Primary Care Physician in order to get a referral to a specialist/audiologist. Check with your insurance to see what's required.

I started losing my hearing as a teenager, and it wasn’t until I was 22 that I learned it was caused by a genetic disorder that led to benign tumors growing on each auditory nerve.  Not saying your situation is the same, but the point is, you really won’t know until it’s checked out, and it’s something that should be taken seriously.",2025-11-11 17:26:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oufk7k/teenager_with_possible_hearing_loss_should_i_see/

[댓글]
\&gt; Did the worker help you in the rehabilitation department?

They tried, but I found the job on my own.  

\&gt;Was it difficult?

It was frustrating, I've been with my current employer for about 11 years now, so the job market was terrible back then but maybe not as bad as it is currently.  

Don't be afraid of a career change, my current job was a different industry but my computer skills allowed me to excel. I don't need to hear to be good at my job, but that's true for most jobs really.  

I'm in the USA and the job market here is terrible right now, my wife is hearing and until recently had a lot of trouble finding work, despite her master's degree. She too had to shift to a different kind of work than what she's done in the past.  Good luck!

I work in a Deaf school! My hearing loss was actually a perk :)

Honestly it's starting to very much look like getting a job isn't so much about ""what you know"" and more like ""who you know"". Try asking friends of friends, parents of friends, etc.

I worked hard on becoming well-educated. Applied to jobs that I was overqualified for. Applied to many jobs (usually around 100 jobs each time I was looking). Told friends I was looking for work. Volunteered in different places. Got training and mentoring on how to have good interviews.

I have a Master's Degree so this might change the view a bit but the key to finding a job is targeted applications, a tailored resume, and using tools like LinkedIn to reach out to recruiters/hiring managers. 

I'm HoH and need hearing aids to function but still have a really hard time hearing in groups or offices so I've tried to find jobs that are at least partially remote because I can stream meetings to my HAs and that makes things a million times easier. That said, you're gonna need a few things to find jobs.

1. Some education. It doesn't matter if it's just primary school, college, advanced degrees, etc. but competition today is very high as global markets are down so every bit of education you can have will help. With that in mind, if you only completed high school, don't apply to jobs that require a PhD
2. A good resume. This doesn't mean a list of thins you were responsible for. It means bullet points that are easy to read that show what you did, the outcome, and the impact of it. Always try to have a NUMBER with the bullet point. Meaning, if you stocked shelves at a grocery store then you want to focus on how efficient you were by reducing the average time spent by X% or something along those lines. If you have a more corporate style job, tie everything back to a business case and focus on time savings = money or revinue generated, etc. A good rule of thumb is that if you cant quantify the point, it's probably not worth having on a resume
3. A tailored resume and this is the big one. USE CHAT GPT, use tools, use people who have done this before but you want to pull out the key words from the job description and add those into your resume. You want your bullets to be geared towards the job you are applying for. No HR person has the time to ""see your potential"" or understand that your skills transfer. They spend like 30 seconds looking at your resume and if it doesn't scream that you're the exact match for their job description, they're going to move on. Make sure you have a master resume (I like to bold or highlight my keywords) and just drop in the points that are relevant and update the language a bit so that it uses phrases from the job description. Chat GPT is great for this if you want it to take your points and line them up with the description. You don't need to spend a massive amount of time on this with AI tools but you WILL get filtered out if you're not doing this.
4. Realize that you're likely going to have to do this on your own. Services are great, government programs are great, but ultimately, there are a million more jobs out there than these places are working with and if you want the best chance, you need to be applying and reaching out on your own. Try to make connections with people, reach out to the recruiter after you've applied and ask for 20 min of their time to learn more about the role, etc. People hire people that they like and know, so become that person. When you have to go through a middle man, it makes that personal connection more difficult. 
5. Finally, be realistic, patient, and persistent. You are NOT going to get a job if you're only applyign to 1 job. You're probably also not going to get a job if you're applying to 1000 jobs because there is no way your applications will be tailored enough. Find jobs that you're interested in, put in some time on each one, and make sure you're putting your absolute best foot forward each time. Treat finding a job like a job. Set aside 1-2 hours M-F where you are going to search and apply for jobs. When I'm looking, I like to target 2-3 applications a day, 5 days a week, and I plan on doing this for at least a few weeks. If you're just throwing in an app here or there, you're not going to get anything. It's a numbers game and lots of other people are looking

Outside of all of that, we all have an uphill battle because we bring extra ""risk"" with our hearing. No one is going to say that to your face but the deck is stacked against you because you have a disability. My advice is to just own it. You don't need to bring it up right away unless you need accommodations and if that's the case, just let the recruiter know that you need accommodations. Be clear about what your needs are, be professional, and be polite. 99% of people will make sure to help you out and if you run into a place that is put off by it, it's not the kind of place you want to work for anyways. 

Finding a job sucks but just keep at it, stay positive, and make sure your applications are GOOD. Be consistent with that and you will find something. Best of luck friend!

I found the job,  not VR. I went to the job interview and asked most of the questions.  They were surprised,  and they hired me immediately.

Begin company myself!

The best way to incorporate ASL in your stream is to hire an interpreter. As an ASL student, your expressive skills will be awkward for a while. If you try to simcom, your ASL will suffer. Trying to include a little sign language often leads to less access for Deaf people. 

IMHO, using ASL for clout when it’s not your primary language is wrong.

1otvwqv,deaf,Advice I wish I could give my younger self,"There is a list of advice that I wish I could have given my younger self when I first became HoH and started going deaf. So in case anybody else needs it, here is the advice I would have given my younger self:

(Also, please note, this is something specifically that I would have told to me. I know me. Some of it may be helpful for you too, but it's really important to find what works for you!)

* Learn sign language. Even if most of your community is hearing and doesn't know sign language, knowing sign language will unlock so many doors to help, new friends and communities, and will give you a way of expressing yourself and communicating with others that doesn't rely on your ears or your voice.
* Don't be afraid to look for accessibility and accommodation and ask for it if you can't find it. You'd be surprised by how many places have accessibility options already in place, you just need to know to ask for it. This goes for everything such as:
   * subtitles on movies/shows (for movie theaters you can go to open caption showings or ask for a CC device)
   * live music/theater performances (if you're asking for an interpreter make sure you ask as far in advance as you possibly can as the interpreters need time to prepare). 
   * **DOCTORS!!!** (and other important appointments/help). Do not risk not understanding something or not having yourself understood when your health and wellbeing is on the table. If you know sign language, they all have interpreters/interpreting services on hand. If you don't know sign language or are not adept at it yet, make sure you tell them that you're deaf/HoH so that they can make sure to face you when talking, write things down, etc. 
   * Your workplace. It can sometimes be scary to tell people that you have hearing loss. Even if you don't feel up to telling all your coworkers, it's really important to minimally tell HR and your direct boss so that they can help make sure you have what you need at work. (RIP younger self me who didn't want to tell anybody and so ended up getting assigned to handle phone calls for the company. RIP my younger self who was left inside the building because I can't hear fire alarms. (P.S. They flash now.)) 
   * Your phone. Find the accessibility section in your settings and turn on things like TTY (teletypewriter) for phone calls, transcripts for audio messages, etc. 
   * etc. etc.
* Find and make some friends who have similar realities and experiences as you. Sometimes you need advice, a good rant, or just a friend who knows to tap on your shoulder before talking to you.
* Drive-thrus. They are all trained (or should be) on how to accommodate hard of hearing and deaf customers. When you go to the drive-thru, you can skip the mouthless intercom and pull right up to the window. You can then tell them you're deaf/HoH and that you need to read lips and then give them your order or if you're not comfortable talking/reading lips, you can write it down and show them. They're really very friendly and helpful about it! 
* Music. Don't do what younger self me did and grieve over music that I can't hear anymore. Do what much smarter older me does and become a rock/heavy metal enthusiast. Crank that stereo up so loud your windshield rattles. Go totally punk over the BRR BRR BRR of the drums and bass. (Do be protective of your remaining hearing though.) Also clubs and live concerts are great for this!  
* Be okay with being you. This is just good life advice that I needed hear and follow in general, but it's true for your hearing too. I show off my hearing aids, I tell my friends that I'm HoH and crack jokes about it so that they know it's okay to laugh and and talk about with me, I sign in public and love that it catches people's eyes and makes them curious, I wear oh-so-many deaf/HoH t-shirts and hoodies (the punny ones are the best). Being okay with being you also means being okay with being sad or angry or confused sometimes. But mostly it means being you and being curious, creative, happy, excited, nerdy, talkative, punny, and all the other wonderful adjectives you are.

Yeah but what if sound hurts your ears. I’m going deaf and I cant sustain loud volumes or be in places that have impulse noises like car horns and beeping machinery it’ll ruin more hearing.

Love this! Something I'd add from my own experience is: don't be afraid to play around with your settings. I used to just stick to the default mode and wonder why everything sounded off in certain places. Things got way easier once I started switching profiles depending on where I was.

1ots8yf,deaf,Question about interpretation,"I am a hearing individual with a somewhat personal question for the deaf/hoh community. This is in no way meant to be offensive to anyone. I am just curious. 

If you were at a weekly meeting with a choir singing in front of a roomful of people, and you noticed an adult individual incorrectly signing in said choir, would you be offended?  Is this a common occurrence?  Has anyone dealt with this before?

[댓글]
It depends. Is this hearing individual doing it to be accessible or to make themselves feel good? Do they accept feedback or resources to cross check, or do they get offended when you offer it to them. If it's the first options, I'm excited. If it's the second options, I'm offended. The point of including sign in a choir is inclusion but if you're not willing to include the people you're doing it for, then it's not really accessible.

I think this is common. 

If there’s regular deaf attendees then they probably will and should give feedback. 

Also sometimes it’s just air guitar. There is no one receiving services, just like for optics or to practice. 

Interpreters at churches are usually just volunteers. 

Depends on how incorrectly too. I would imagine like songs, choirs are open to loose interpretation.

Offended isn't quite the right word. I'd cringe at the embarrassment. And feel frustrated that we're supposed to be grateful for this ""interpretation"" and ""exposure"" to ASL that will maybe inspire others to learn ASL. Blech.

First off, few questions... Why is there a choir at this particular meeting? Is the person signing, in a position where one's focus should be concentrated? Do they know they are making gestures associated with sign language? If so for what purpose?

Now as for **my** response, I'd pay no attention. But, I've personally never experienced anything remotely similar to your situation.

1otn6ev,deaf,How to improve a monotone voice as an oral deaf person?,"I was stuck between posting this here or on the autism subreddit but I ultimately decided this would likely be my best option since my deafness does play a big part in this.

I was diagnosed autistic when I was younger and have been hoh then deaf from childhood. I was put into speech therapy which was pretty successful. I don't have much difficulty with pronunciation, so much so that most people wouldn't guess that I'm deaf from my voice alone.
What I do seem to be struggling a lot with however is my intonation.
Ever since I can remember I would get scolded for having an attitude when I spoke even though I didn't have one.

With helpful feedback from  my partner I've realized that this is because there seems to be a disconnect in the intonation I think I'm using versus what I'm really doing. I sound flat, monotone, and sometimes outright annoyed even when I am trying to sound excited or engaged. I can hear myself somewhat with my hearing aids on, but I'm still not picking up on this.

My partner has been stopping me (at my request) when he notices that my intonation doesn't seem to match what I'm trying to express and that's been very helpful in helping me know what I can work on, but I really don't know how to work on it.
Speech therapy is not an option financially at the moment, but this is important to me.

If anyone who is willing to share has had a speech therapist work with you on this, I'd love to know how it was done or any other tips from anyone else. Or if you just want to tell me that this is going to be pretty impossible without a speech therapist then I'll gladly take the honest response too 😂

(friendly disclaimer: For those of you who speak, you don't need to ""fix"" the way you speak to meet hearing standards. This is just something that is important for myself that I would like to improve for my own mental health. Whether you speak in a more ""typical"" way, have a deaf accent, or don't speak at all it is beautiful and you have nothing that needs to be fixed. I simply feel that for my circumstances working on this would help me have less stress when communicating orally.)

*Speech therapy is not an option financially at the moment, but this is important to me.*

This is going to sound ridiculous..... but given your financial situation, have you considered looking for voice acting (or acting with speaking focus) tutorials on like youtube and such? Suggesting this because, anecdotally, I find my intonation is connected to my facial expressions and I tend to mask really hard when I'm conversing with people and giving really over the top expressions and tone changes - but it sounds like that's kinda what you need? Do you think your hearing is at a level where you could self-teach like this?

Idk if itd be an improvement. But just make yourself more emotional with voice.

I have the same issue to an extent with facial expression. Only thing i did was just mess around with it more to get used to changing it so it becomes more of a habit.

hey! I'm also autistic and I spent a few years working on this because people in my life were complaining about my monotonous voice.

First, I would make sure this is something YOU want to do, not something you're doing to appease your partner because it takes a lot of work for barely any reward (personally, I regret wasting time on it).

I started by watching videos from expressive (over the top) people and trying to copy how they spoke. I'd break the video into sections with the transcript on the side, use my old IPA charts from speech therapy as a kid to try to figure out how they might be moving their tongues inside their mouths for areas i can't lipread, and would basically repeat each 30sec-1min section over and over until I felt confident, then move on to the next. After doing this for like a month or so, I moved on to trying to do it in my every day speech. There's a kind of bounciness in your throat that my friend explained I was missing (moving tone up and down throughout) but after a few months of that I am honestly more expressive in my voice than my actual emotions (my sign language matches better to how I genuinely feel) but it's honestly tiring and not worth the effort. I'm so used to it now (9 or so years later) that idk if I could go back to my old way of speaking but I wish I could.

Just speak naturally. I’m totally deaf but people can totally pick up on how I’m feeling with my voice.",2025-11-10 19:21:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1otn6ev/how_to_improve_a_monotone_voice_as_an_oral_deaf/

My teacher is deaf and cant hear when children are talking over him while he is teaching. I do my best to let him know when kids are yelling but its really hard because sometimes he is really paying attention to his computer on he doing something. I dont know how to help, i dont know what the best options are. Are there any devices that flash or vibrate when a noise reaches a certain level. If theres anything else i can try to do to help him please let me know, because at this point the kids are taking advantage of him.

Most people deaf aware when talk happen around them. 

If teacher not ask for help suggest allow him/her find solution. 

Think kind for you desire help, but desire help why?

Noise not bother teacher bother you. 

Maybe explain teacher noise impact your learning and ask how can learn better with distractions.

Have you addressed this issue with the teacher to discuss possible solutions?

I wear watch name sound awareness.

Very expensive (&gt;$1000 US).

I have only one deaf friend who appreciates when I tell him what I hear and help him in this way. Most of my Deaf friends prefer I not ""help"" unless they specifically ask.

If the noise is distracting to you, perhaps you could try sound cancelling headphones with white noise?

If you feel the kids need to be quiet because they are bad and need to follow the rules, this may not be your business.

Did the teacher ask you to let them know?

There are some like this and a few more kinds:

Sure, I got implanted not too long ago and a few weeks ago I was outside at night and there was a noisy cricket. It was the first time I've heard one in about 30 years, so I stood there for a bit to listen to it.

Lol! No, usually sound is annoying and messy for me, but that’s because I remember how clear and easy it was with normal hearing. I used to love music, but don’t listen at all these days. What I do love about listening is that you can do other stuff at the same time. Like listening to radio, podcasts or books while walking, exercising or cleaning. That’s super convenient. It really talks good sound quality for me to do that these days, though. I don’t long for hearing birds, traffic or other sorts of stuff.

it depends on the sound! I love constant noises (running water, for example) but I hate varied ones because I have to work really hard to decipher what is happening and get overwhelmed. one of my research partners used to make fun of me because I ""heard"" better without my hearing aids, since there were fewer distractions to lipreading.

I just want to hear again properly. Like full dB ranges and frequencies. Goddamn I miss listening to stuff or watching videos. It’s crazy how fast it went away , in the blink of an eye. I will say I’m very close to hearing aid requirements for my Audiologist but they are still denying me. They said they wanted me to get more severe or something, I don’t know behind the masks and glass dividers I couldn’t pick it out fully. But I’m afraid of what sound will sound like with hearings aids tbh.

Oh yea been wearing hearing aids since i was 3 now i am 52

I love outdoor nature sound that not loud lol

I'm a photographer at renaissance faires in my area. (in the official sense). One of my longtime ren faire family usually plays a historical character and is very good at projecting his voice (honestly, I can hear his character's laugh from halfway across the faire). He's also the founder of a singing group (they're called Shanty Shipwreck Crew). Last year, the first year with my hearing aids, I got to hear him sing outdoors with the group. I nearly cried because he sounded so good. The very next day, I was inside the castle and it has those high arched ceilings. The crew sang again, but inside the great hall with those ceilings. I actually DID cry. 

So, I do sometimes seek out sounds. I love the quiet nature noises in the mornings. I can hear my cats purring with my hearing aids (but not without them).",2025-11-10 16:22:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oti6rz/anyone_like_listening/
1oti4ne,deaf,Sign Language- Do You 'Babble' To Babies With Your Hands?,"Question to parents who are raising your kids with  sign as a first language— Do you babble to your babies with your hands when teaching them to speak?

By that I mean making meaningless but expressive hand gestures for your baby to imitate 

When teaching our baby spoken language we were advised to make baby noises to them, like 'goo' and 'ga', so they can copy us and practive their vowel and continent sounds.    
I Wonder if there's a similar practice when teaching a baby sign, to get them to practice communicating with their hands? I Have heard before apparently babies raised by deaf parents will 'babble' with their hands, 

[댓글]
Hmm. This is actually a fascinating question. I'm not a parent, but I don't think I've ""babbled"" to a baby before. The most I'll do is like jazz hands before swooping in for a tickle or go in and boop their noses or play with their hands, wave at them. But now I want to see what other people say.

Yes! They have done studies on this with babies raised in SL using house holds.

Hearing babies in signing house holds will both babble and mabble (Manual+bABBLE) starting at the same time that hearing babies in hearing house holds are expected to

Deaf babies in signing house holds will mabble and babble at the same time as expected in the normative developmental process but are likely to stop babbling as time go on (depending on the individual baby and level of deafness), this is speculated to be because they don’t receive the same auditory feedback and if they are also in a deaf household because they don’t get the same social feedback as they would with hearing parents

Deaf babies in hearing non signing households will babble and are more likely to continue babbling than ones in non signing houses because they receive the social feedback of them verbalizing

Not a parent but I’ve seen parents exaggerate signs (typically with more animated facial expressions) or focus on certain signs that babies tend to learn, like milk. They would move the babies’ hands and repeat signs often. 

It may not be the same babbling you are talking about, but babies still pick it up and start to babble themselves.

I work with deaf kids as a deaf adult, and absolutely yes! They do babble. As they learn more you can usually catch a proper sign, followed by some more babbling.
In terms of communicating with sign to deaf babies, we often position our signs so babies can see the face. (Ex mama is signed more off to the side rather than straight on) Our facial expressions are exaggerated with kiddos, pauses are longer and signs may be a bit slower.
Repetition is also great, one of the kids I work with is working on some new playground vocabulary so I sign
YOU WANT SWING? WE GO TO SWING! Really just repetition of what we are focusing on.
There definitely is “momeese” language within signed languages. Mostly kids will copy signs and “play” with them. And this is always encouraged as well.

I don't have kids myself, but I have friends who have Deaf/HoH children. I guess I do kind of baby babble with them in a way. If they talk to me with their hands, I mimic their baby signs and babble back to show that I saw their hands and am seeing what they're saying. It's definitely baby babble signs: hands opening and closing, making random movements, mouth shapes, etc. But they get really excited when they see that I'm paying attention and talking back to them and I think it helps reenforce their communication skills. And I still sign with them in normal sign language too and where possible show them what I'm talking about (make sign for dad, point at their dad, etc.).

Why not ?? Have fun teaching baby

Talking real language to children is much better than babbling goo and gah. Same with signing. Or any language. 

Babies babble. Adults communicate.

I’ve never been told to make baby noises to babies. I’ve seen some people do this but I think it’s kinda silly.

I’ve always spoken to babies but sometimes in a higher pitch voice or sing song voice.

With my deaf son, I didn’t babble with my hands. Although, perhaps unintentionally I did given I’m
a hearing person learning a new language!

But my deaf son certainly did babble with his hands, it was super cute.

no, babbling is not something every parent does. my family does not babble with babies, we talk to them as if they have full language development.

my deaf friends with deaf babies just model ASL. however the children do not copy sign for sign they copy and evolve as they develop language skills. like the sign mom, full opened hand- the child might have closed hand….

As a hearing father, I do make up signs, mostly because I am only learning ASL. It is the most natural form of communication and done since the beginning of time. It is extremely important to deaf children to have any form of communication, regardless if it is made up

Please to those of you who think talking/signing in “baby-talk” to your child is bad, do your research.

Infant-directed speech, or for the older people, “motherese” (I hate that term) is critically important to a child’s development!

I dislike fake baby language because babies work hard learning our languages and were misleading them with fake languages? Don’t sit well with me.

When I have babies around me I would sign to them but simpler. I taught my hearing younger sister to sign and she did her first proper sign at 8 months old.

I don't know what country you're from so can't recommend specifically however if there's Deaf Clubs / Deaf Events near you, I'd recommend going to those regularly as conversing with native Deaf signers will help you sign less ""English"".

ETA: from your post history you're from the UK, so definitely Deaf Clubs and events! Facebook is usually the best way to find your local Deaf Club

Good events to attend (off the top of my head) would be City Lit open day (in April I believe), Deaffest, and Deaf Rave, but also look in your local area for more specific events

I enjoy watching Visual Vernacular, for that mental part. Not to try to execute any of the sophisticated depiction skills myself necessarily, but to break away from thinking in English sentences. It helps open your mind to concepts of visual language, beyond just putting the words in a different order. The use of space, gaze, role-shifting. You can be present for the narrative, conscious of it not being word-based. Your brain can't automatically try to ""translate"" each sign into an English equivalent. 


Then, you take that mindset and learn more about classifiers. That will level up your visual depiction skills, to help break away from those word-for-word sentence constructs.

1oskxwm,deaf,reported my old audiologist,"I posted before about how they called me out of the blue 5 years after I stopped going to them. 

to recap and add context: I'd stopped going because they made me uncomfortable after the audiologist was kinda 'oh....' when he asked why he hadn't seen me in a few months and I'd answered honestly that I'd been in the hospital for mental health reasons. then he refused to sign paperwork for a disabled bus pass saying he didnt do that, even though he'd signed the same paperwork about 5 years previous. i asked them at the time for my audiograms and the receptionist said they would call when they were ready to be picked up and they never called. since they were across town, and I'd had such a poor final experience, i chose never to go back. I ended up buying cheap hearing aids from some internet company a couple years ago, and then a better pair from the same company this year.

flash forward to this September, the lady had asked me if I wanted to come in, and I said 'i bought new hearing aids from someone else...'

'oh, so you dont need to see us anymore?' (she sounded kinda rude at this point.)


'no, but what I do need from you is my audiograms. I would like them mailed to me.' their office is on the other side of town and is difficult to get to during the day when I work overnight. 

she told me that she'd have to talk to the audiologist about getting my audiograms ready, but I'd have to come in person to get them. they dont mail those. that didn't sound right, but i didnt know better, so I just said okay and hung up.

well, again, that was early September. I vented on here back then about how ridiculous it was that they'd contact me out of the blue like that. and someone told me that they HAVE to send them to me by mail if that's how I want them. I looked it up, and yes, it's HIPAA law.

they didnt call me for over a month, and in late September i ended up with kinda disabling ankle pain in both ankles, so i couldnt really go out there anyway. they still hadnt called back in over a month and a half, so I left a voicemail October 23, and another one November 1, both saying 'hi, let's not let this be another 5 years before I hear from you again. I know it's HIPAA law that you have to send the audiograms by mail, so you need to call me to get my new address. if you need my email to get a signature, I'll happily give you that too.' 

still no call back. so I googled 'what do I do when my audiologist refuses to give me my audiograms?' on Thursday and it gave me the complaint form for the Oregon speech and audiologist board people. I made an official complaint. I asked 'can YOU make them give me my papers?' they emailed me on Friday that someone would get back to me with the investigation soon. that made me feel good, that it seems to be taken seriously.

[댓글]
That's ridiculous and you have every right to be pissed. My place emailed me the notes and audiogram when I asked. No HIPAA threats. I'm in MN. These are YOUR medical records, you paid for them. Make sure you get the notes, too, in fact, ask for your whole file!

I too am having a helluva time with my audiologist. Not quite as bad as this. But in general they just don’t care. Like I didn’t ask to go deaf. Treat me with the same respect you’d want.

Well done! Good on you for self advocacy. Pettiness (theirs) is not a valid reason to break HIPAA. Hope this is quickly resolved in your favour. You gave them many opportunities to send you YOUR audiograms.

Can your new audiologist contact them to make a transfer request?

Thank you for reporting them and continuing to advocate for yourself. That can be so hard for me when I’m seriously under it with mental health. Advocacy anger is one of the first motivators that comes back to me - I guess because I want to help other people not have the same experience and that’s easier to think about than what I’ve been through. I love that you are persisting for yourself and also for everyone else that may go to this audiologist in the future in the hopes that they won’t have a similar experience.",2025-11-09 14:36:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oskxwm/reported_my_old_audiologist/

Your parents are likely the ones who can't stand seeing you act totally deaf and that is THEIR shame/convenience issue not yours. As a minor, you're still at their mercy. In my case, mom taped mine to my head. But maybe you can play along. Put them on but leave them turned off, or turned down. As an adult I only put mine on when I know I have to deal with the hearing world. You might not win this battle, but you're not alone. Many of us choose days off and others choose not to put them on ever again.

Hearing people just don't understand how much work it is listen/hear at a level that makes it easy for them. It will be rare to get them to fully understand, but it can be a good learning experience for them.


 Explain that it's very taxing to use your hearing aids and some days you just can't handle it. Use a polite but very matter of fact tone. Be friendly but not apologetic. Be very prepared to use alternative modes of communication, such as paper and a pen, or transcription app. When possible, give people a choice (having a choice can disarm a person's objections sometimes). 


If you haven't already, start learning the sign language of your country or region. You might be surprised how useful it is.

I’m Deaf, I use a wheelchair and hearing aids. 
 
I’d compare sign language to my wheelchair, not my hearing aids, it’s not exhausting any muscles I don’t have, and fully enables me to move in a way that works best for me.  

When I get home, the aids come off. I even take them out at work on breaks and as soon as I clock out, I don’t do unpaid labor.

Hearing fatigue is real and extremely common.

I have severe hearing loss in both ears. I started to lose my hearing when I was 16 I'm 28 now. I will take hearing breaks everyday. I go to work for 9 hours come home and take my hearing aids out. It forces my family to use the little sign language they know but it is what it is. I shouldn't have to wear my hearing aids all the time just to make others lives easier..it's too exhausting forcing myself to focus on what I'm hearing so I take breaks and that's ok.

It ur choice!! I do that all time if they don’t like boo freaking hoo!!!!

Been wearing hearing aids since i was 3 now i am 52 pretty soon willl be 50th

I broke mine out when I was 5 years old.  Never wear them ever again and I'm almost 40 years old now.

I’m 36 and I have gone years without my hearing aides. If anyone gets mad they need to speak up. It’s not your job to meet them at their level 🫶

I wore both.. until I realize I could never hear out of my left. Straight up told my mother. She said ok. 6 months after I started going to a deaf school, I stop wearing the other one. 

You don’t owe anyone wearing them. Wear when you want to, don’t when it’s a hassle.

I take breaks all the time. I’m deaf, and I’m allowed to be, regardless if hearing people feel unaccommodated. They don’t like it when we go “au natural” because then they would have to work as hard as we do. Not my problem.

1osj54y,deaf,Does Otter have LARGE TEXT?,"I have Otter pro on a Pixel phone. It works fine if I need to simply record something like a meeting and review it after the fact. 

However, I want to use it live, for captions during meetings but the text is tiny. I've looked through the program's settings and I can't find any way to adjust the font size so it's about an inch big on my phone screen. 

I have poor vision, too, so I end up using Google Transcribe for interactions but that program doesn't separate voices and too often it's garbled. It also seems to only work well in very limited environments with clear speakers. 

Mom's nursing home insists Otter is a ""good enough"" accommodation for use during critical meetings about her care but I have tried it a few times already and the tiny text isn't readable live unless I hold my phone up to my face but then I don't see the speakers, other things going on, notes, papers, etc. 

Any suggestions to make Otter viable for low vision? Am I missing something I can change? The font on the phone is already set larger but that doesn't seem to affect Otter text. 

Thank you!

In general, the ADA says that auto captions are usually not good enough unless used by a professional voice writer. 

For Otter specifically, you can make the type bigger on a phone, but I couldn’t find any of the other setting adjustments for blind people. A CART operator is the best bet for effective communication.",2025-11-09 13:17:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1osj54y/does_otter_have_large_text/

Will my children be able to learn in school better if i begin to teach them in a young age „complicated“ things? Idk how to phrase it i hope you all get it😭 because i often see deaf families on TikTok, where e.g the father is deaf, everyone else hearing, but they’re teaching the kids to communicate with their father. I love that. I want to do the same. But what if no family member is deaf. Should i still do it? Why not? 

[댓글]
You should, it's always handy to know another language. I'm learning German myself.

Using sign language with hearing babies is increasingly popular now, because babies can communicate in signs earlier than spoken words, so that isn’t weird to see. Once the child starts to use spoken language comfortably, the parents usually stop using sign language (also because they don’t know more than the few signs they learned specifically for their baby). 

Continuing to use sign language with the child as the child becomes older can be harder. The child may not be interested. The child may not use sign language often enough to remember the signs. 

I don’t know about Germany, but I know in the US, we prefer people to learn from deaf ASL teachers to 1) give deaf people jobs and platforms (we have plenty of ASL resources by deaf ASL users so it’s 99% no excuse) and 2) make sure the learners are actually learning it right. I’ve seen hearing people insisting that they know how to sign it right when they actually don’t. They just didn’t know they’re signing it wrong. So, for hearing parents who want to use ASL with their hearing children, we encourage them to learn together by using child-friendly ASL resources made by Deaf ASL users. We don’t expect perfection from those hearing families, but honestly, at the same time, I think we also don’t expect them to continue using ASL long term. If they do, we would recommend taking ASL classes and finding Deaf communities to ensure the signs the child learn are correct. We don’t want the child to use wrong signs and accidentally teach others wrong signs. It doesn’t help them and us with communication.

I think you are overthinking this.

The general rule against *no hearing people teaching SLs* is more about paid courses, online instruction and teaching using spoken language. You can show your friends how to sign or teach your loved ones in private - but its best to always be honest about your level and status (e.g. hearing, know XYZ Deaf people etc).

&gt;Will my children be able to learn in school better if i begin to teach them in a young age „complicated“ things? 

Yes?

I don't 100% get your question but again this feels like overthinking it.

Children learn A LOT of things. You can absolutely set your (future) children ahead by giving them skills early.

//

Also babies benefit from sign language because they can usually use it to express their needs before they can speak. This is why Baby Sign is a thing, albeit done in a bad way (a whole different discussion).

100% teach your (future) baby some sign language to use with them, and then ideally carry on with classes when they get to an age where that would be appropriate (if that is what they want to do).

That sounds fantastic! I wish my parents had learned sign with me. 

You can start now by going to a DGS class taught by ein gehörloser deutscher Lehrer.

In the future, you can continue to support proper sign learning by going to classes with your children.

So I have hearing aids but even with them some people are mostly incomprehensible. Especially in the office I work in which has pretty bad acoustics. 

I still use all the usual coping methods - lip reading, puzzling together what I think the person said given the context, always talking face to face (which hearing people don’t seem to understand that I need them to do). 

I can never join in the quiet (juicy gossip?) conversations people have while they’re at their computer, not even needing to turn their heads to each other. It’s lonely, but I’m continually making my peace with it.

It’s probably really obvious to people when I’ve checked out of hours of “pardon? Say it again?” I’ve told people things to do to make it easier for me (I need to see their face, please don’t put your hand over your mouth, don’t talk to me from another room etc). 

I guess what I’m saying is that hearing aids aren’t the magic fix I thought they’d be when I got them years ago and maybe I need to go back to my ENT specialist to see if there’s anything further they or I can do.

Do you use any assistive listening devices? Having a specialist microphone which further zooms in on speech may be helpful.  Is it possible to use the office messenger app to chat as a group instead? Like Teams but then again, employers can access logs if they wish to.

As you mentioned, HAs do not restore hearing to normal. This, in itself, is a major part of the journey of hearing loss. Once I accepted it, I have been less harsh with myself about what I am supposed to do or not.

I think of the times I cannot engage with office banter/chit chat as my brain resting from ""noise"". I suppose I am lucky I am not particularly inclined for ""gossip"". I have told my colleagues not to be offended if I don't engage - probably makes me ""boring"" to work with but at the end of the day, I am the one dealing with my listening fatigue. My ""battery saving mode"" helps my well-being which is more important than gossip.

Even with the best of conditions and people following the strategies you mentioned, there will be times you will miss parts of the conversation or lose the thread of it because of a million of variables (e.g. lighting changes, people moving, looking away for a crucial second because of a sudden noise). Heck, even people with normative hearing do miss bits of conversation. Having hearing loss just makes us more aware of what we miss.

Worth discussing with audiologist in case they can make some tweaks to programming - but as a long time HA user (and retired after 35 years of office work) you are right to observe HAs are not a magic fix. Long days can be tiring. I also found that acoustics make a difference, and generally being positioned with my back to a wall was better as sounds would mostly come from in front of me. In meetings it was even more important to get a good spot and in presentations I’d ask the speaker not to stand in front of a window so I could see them/lip read. There’s no easy way around all this, just lots of little things that can make it better. Keep asking for adjustments and never apologise for doing so.

This is why I’m firmly in the deaf community and work in the community in ASL now. Hearing aids if used all day give me a migraine, and even with decent hearing/speaking ability, I missed a lot. It’s not really worth it for me anymore.

Yea I could never figure out what everyone is always whispering about 
My life is better off for it!

I relate to this experience so much. You’re not alone. I say keep your head high.

I’m a believer in technology…perhaps one day hearing devices eventually become close to natural hearing.

1origzn,deaf,How should I have handled this situation?,"Years ago, back in the early 90s, I took both SEE and ASL. Life events did not allow me to pursue the path I had wanted and I no longer feel fluent in either. Lately, I have encountered more situations in which I wish I had my fluency such as this evening. I 100% believe in not jumping in immediately, to allow people to have their own “voice”. This evening at the store, I noticed a situation between a customer and the self check out employee. This employee I’m familiar with, I gig work and do a lot of orders out of this location. She has the same facial expression at all times and doesn’t move her mouth much when she speaks. Idk whether the customer could lip read or not but with this employee it would have been difficult. The customer was an older woman and looked on the verge of tears. I typed out what the employee was telling her and I helped until the situation was resolved, the customer thanked me, but now I’m having that self doubt of did I over step and take this woman’s voice away from her? How should I have handled this or how could I have handled it better? I absolutely did not read what the customer was typing to the employee, she was capable of that herself, I only typed out what the employee was telling her.

The thing that makes it worse is he's been told he legally has to do it yet just tries his hardest not to. bro the terp just uses ASL next to you. it's not that hard to just yap and not care about it.

I'm extremely worried that nothing will actually happen about this. It's the same with denying SNAP, all of my friends are Deaf. Some are worried about buying food or just don't have any food because of that. With the numerous Deaf schools closing due to cut funding, i just can't help but think ""When will it end?, When will it stop?"" All of this to hurt a community and culture you don't belong to or interact with. for nothing.

The issue I'm having is that my laptop webcam automatically adjusts in Zoom to magnify and center me in the frame.  **I have disabled the Auto-Framing setting and it still continues to do so.**  This means if I sit back from my laptop it will still tighten the visual field to just around my face.

1oqalay,deaf,I just found this community and I'm partly deaf in both ears. I've been legally deaf for nearly 2 years,"I'm 33f England🇬🇧. I suffer from tinnitus in both ears, I just got used to of the ringing in my ears because I had it since I was a child (I dont want to trauma dump people. Lets just say, my home life, wasn't loving). 

Ever since i got my hearing aids, everything makes so much sense now. Before I kept saying ""what"" or ""can you please repeat it"" and i just nodded along, pretended I heard them, when I didn't. A lot of people thought I was being rude because I couldn't hear them. Now, I understand why. 

When I first got my hearing aids, it was overwhelming at first. For example; when I went to the dentist, before i couldn't hear people talking to themselves. I thought that was normal. When I got my hearing aids, i could hear them!! Even people walking past me, them just chatting amongst themselves, I couldn't hear them. Now I can? It's insane. Hearing everything, was mind-blowing. 

I feel like I missed out so much, because I got my hearing aids in late 2022. All the times when people thought I was being rude, no, I couldn't hear them. 

I might look into sign language, to help me further in understanding people. Since, when someone is talking to me from afar, I still can't hear them. Idk tho if the NHS will cover that, or might take private lessons.

Idk where this post is going lol. Thanks for reading my ted talk 🤣

Welcome!!

&gt;I might look into sign language, to help me further in understanding people. Since, when someone is talking to me from afar, I still can't hear them. Idk tho if the NHS will cover that, or might take private lessons.

Unfortunately, it does not. BSL is great, but not cheap. It isn't considered medical enough for the NHS to proscribe either - and there is a whole history of conflict between doctors and the Deaf community. Anyway! My advise is - get in touch with your local Deaf club or similar, see what they can do for you and what resources they can forward to you in your area :)

BTW - there isn't really such a thing as ""legally deaf"" in the same way as there is with ""legally blind"". Legal blindness is a legal status which actually allows and disallows a bunch of things for blind people (e.g. cheaper TV licence!, but no driving - and, weirdly, some tax differences). Deafness is a spectrum and there is no specific moment you cross from being hearing, into hard of hearing into deaf - and no real specific legal differences of being deaf versus being blind or any other disability. Sorry for the nitpick tho.

Like I said up top! Welcome!

Welcome!

Do you know you can get a disabled persons train pass now with having hearing aids 

Also bsl dictionary is recommended but be careful as some of the signs are regional variants :)

Welcome to the club! My hearing has stabilised of late, but when it was at its worst, I could completely relate. BSL isn’t exactly cheap - but if you can pick up languages ( fairly ) easily, you’ll have no problems. It’s such an immersive and expressive form of language. If I was any good at learning languages, I would have made it my primary language, but alas I’m not! Good luck!!

I highly recommend a lipreading class, I'm new to hearing aids too and I'm going to a class and it's been amazing, not just learning lip reading but also being around other people who are going through the same thing as me. We swap information and tips and it's so good. Also, see if your local adult education college does any kind of course on living well with hearing loss, I got really good information in a two hour class and it was free of charge!

Thanks for sharing! It’s always interesting to read all these different perspectives and experiences. Glad you are hearing better now.

It’s the best club ever!!! Welcome!!!

What does legally Deaf mean? we dont have that in the US

You likely have language deprivation too. 22 is a long time to go without visual language to get in.

In that setting there are virtually no live captions that can distinguish voices with all that background noise.

Some venues offer captioning, but signed interpretation is more common. You could also ask for a set list or see if there’s one posted beforehand. 

You have to call the venue months in advance to check what they have available and schedule it, then check back several time before the event to make sure it’s set up.

My interpreters offer me a peek at the setlist if I want. There’s also a [website](https://setlist.fm) where you can find the setlist for recent shows by an artist. You can ask the people at the sound booth to snap a pic of their setlist. This question may be better answered in r/aslinterpreters. 

Your friend can also ask for CART ahead of time, if they don’t know sign language. Most venues have no idea what it is, so be prepared to offer an agency that can provide the service. Most interpreting agencies offer CART.

I don’t know if it’s the same for concert venues but when I go to Broadway shows they give me this device scrolls captions of all the lines in real time.",2025-11-06 19:10:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oq7wjf/live_music_lyrics/
1opphwv,deaf,Daughter born with hearing loss,"Hello, my daughter is almost 8 months old, we have hearing aids coming in 3 weeks.

Moderate to moderately-severe loss in both ears to the higher frequencies. It drops pretty fast after 500hz, 250hz is probably within normal range.

I have learned most of the common ASL signs via youtube videos and books. I was not planning to becoming fully fluent in ASL. 

Should we become fully ASL fluent?

After reading posts here, I do not want her to resent us in the future.

Any advice or suggestions would be hugely appreciated, we both love her so much.

Yes. ASL is very important. Keep signing to your baby. And he/she will pick up the  language fast.

Keep signing. Hearing loss can always get worse. Devices can die. Devices can break. There can be background noise. She can just get tired! I think last I saw posted from a deaf audiologist the statistic that even students with *mild* hearing loss miss ~25% of what’s said in the classroom, sometimes even more!! 

There are zero downsides to your family and your child being bilingual. 

Even if she ends up preferring to speak for herself, she may still prefer to receive information in sign; it’s also possible this will change many times through the course of her life as she grows. PLEASE learn sign. Please encourage her sign. Do voice off time as a family. Get a Deaf mentor through your state. 

Learning sign language is the best thing I’ve ever done for myself. It gave me community, shared identity and experience, communication skills, and complete access to information I was previously missing. 

Good luck!

Please learn ASL to at least some fluency. 

Dinner table syndrome is a very common thing among deaf people (being in social situations with family and feeling excluded) it often crates resentment and distance. 

Social gatherings are among the hardest things to navigate even for people with moderate hearing loss (nose, multiple speakers, speaking with food and drinks)

It can be intimidating to face learning a whole new language when you're already learning how to care for your baby. But please see it as a gift. You have just gained access to a wanderful, creative and resilient community, with it's own heroes and artists. It can give your child and yourselves soo much

It's also normal to feel scared and mourn the image you had of your kid's childhood. But their future will just be different, not ""worst"".

Highly recommend watching some Deaf content to try and see what this new future may look like

As a kid that was mainstreamed: get involved with the deaf community NOW.

Just think of the worst cases:

You become fluent in ASL and your daughter later doesn’t want to communicate in sign lange? Nothing of importance lost, learning a language and not using it is still good for you.

You don’t become fluent and your daughter wants to communicate in ASL. You and her both will not become as good as of you started early, you might not be able to communicate with her in her later years of she learns on her own and she will be worse than native speakers. Worst worst case.

Neutral case:

You don’t learn and she‘s not interested in ASL. She will occasionally have a hard time in school, in social life, but she won’t know what she’s missing.

Best case:

You and her will grow up bilingually. You will have connections to a community you’re not aware of and might make friends along the way.

I always advocate for learning sign. Worst case scenario she is bilingual by choice. However, many deaf/hoh kids spend their lives isolated from their families because they can’t communicate with them or only communicate partially. Look in your area for a deaf mentor. Look for signing services (these often are to teach the hearing family to sign).

Please learn sign together, as fluently as possible.  Learning languages = earlier communication = less stress trying to be understood.  

Hearing aids are exhausting.  They can help, sure, though they’re not cures…  Have your audiologist start the volumes a bit lower at first, to help ease them into them, not just first put them in unprogrammed, blasting loud, blasting feedback, &amp; causing distress &amp; pain.  Wear them in quiet places first, then work up to busier places.  “Deaf fatigue “— overstimulation &amp; exhaustion from listening / hearing through loud hearing aids IS a real thing.  If you want to know what kiddo is hearing, get either a hearing aid listening stethoscope, or just put them in your ears, &amp; you’ll get a taste of how…different… life is.  😉

Also, give kiddo some autonomy when they wear them—especially since you’re learning sign!  

Oh!  CAPTIONS!!  Start using captions on everything, whenever possible!!  Trust me, you’ll adjust quickly, &amp; will even find them beneficial yourselves!  Captions help with hearing, understanding, &amp; reading!!  ☺️

\&gt;Should we become fully ASL fluent?

Yes, please it's well worth it. I'm telling you from the point of view of a post-lingually deaf person that didn't get to learn ASL until I was a young adult. 

\&gt; After reading posts here, I do not want her to resent us in the future.

Don't worry about that, There's no single right answer and no matter what, when she's 30 she'll realize that you just did the best you could at the time.  This is a damned if you do or damned if you don't kind of thing so just do your best. 

\&gt; Basically my questions are to do with how do we support her? My wife and I both hear fine.

Be aware that as she grows up, you don't really know what it's like to be your daughter. Being self-aware about that will go a long way.

Congratulations on your baby daughter! I am a speech language pathologist and the daughter of a Deaf man. The key to support your daughter is to give her every tool possible that makes sense for her and your family. It's good that you are getting hearing aids. I would strongly recommend that you and your spouse learn ASL. There is a common misconception that learning ASL will inhibit a child's language development, but actually it's the opposite. Giving her access to a language that she can easily see will actually support her learning an oral language like English as well. ASL is also a beautiful, amazing language. It's something that will benefit your whole family to learn.

Please learn it. Hearing aids are not like glasses where you can get 20/20 hearing. It just simply amplifies or stimulates whatever inner ear hairs are not dead yet. Please learn it for when they have migraines from trying to lipread e eryone, learn it for when they’re exhausted, overstimulated or feeling very different. Learn it to model to the world why it matters. Learn it to make up for a 110 year ban on sign language that had caused so much harm to deaf children. Learn it because your child is deaf. Learning to speak and lipread is strictly for accommodating the hearing. We need accommodation too. Learn ASL please.

I was your daughter. No one learned sign or taught me sign, I was not involved in the Deaf community in any way.

Now I don't blame my mom as she was a single mom working a ton and going to school at the same time to keep us afloat, but the reality is that I have been very isolated for most of my life and have a weird in-between worlds existence as I am not hearing nor in the Deaf community. 

So if you have an opportunity to learn sign, do it. There's nothing wrong with both of you being bilingual.

I want to echo what everyone else has already said about ASL being important.

But also I want to clarify - you do live in a country that uses ASL, right? That is primarily America and Canada, but a few others too. If not, you should look into the sign language of your country/region because it is the Deaf community of your country/region that your daughter will grow up to live in.

Don’t forget that studies have shown that learning ASL as an infant leads to improvement of language and literacy skills overall, for any child deaf or hearing! There’s really no downside! You’ll have a happy child who can communicate with you, even before they are developmentally able to articulate vocally. And the studies show that they will have improved cognition and larger vocabularies later on if you start early.

TJ and Kylee on Instagram should inspire you. Father and daughter, Kylee speaks and use ASL. TJ learned ASL for his daughter. They make funny and educational videos. 

  
Byeee. (Kylee always say this)

I’ve found it so incredibly important to not only teach your child asl but your family as well. 

There are so many free resources. Take advantage of as many that your life allows time for! It just takes time to find the right ones and sign up.

My son is the only Deaf person in our hearing family, and he has a hearing aid. We have a deaf mentor (a Deaf/hoh person) who comes to us weekly to teach the family, a speech therapist for working on vocalizing, and a DHH instructor who is hearing but works with Early Childhood Intervention in our school district (even though my son is not even 2 yet.) there is also the parent infant program at our states school for the Deaf, I think they have those at most Deaf schools

Lots of great feedback on here!

I would also contact your local Deaf school. Many have early intervention and play groups that start from birth. They'll also be in the know about the local Deaf community and resources.

In addition to signing yourselves and having access to the Deaf community, if y'all plan to do screen time there are YouTube channels with amazing Deaf storytellers who read books.

also fwiw, **pls** allow choice and autonomy in how often and for how long your child wears their amplification. Audiologists push for ""as often as possible,"" but a 1:1 appointment in a quiet doctor's office is very different from the 24/7 auditory experience of the real world. Kids **will** find a way to take off their amplification, and more often than not it will be in a way that completely loses or damages it.",2025-11-06 04:30:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1opphwv/daughter_born_with_hearing_loss/
1oppdny,deaf,Minimizing intrusion in Deaf spaces,"
I don’t know how to phrase this without sounding slightly silly but just hear me out. 
I’m hearing. I started studying ASL on Lifeprint over the summer, and am taking ASL 1 currently. I’m 21F, graduating this semester and planning to continue my studies online in the future.

But that plays into my dilemma- I understand I need to have immersion in the Deaf community and with native signers to improve. However, I also have social anxiety disorder. My SAD, even with treatment, will absolutely prevent me from going to ASL events- it already has- but I’m trying to fight that 

There’s a lot of misconceptions on what SAD entails so I’ll boil it down to this: it’s the phobia of negative social judgement- such as embarrassment, say from being a beginner learning ASL; or causing offense, say from intruding in a space I’m not welcome in. The thought of going into an ASL event and knowingly intruding makes me feel physically ill, and I’m not being facetious when I say that.

That’s not to say I’m going to pick some private, all-Deaf event and walk right in- even if I was that rude, SAD would prevent that before the idea even formed. The idea of being bad at signing in a public setting is just anxiety-provoking enough on its own, I don’t want to be bothering Deaf people while I’m doing it. 

TLDR; I was just wondering if there were any kinds of ASL events that you’ve been to/know about/seen around where beginners were more expected?

(And I don’t mean to be rude here but I’ll just save us all some time- any advice along the lines of “just get over it” really isn’t going to cut it. I understand *what* I have to do. I’m just asking for the best way to avoid intruding- as much as possible, I know I can’t completely- from people far more immersed in their community than a total outsider.)

[댓글]
Where do your classmates go? Sometimes it helps to attend events with at least one peer on your signing level. But if your classmates are attending various other events/socials, that’s typically your cue that it would not be an intrusion for you to attend as well. You can also ask your teacher for pointers on events. 

But I guess the issue isn’t that you don’t know where to find them, but you’re anxious about how deaf people will perceive *you* specifically as opposed to any other signer at your level? 

At mixed events like, say, monthly socials at Starbucks, we expect to meet beginner signers. It’s a judgement-free zone. You’ll be corrected, taught new signs, etc., but that’s completely normal. If no beginners show up to our events, that’s actually a problem—where is everyone? If the students aren’t learning from us, where are they learning from? Show up! 👍🏻👍🏻

Many ASL coffee chats are beginner friendly, and some events such as my Deaf school’s homecoming draw many HS ASL classes (we have HS ASL classes from 2-3 hours away coming to our homecoming!). I think the reason ASL classes like my school’s homecoming is because the students can wander around and people-watch until they feel brave enough, and buying at the booths is a short, somewhat predictable experience so they can practice their signs before approaching a booth. 

I know the homecoming season has ended, but similar events to that would be Deaf marketplaces, fairs, or sports events (some schools will be hosting Deaf sports tournaments), non-sporting competitions (academic bowl, robotics, chess, etc) where there might be booths or concession stands, activities, and/or entertainment. I’ve seen ASL classes attend school plays, but that doesn’t always provide opportunities to interact. 

ASL teachers usually have a list of events that are beginner friendly, but you can also find Facebook pages for your local Deaf community and search there. If you’re comfortable doing so, make a post asking for beginner friendly ASL events. 

There may not be exactly the same events in your area, but hopefully you are getting some ideas here.

Maybe meet with your ASL teacher and explain the situation that you are having with wanting to continue learning ASL but need help with meeting people without feeling like you're intruding. Go slow,  maybe your teacher or fellow student knows someone who is deaf/hoh that maybe willing to work with you one on one and introduce you to other individuals gradually until you feel comfortable going to those bigger group gatherings. You can do this!😊

When you look up Deaf events, you can often email to see if students are welcome. They usually have some events specific for students your teacher likely can help you find some.

1opn42i,deaf,How do I move on from my dream jobs that I can't have,"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to ask those who wanted to pursue a certain career but were unable to, due to being deaf or especially partially deaf.

I myself wanted to be a fire-fighter or even join the military/air force, but know I am unable to due to my partial hearing loss. Even volunteer firefighting was something I thought I could do, but I dont think I will be able to.

How do you move on from those dreams, especially since the fact that I could have possibly done it, if I was full hearing. I just need some advice any is appreciated. 

I do work at a fulltime job and everything is good there, its just those dreams that I really truely wanted and know I can't have.

My son-in-law is a firefighter/paramedic. You can be a firefighter, it just depends on what level of deafness you have and if where you are is able to get you the assistive devices that you'd need. 

He's worked in large cities and in small towns, but hasn't worked with anyone who was deaf yet (he's been doing this for around 17 years).

If you want to do relief work check out https://www.offthegridmissions.org

They are an ngo that offers support to the deaf / hard of hearing community during emergencies

I’m a paramedic who’s partially deaf! I know multiple other paramedics with varying degrees of hearing loss, and have seen multiple firefighters with hearing aids, even one with a CI. 

We use amplified stethoscopes that often connect to our aids, and maybe do assessments a bit different, but I promise I’m more than capable of doing my job. You likely are too, with the right accommodations!

Hi! I’m hearing, but I definitely know of a few Deaf firefighters in the U.S.  Not sure where you are located, but if in the U.S. you’re right about not being able to join the military, but you should still be able to pursue being a firefighter! Good luck!

Who says you're not able to be a firefighter or join the military? There are many deaf and hard of hearing firefighters. There are also several countries that allow deaf people to join their military.

Volunteering for a local search and rescue organization might scratch that itch.

The military I believe is based on your level of loss. I’ve seen firefighters fit with hearing aids and work in the field

You can work for a company developing technology for fighter aircraft’s. If you get to the right job there, it will feel meaningful to you. Becoming an aircraft technician could be more possible?

The rescue service does much more than just fire fighting. What if you worked with fire prevention? That could be a practical job doing inspections and information, administrative, or even strategical. You could do research on fire fighting or develop technology used in fire fighting.

Also consider totally different fields. Sometimes we prefer to do something totally different. Be a bit creative when it comes to what work might be creative for you. Look for role models, both Deaf and non-Deaf, and drive to learn from those who you see do a good job.

I’m a Deaf nurse working in the emergency room. I’ve seen news articles about Deaf and hard of hearing firefighters, though I do believe the military is out of reach, at least in the US. What does your communication look like? Do you use ASL, technology, lip reading, a combo?

Maybe you will have a hard time becoming a firefighter directly… but why not look into other forms of employment that works alongside firefighters? Selling fire trucks/engines… firefighting equipment… fire investigations… etc?",2025-11-06 02:34:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1opn42i/how_do_i_move_on_from_my_dream_jobs_that_i_cant/

This could easily be school dependent but my (Scottish, BSL, higher education w/some childhood ASN educaiton) understanding is that SSE (Sign Supported English) is being favoured over Makaton as it works better for actually building useful language skills.

1opfr2v,deaf,can loud noises still damage residual hearing?,"i'm new here and i figured this would be the best place to ask this.  
for context i have severe hearing loss, bordering on profound, and i really like music. because i have such a love for listening to music and have had since before my hearing got substantially worse (yayy genetics 🙄), i worry that if i turn my music up too loud i'll damage any hearing i have left. i know 80+db of sound can damage hearing over prolonged periods, and that the higher you go the more damage is done in shorter amounts of time. but is listening to my music really loud going to damage what i have left?

[댓글]
Short answer: Yes.

There are a lot of factors that can play into this. The reality is that deaf people can tolerate louder noises because it takes a higher amount of amplification to get their cochlea's hair cells moving; as a result, 80+ dB of sound won't have the same negative effects on your hearing as it would have for a hearing person. Listening practices aren't as clear-cut for us, and the ""80db rule"" made by the WHO isn't nearly as relevant to your case. We're not going to be able to give you a specific dB ""limit"" unfortunately, however, the reality is that you can still further damage because your cochlea's hair cells can still move. ALWAYS play it safe.

There’s no reason it wouldn’t. There’s a reason “avoid sounds over 80 decibels” is a thing. I’d rather protect what I have left as much as possible

It depends, if your loss was at say 80dB and you play music at 80dB, likely not but if music is at a higher dB than your hearing range, then yes

Are there any audiologists on this sub?

Yes

[댓글]
Nah. I hate multiplayer games that rely on voice comms. Last I checked, Discord doesn't even have live captioning either.

Short answer, no. Long answer? It can be.

Discord doesn’t have built in captioning but they do allow bots, which aren’t perfect but are better than nothing. 

The problem is it’s not client side, you have to either own the server or convince the people who do to add them and set them up - this requires perms and a new channel.

Honestly I’ve had some awful situations when trying to ask people to add these specific bots or something that does the same thing, let alone taking turns while speaking.

It heavily depends on the group and what it’s for - text chats are okay if you can read/write English - and video calling is great. There are a few Deaf/hoh groups that video call and play games, but hearing focused ones aren’t exhausting for me personally. 

I can focus on signing in the corner of my eye while playing a game, but lip reading, checking captions, and using my aids while playing a game? No thanks.

I use transcript (speech to text) and text to speech bots along with my own software. Even with those I can barely keep up in large or busy groups.

Transcript bot: https://scripty.org/invite
Text to speech bot: https://www.stmanager.co.in/

The other ones I use are windows 11 live captions and ttsvoicewizard, I also use these in game as well.

1oov7rs,deaf,Learning Auslan,"Hey guys! I was hoping if anyone could give me some advice or share their thoughts on a current dilemma I’ve been having. For context:
I am deaf and have been my entire life. When I was young I did learn some Auslan(Australian sign language) however since I leaned towards English more my parents decided to stop having me learn. Now I am 18 and have been feeling incredibly out of place in the world as I realise how different the world is for me and I really want to connect more with the deaf community.
I want to learn Auslan but I don’t know how I should go about it. In Australia you can learn for free and get a certificate out of it, which can be very helpful to add to the resume for future jobs. However, learning Auslan in an academic context just feels… wrong?
It feels like something I should already know or be learning in a community, so while a certificate would be good, it feels like something too personal to go about it in that way. Like, if I’m going to have to learn another language, sure, but considering how much it connects to my daily life it feels very incorrect. I was hoping to learn Italian as well with a diploma, but it doesn’t feel the same.
I really don’t know and it’s probably not that big of a deal, but because it’s something I’m so connected to, it doesn’t feel right to have it be apart of my academics. Any thoughts would be much appreciated.♥️

[댓글]
Hi! Learning through certificate *is* learning in a community, and you are far from alone in being a Deaf person who didn't have access to Auslan growing up. If you chose to do the course there is every chance you won't be the only deaf or hoh person there, and there almost certainly be parents of deaf kids too. If you want an intense full on training in Auslan it's totally the way to do.


It *is* a long and intense course though, it is free in some states sure, but it's still a huge drain on your time and energy. So it's also fine to learn through community level classes, and by making signing friends. It's a slower process sure, but maybe that would feel more comfortable for you? 


There's a bunch of Auslan groups on Facebook you can join to find out about meet ups, I would def suggest posting there and asking to connect with other Deaf people who learned Auslan later in life, or just start going to Deaf and Auslan videos and meeting people that way. 


Basicly there are perks to both, whichever you chose isn't wrong, and I think it will all feel better once you make other signing friends 💚

I assume you're in Australia? (This is an American Sign Language form btw but most want to make sure you're learning the correct sign language for your region. :]  )

If you were ""supposed"" to know it you would already know it. But you don't so you go take a class same as everyone else trying to learn. Don't overthink it. You don't want to not learn it or struggle through and learn less than everyone else who could humble themselves enough to take a class because you're thinking too hard about why you don't already know it.  You will probably need both class time and social time to get good fluency now that you are an adult and hours of immersion are harder to come by. Everyone is a beginner at everything they try at some point in their lives. Not having learned it and retained it the first time isn't particularly special or anything.

1oorl96,deaf,Opinions on hearing aids/CI for autistic 3yo? Moderate sensorineural hearing loss.,"Basically the title.

My 3yo was admitted to hospital a bit ago and while we were there a nurse expressed concern with his hearing. 

It too us fucking ages to actually get his ears tested because he is non-cooperative at the best of times and he didn't feel well. They didn't want to sedate him due to medical concerns at the time.

Anyway he was eventually diagnosed with moderate hearing loss, probably from birth or very early infancy. He was premature &amp; has had a severe issue with ear infections his whole life.

He seems to hear low sounds okay, and he's non verbal anyway so it's not like it'll help his language development?

We've been given resources for supports and things, but a lot of it doesn't apply to him. Sign language is obviously the best initially avenue but we've been trying to learn sign for ages and he doesn't pick it up whatsoever. He has a few signs sometimes but prefers hand over hand or vague yelling. 

The only other option we've been given is either hearing aids or cochlear implants.

I've tried to look it up myself but everything seems very drastic from one opinion to another - it's abusive to force it on children vs it's abusive to leave them to struggle. 

I don't know where to go with him. No one seemed to have experience with autism &amp; hearing loss in regards to aids.

I was wondering if there was anyone here who has opinions on the matter?

Preferably autistic &amp; deaf adults, but parents of older autistic &amp; deaf kids (or people with experience in the areas) would be great too.

I hope this makes sense. I'm so tired lol.

[댓글]
I would be surprised if a child with moderate hearing levels was a candidate for implants at all. Hearing aids are typically the suggestion for that.

There are programs for kids with autism and deafness. Some of them start as young as 3. I’d suggest you look into those. Exposure to fluent signers takes many “nonverbal” kids to fluency shockingly fast. If you guys are struggling to learn and teach he’s not likely getting enough exposure to language. 
 Hearing aids can help some kids get more language exposure. But, a lot of autistic kids struggle with sensory overload. I’ve worked with a lot of deaf autistic kids that would throw their aids/processors when they’d get over stimulated. Hearing aids are much cheaper to replace than the processors.

Just because he doesn't speak doesn't mean that language development isn't important.

I have a hearing autistic son, who was delayed at developing language.  I initially blamed covid lockdown. But then his initial attempts at sound production sounded ""off"" in a way that made me think it could be his hearing. We waited months during covid for hearing tests. The first attempt had no cooperation, so it was months more.


I had signed with my first son, who was hearing. His first words were in ASL; he was signing before he could talk. But he quickly followed with spoken words too. (Despite the common myths that it would delay speech.) 


So when we thought Second Son wasn't hearing, I redoubled my effort at signing with him. And that's how I knew before the final test arrived, that he had a *language* issue not a speech or hearing one. We finally got through a hearing test, and confirmed my hunch. 


Eventually he got an Autism diagnosis instead. 


Autistic kids can have trouble with physical movement skills, AND with ""mirroring"". They also don't have as much joint attention, which slows language learning opportunities. Sign language doesn't come to them naturally, it takes more time and effort. 


One thing to do is sit side by side when modelling, instead of face on. (I'm also autism-adjacent, and some signs with complicated movement I need to learn by turning sideways next to the teacher.)


Another thing to do is try AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication). You can go through an SLP to get properly matched with a specific program or device. But facing wait lists, we just jumped in ourselves. Cough Drop and Weave Chat are two AAC programs you can install on any tablet or phone, and there are others. 


At first I was afraid screen time contributed to autism, and put away all the devices. But I pulled one back out to try AAC, and I can't recommend it highly enough.


All the ""joint attention"" language exposure opportunities he missed from other people, he made up for by mashing all those buttons. Just scrolling through the categories, listing word after word. Over and over. Until one day, he started to repeat after a word. And another. 


Use visuals to help build language, and communication. Some AAC programs let you customize icons, and you could use ASL signs instead of or in addition to icons.


My son is 5 years old now, and has developed some good language. He's finally coming around to an interest in learning some signs. Which he is still awkward in trying to copy. He'll hold out three random different fingers every time he tries to do ILY, and ask me to arrange them properly. 


I remember watching and reading some resources about using AAC *and* ASL for supporting Deaf Autistic kids. 


https://youtu.be/yDFylIIYzMk


Don't assume he'll always be non-verbal. Even if he isn't fully verbal, there's always room to gain communication skills. Autistic language develops over a longer period of time, and requires extra input. Your son has less input. So it will take longer. You need to just keep on exposing him to as much visual language as possible.


I'm not Deaf, and not qualified to comment on what hearing devices can bring to the table. But I know a thing or two about sensory issues in autism. I would delicately question whether a CI would be more acceptable than a hearing aid, sensory-wise. That's a huge gamble, and I personally would hesitate to put my kid through the risk of surgery and destroying any residual acoustic hearing. I'd try the hearing aids to the extent of his tolerance, but lean heavily into visual language. AAC, ASL, poster charts, visual schedules and routine cards, etc.


You're doing a good job, asking questions. The best advice I get for my kid, is from adults with similar experience. (Professionals have been less helpful.) Keep on keeping on. You've got this.

Hi. I’m autistic and have hearing loss. CI was never recommended to me - and my loss is similar. I would strongly urge you to learn Sign. Even if your child picks up verbal communication in the future ( I don’t know how likely it is for your child ), having Sign will allow them a method of communication for the time being. 

I’d definitely recommend Behind The Ear - don’t stand for anything less; I was originally given MiniRiTE aids and they were never right.

Autistic adult here with severe sensory processing problems in all areas. 

A CI would be sensory torture if he already struggles without it. Probably hearing aids too, but that is much less invasive. They make hearing aids now that filter out background noise and help people hear so each more clearly. Unless he actually has hearing loss, I don't think amplification will do anything but make him take them off.

As someone who didn't have full access to language growing up, thank you so much for using sign with him! I would continue focusing in this direction and aim to be fluent in a signed language. If I would have had access to a complete signed language growing up it would have significantly changed my life for the better.

As someone with severe sensory problems I feel confident that I can speak for most Autistic adults in saying ""Thank you!"" for your willingness to hear our perspective. It's highly frustrating to see parents, educators, therapists, and doctors who don't understand and won't listen. 

My speech and language were delayed because I couldn't understand. Focussing on speech when you can't understand or speak is not helpful. 

I was nonverbal and randomly yelled at people, I later went on to work on some of the most advanced military technology in the world. I mostly learned English from reading and still can't use it to connect to other human beings.

*I forgot to emphasize the importance of exposure to sign beyond learning on your own at home. I think someone else mentioned it as well.

I work with DHH students. We currently have two who use an AAC  (Augmentative and alternative communication) device - basically iPads/tablets with picture cards on them.  They can be VERY complex or very simple depending on the program and the user.  One of the children is autistic, the other has cerebral palsy and struggles with some sign language. I will say the autistic child does have some difficulty with expressive sign language, but not NONE.  

He's still very young - don't give up yet on sign language, but using communication boards (picture cards on paper) and/or an AAC device can be helpful to pursue. You'd want to talk to a Speech Language Pathologist about that, and they may be able to help with insurance for that.

Right now I'm in Nijmegen by RadboudUMC but my experiences with Radboud has been.. ups and downs but mostly on the issue I have with CI is that my hearing is not improving at all or keep worsening and experiencing some pain with hearing (specific electroduces) and with just normal hearing sounds. My hearing has been getting worse ever since my electrodes stopped working (11 out of 22 broke) in 2021 (Also before when I didn't knew about broken electrodes yet so basically since 2019-2020) and went under surgery to replace all of them + new implant due Nucleus 7 not supporting the old one I had. Now 2 or 3 electrodes are off due to the pain I have with high tones. That could've made it worse for my hearing which I get that.

We tried doing programs where the sounds would be higher then I am used to to try to improve hearing but it hurt for me and even tried to get used to it through the weeks but didn't helped sadly. And then they just gave up and came up about that my autism or stress is impacting it and all I need to do is just.. relax or therapy and that they couldn't do anything else anymore except for changing programs, turning on or off for electrodes or testing. And to make it comfortable as they could. (My mental health wasn't very down bad and it's been improved so much through the years thanks to therapy so I always believed that wasn't the issue)

It crushed me, because I genuinely want to improve my hearing since I'm struggling hard in my life with communication and hearing sounds or music. I loved hearing things, phone calls, music, sounds that I recognize or movies/games where I could enjoy the sounds from there, but that joy went away long ago when I started to experience those and all people who I know or knew who has CI is very confused why I am experiencing this. I feel alone and lost and my (autism) brain has very less clarity about this and not knowing if this is even normal or if it's something I have to accept.

I really want to learn more about why I am experiencing this pain and unable to improve my hearing. Were they totally right about unable to do anything else for me? Is this worth over for a second opinion, and if so, where would it be the best place? (Netherlands) Or would LUMC already be the best option? Or anywhere else in that matter? Because I know it depends high on a person with their experience.",2025-11-04 18:50:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oofp2n/advice_about_second_opinion_netherlands/
1oochg5,deaf,For those who had a CI or used hearing aids and ditched them ... opinions wanted,"Hey everyone!   
Long story short. I was born and grew up totally normal hearing. Became 100% deaf as an adult (five years ago, to be exact). I've worn ultra power hearing aids ""most"" of the time (meetings at work, etc). My boys and I all learned sign language, so when I'm home, we communicate with ASL. I'm a candidate for a CI but don't want them. 

My question is, is anyone who's also profoundly deaf, that was wearing hearing devices or using CI, etc. and then just decided they wanted to just ""not"" use them anymore? I get so frustrated because even with sound, I don't understand everything (yes, they're properly adjusted for my loss), and I just feel like since I can't hear many things anyway (even with sound, I don't hear the frequency of any type of siren, alarm, or other certain noises), etc. 

Thinking about just going about, ""being deaf"" without sound 100% of the time. Anyone else ditch the devices and just ""be deaf?"" I can use interpreters for medical appointments, etc so I'm really  not concerned about that part of it. Thanks for any opinions from those who've ditched the sound.

1onv4kr,deaf,"I'm not deaf, I am autistic though, and I think this might be the right place for a very specific and peculiar question?","Like the title says, I'm not deaf. I guess my hearing could still be considered impaired because of audio processing disorder but that's actually not related to my question, I just thought of it. Anyway, I'm autistic and lately my sleep has been particularly effected by my sensitivity to light and sound. I have to keep my room cool cuz if its too hot I get overstimulated, so I bought a big air conditioning unit thing to keep it cool. It's not too loud during the day, but at  night when its the only sound in the house it gets to me. I have ear plugs that I wear when I need to block out overstimulating noises, like traffic on my way to work, but I can't wear them to bed or I'll miss my alarm on my phone, which I already sometimes do if I roll over and its too far away from me cuz I have to keep that quiet too. Any louder and I could wake up having a panic attack. I thought about daylight alarm clocks, that gradually brighten the room until you wake up, but lights also overstimulate me often, including the bits of sunlight that I can't manage to block out of my window. I've covered all the lights in my room with bits of tape and other things cuz all of it keeps me up. 

  
I remember watching a video some years ago about different accessibility tools used by folks who are blind or deaf or wheelchair bound, some of the more visible disabilities I suppose. I like watching videos to learn about disabilities, ones I do and don't have, I guess to learn more about myself and my needs as well as those of others. But anyway, one of them was a wrist band thing that vibrates as an alarm clock for deaf or HOH people, which always stuck in my brain for some reason. And more recently I realized it might be a great solution to my problem. I did some googling and poked around amazon, but I didn't really see anything that seemed right for me. A lot of the options looked kinda cheap and unreliable, with reviews saying as much, others were surprisingly expensive, and a lot of them had lots of bright lights and also made noise. 

  
So I guess what this huge rant all leads to is if anyone has any recommendations? Something comfortable to wear while sleeping that doesn't make noise and doesn't have bright lights all over it. It'd be cool if it had a watch on it, had a companion app to set alarms in, and looks good enough that I could wear it out in public without looking like some weird thing is strapped to my wrist, but those are all just cherries on top, bare minimum is just something that works and doesn't have lights on it

1onv2ma,deaf,Divorced Parents Disagreement Over School Placement,"I’m a Deaf mom and my ex-husband is hearing. We divorced when our Deaf son was a baby, and I have primary custody. We share joint legal custody. Our son is now 9.

For years, his father never participated in his IEP process or educational planning. He was fine with me handling all decisions as long as I informed him. He lives an hour away and has our son on weekends. His dad does not sign. 

This spring, I requested an IEP meeting to discuss changing placement because our son is struggling socially in the mainstream school, being bullied, and not thriving with hearing peers. It was the first IEP meeting his dad ever attended — and he only came to say he disagreed. His reasoning was that he wants our son to have “equal opportunities like hearing peers,” and that the Deaf school is too far (4 hours away).

I want our son in a Deaf school where he can develop social skills, understand social cues, and build friendships with kids like him. He deserves to belong, communicate freely, and feel safe — not isolated or bullied.

Has anyone been through this situation in court? What was the outcome for you? I’d love to hear other families’ experiences when one parent supports Deaf school placement and the other opposes it.

1onsiuz,deaf,Hearing ASL 1 Teacher at Deaf School,"I would like to vent that there is a hearing person teaching ASL 1 at my local Deaf school. She is dreadful and talks the whole time and I can't understand her speech. When I didn't understand her spoken question she laughed at me for using the ""poof"" sign and talked to the other students about it, skipped me, and stopped including me in the class. She knows she has HoH students and even offered to sim com, but when she gets talking her sign just drops off. I switched to ASL 2 prematurely because of this and the teacher is Deaf and awesome, but they had to combine the classes last week and it was awful. I'm disappointed in the school, but my frustration helps to fuel me to study more independently, hire a Deaf tutor, and go to more Deaf events. 

What bothers me the most is that the hearing students love the spoken format and praise the hearing teacher, and give positive feedback. I've complained but their response is that they know, but that's what they've got right now. I know they are actively trying to hire, and the Deaf community is small here, but I'm still disappointed. 

At least my ASL 2 teacher is awesome and she said the ASL 3 teacher doesn't talk and he's really good too.

I'm still hearing but have some neurological and physical difficulties understanding speech sometimes and it's getting progressively harder to understand speech.

1onbnsw,deaf,work and disabilities,"Hello (English is not my first language, so I apologize if there are any errors). I am looking for a job and I don't know what is available for someone who is deaf (I am not completely deaf yet, but my doctors think I will be in the next few years). I have always wanted to work with children, but I don't know if that's possible. 

I saw a social worker who helps people with disabilities find jobs they can do, but in addition to my hearing loss, I have balance problems (I'm not sure if that's the right term) because my auditory nerve has been damaged. 

All the social worker suggested were jobs where I would be behind a desk, such as a secretary. I don't want to do a job where I have to sit down all day, and even though I can't walk straight, I can still move around properly. 

I don't know what to do. He doesn't want to help me find anything else, and I wonder if he's right and I should just settle for that.

[댓글]
As someone who works, lives, and breathes with children, yes, you can absolutely work with children. I am Deaf and use ASL. 

Does this social worker know there are Deaf doctors, Deaf lawyers, Deaf Teachers, Deaf business owners, and nearly every other occupation?

U can be anything u want to be. There no stopping us

I am hearing, but just chiming in to let you know of some jobs that Deaf people I've known have worked:

1. Daycare teacher (my youngest loved her so much!).  She was able to talk with a Deaf accent and signed.  The owner knew ASL &amp; my daughter loved signing with her (see you later alligator in ASL was my daughter's regular goodbye lol).

2. Pest control - at a past job our pest control guy was Deaf!  Very friendly guy

3. One of the Deaf members at my church (I help interpret at my church) has done so many things!  He was just in Europe--he has grown kids now, a mohawk, and drives a motorcycle!  He is always on the go!

4. Medical billing!  She had a closed caption phone, as per ADA.  She was great at her job (I worked with her).  She never learned ASL.  She spoke with an accent.  She was such a gem--she was such a joyful person to work with!

Please don't let this social worker make your options feel limited.  If you want to work with kids, you can!  

Are there any Deaf schools nearby?  That may be a great option for you to work with children!  If there are particular fields you are interested in working in, you might google ADA accommodations, or go to askjan.org, to see what accommodations may be available to help you go into a career that you want to be in

I teach music children! 

Sit desk option, but not only option.

You want do what?

Decide then learn accommodation for how!

I am deaf. I work at my library shelving books.

My high school teacher was Deaf! He taught us ASL :) Even if you don't want to teach sign, I'm sure you could still teach because we understood him fine.",2025-11-03 13:24:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1onbnsw/work_and_disabilities/

1omunt6,deaf,The Silent Worker,"I'm hearing, but as I said in my previous post I got down a really interesting rabbit-hole about the history of silent film and deaf culture and think it's a wonderful history that should be more known. I hope it is okay to share another discovery I think is very cool and that people might enjoy.

I found this incredible archive of a deaf newspaper from the late 19th and early 20th century called ""The Silent Worker"" (Possibly the most badass newspaper title ever devised IMO) and read a little bit of it.  The first article I struck upon was one advocating desegregation in South African deaf schools, in a newspaper from ***1896***, which is undeniably very cool.  They also have an article with unfortunate terminology about caring for and understanding deaf farm animals (specifically pigs). An article on the history of naval ships, and an article on deaf football players, and a gardening section.

I personally love history, and I love working class history in particular, and frankly, everything I've read in this newspaper is really fascinating and delightful no matter whether one is hearing or not.

I have so many questions but I'll hold it off but the important question is how do you feel that there is hearing teacher teaches ASL and openly admitted she won't be able to translate ASL if she interacted with deaf people. She requires us learn her way of sign. I feel like this might be wrong. Here is her video, should I report or what's the proper way to approach this? 



[댓글]
I think everyone can agree that she’s not qualified, regardless how they feel about her being hearing. 

Many of the signs are wrong (incorrect placement, movement, etc) in this video. I can guarantee you won’t learn how to properly sign with this.

If she’s part of an organization, church, school, or official business then you can report her to someone in charge or climb the ladder. If she’s on her own? Essentially nothing.

I’d suggest leaving her class, and assuming she’s local you can make a post or comment about her to let others know. 

Oklahoma school for the Deaf offers free online courses, the signup period has passed though, so you’ll have to wait for the next. 
Lifeprint on YouTube (Dr. Bill Vicars) is an amazing resource you should check out, it’s 100% free and easy to follow along. 

See the FAQ for this subreddit for more resources ☻

Fwiw for learners trying to vet resources - if a ""teacher"" is flapping their lips for the majority of the video and only Signing a few isolated vocab words... It's **not** a good resource.

The most you can do is comment on her video that she shouldn’t be teaching. Then expect to get blocked. Audists don’t like getting called out by Deaf and allies.

so first of all not a fan of a hearing teacher but setting that aside

If a teacher said ""won't be able to translate ASL if she interacted with deaf people"" they should not be teaching .. your flat out saying you can not use the skill you are teaching. We have one person locally who has said similar because she teaches SEE and advertises it as ""teaching american sign language"" .... Sort of same she has NO clue when you sign ASL 

This video actually makes me ill to be honest.

I wouldn't learn French from a German, or Spanish from someone from Japan. I wouldn't learn Klingon from a Star Wars fan (humor moment). Why would I learn ASL from a person who is hearing ? This seems like another Lola to me.

Just my two cents

Forget everything else. She’s not qualified. If you cannot deceptively understand ASL, there’s no way you can teach.   As far as hearing teaching ASL, that’s a long soap box for me. Do I think every deaf person can teach? No. But I don’t believe hearing people should’ve be taking livelihood from Deaf people either. I’ve been passed up for jobs because I’m not hearing. I’ve been pushed out of a job because I requested accommodations. Not even by speculation. I’ve had people outright admit as such and sadly the EEOC and ADA are so overwhelmed they either don’t take the claims or you never hear back. 

I’ve had students complain to admin because I would not speak during an ASL class. So yeah while my people are still being discriminated against, underemployed and unemployed it’s going to be a no for me to hearing people taking those jobs.

The channel is scrubbed of content

Distrusted it as soon as i saw captions were auto gen, turned it off when ""youre welcome"" was just straight up wrong. I wouldnt use this resource.

She can’t sign! Straight up. I grew up at a school with TC (ASL signs in English word order) which helped me at the time (I still had enough hearing to understand some of what teachers said so switching to the interpreter when I missed something was easy) but she “mispronounces” nearly every sign. And what is up with all the talking or mouth flapping?

Notice how she turned up the music, in the beginning⁉️Wtf would she do THAT!? As if anyone who’s Deaf…would HEAR it ‼️🙄😳

is she is talking? she is mouthing a lot of English vocabulary but not real connection to the info- imagine trying to learn french while writing in spanish … that is only issue. your brain needs to let go of English and learn to focus on visual info.

hearing or Deaf doesn’t matter. some deaf teachers are not that good either.

I kind of feel like this whole post is rage bait. She's a hearing teacher that isn't qualified to even translate? She shouldn't be teaching ASL, end of story, full stop.

The fact she is watching something to try and teach says something about her. 

Please go to reliable sources.

I have noticed that Deaf people who want to teach ASL at schools but schools hire hearing people to teach ASL knowing they are not qualified.

We’re deaf? How are we supposed to understand what you’re saying?

Where is this class taught? Are there many options for asl classes in your area?

Is she earning money from this? She sucks balls

Her video isn't publicly listed. I wonder if she was just doing it to practice? Or did she unlist it after getting negative feedback? I don't know what she says orally.
*I know this post says she is an ASL teacher but there is no way. Maybe this is just someone tracking their progress? She looks like she just got finished with class 1 of an ASL 1 course and is practicing. And the title is the date, not anything about teaching.

I hope you aren't paying for her services, OP. There are a lot of free resources by people with the proper credentials to teach ASL, Dr. Bill Vicars being one. There's no way I would recommend anyone learn ASL from a person without proper credentials like an ASLTA certification and native-level (expressive and receptive) fluency.

""requires us to learn her way of sign""... So learning how to sign wrong?

She isn't qualified, us teaching incorrectly, and  can't even deliver a video lesson properly (body from waist up should be visible).

No, absolutely not okay.  She can't even interpret or communicate with the Deaf?  Why the heck is she ""teaching""?  I only watched a bit at the beginning, but already saw inaccuracies.  I'm not a certified interpreter, but I can communicate with the Deaf/HoH.  I also help with interpreting at my church.  No way in he!! I would make videos to teach people, although I'm obviously more qualified than she is...  If you are going to learn ASL online, either do it through a university or a Deaf teacher.  The audacity to say you have to do it her way?  Even if she was signing correctly, there are multiple ways to sign things and regional variations.  Also, you'll find many differences just in generational differences, just as you will with spoken language. 

Taking an ASL I class doesn't qualify you to teach ASL.  And, sorry, but not sorry, the a handshape yes made me cringe.

I know English &amp; ASL.  I can hold some conversational Spanish.  I know some basic/broken German &amp; Korean.

This would be like me holding online German classes for you.  Just no.

ETA: I reported her video and her channel for providing misinformation.  Beyond disrespectful.

If they start the video talking, I immediately back out and don't engage. A Deaf teacher is best.

To be honest, it’s your responsibility to not attend classes like that. If you were learning French or Swedish, surely you’d expect teachers to be qualified? I don’t understand why you did it differently just because it’s ASL.

YouTube doesn’t check any credentials, you’re the one responsible for doing that. You should also know that you most often get what you pay for. If someone spent years at university getting a teaching degree, and work hard eight hours a day reflecting on how to continuously improve how they teach, surely they deserve to be paid. My conclusion is that you simply never took learning seriously, which is sad, since it can be so rewarding. Reconsider how you’re approaching ASL. Instead of posting complaints like this, start taking studying seriously.",2025-11-02 20:01:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1omr94d/hearing_teacher_teaching_asl/

Which model do you have? When I lost my right cros I couldn’t connect the left at all. 

If you go to your audiologist they’ll be able to reprogram them individually

I don’t know, I have Bluetooth hearing aids myself and they only work when I have both as well. Like when I get ear infections in my right ear, I can use Bluetooth unless I turn on my right hearing aid. I wish I could do each one, because I always have to put my right hearing aid in a case near me just to use my left one. I wish I knew how to help you.

With Phonak, one of the HAs is usually set as the ""master"" for bluetooh. Normally, this is the right ear which then transmits to the left ear. If your right HA is broken, then the left one will not connect to bluetooth unless the setting is changed in Target (fitting software). So it has to be done either by an audiologist or someone who has the fitting software.",2025-11-02 05:10:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1om8zxe/bluetooth/

1om1rwt,deaf,Silent Film and Deaf Culture?,"I'm on a bit of a silent film kick lately, and I ended up thinking about deaf culture and silent film as I have a friend who's an ASL interpreter, and I've found a FASCINATING rabbit hole.  Basically what I've found is that in the pre-talkie era, deaf actors and filmmakers had more opportunities because they had an advantage in knowing how to communicate in a visual manner, and Lon Cheney an actor who had deaf parents, was considered one of the greatest of all time because he'd grown up communicating without sound and thus knew how to use expression and gesture really effectively. There were also films in sign made by deaf filmmakers with deaf actors for deaf audiences.  A silent film in sign could have as much dialogue as a sound film after all, the technology worked for sign and not for oral language, at the time, which feels like an interesting moment.

Also the intertitles of a silent film are in some ways preferable to the captions used nowadays because they don't distract from the action on screen.

I've seen some silent films made by deaf filmmakers today (which are very cool).  There's so much cool history in terms of deaf culture and the silent film industry that is very exciting, and I wondered if films of the silent era are more likely to be watched and appreciated in deaf cultural spaces today because of their comparative accessibility?  Is there much crossover between silent film-fandom and the deaf community today?

I hope this isn't a super obvious question or rude, but I got really excited when I discovered how much there is about this in history.

Edit 2: I found even more stuff!

Here's an article on the period I found: [https://dcmp.org/learn/static-assets/nadh211.pdf](https://dcmp.org/learn/static-assets/nadh211.pdf)

I'm working on finding a free version of an article on the history that's behind a paywall, but it looks like during the early talkie era, there was a small independent deaf film industry, and this reddit comment is super interesting: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k2ob9w/comment/gdxk06y/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k2ob9w/comment/gdxk06y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

Film technology was also apparently very useful for preserving sign, as previously it had only been able to be preserved in still images, which didn't really capture sign effectively, and this was very important to the deaf community during a time when oralism really started to be heavily pushed.

Also, if you're interested in recommendations, here's a film Emerson Romero (a deaf silent film actor, and the man who developed the first captioning technique for sound films) appeared in with Charlie Chaplin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36v8vXM3RXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36v8vXM3RXE)

:

Lon Cheney's FANTASTIC in The Unknown 1927 (which you can find on youtube but it's missing about ten minutes of footage) and of course, his classic Phantom of The Opera 1925 (It's the best adaptation of that story in my opinion).

There's also ""Is it too late?"" which is a film in sign with intertitles in English, so that non-ASL speakers can follow the story [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36v8vXM3RXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36v8vXM3RXE)

The Phantom Carriage 1921 doesn't really have any connection to deaf culture as far as I can find out, but it's A FANTASTIC film

Strike 1925 is also really good, Eisenstein in general is brilliant

It's also cool because a lot of these have entered the public domain, and so they're free all over the place, and because they're pre-hayes code, they feel quite modern sometimes.

  
Edit 3: HOLY SHIT, while digging on this subject and looking for old movie reviews in deaf newspapers, I found an archive of a deaf newspaper from the late 19th and early 20th centuries and it was called The Silent Worker, which may be the coolest newspaper name of all time.

Wow I did not know that about Lon Chaney! What other actors were deaf or CODA? 

I am embarrassed that this is news to me, since I love old movies, and used to watch silent movies with my kid when they were little (until they started refusing anything that wasn't both sound and colour)

I can't hear it running unless I am right there I took off the back so I can see but the water bill is threw the roof. I have two young boys one that is hard of hearing and one with ADHD. I need guidance the water company doesn't care they just say you can't hear the water running.nope I can't and only one person in the house who is hearing. I need help is their an alarm or a trick anyone knows of

1olt2sg,deaf,Community Warning: Misrepresentation in Deaf and Interpreter Spaces – Please Read,"Over the past few months, people in the Sioux Falls Deaf and interpreting community discovered that someone had entered local spaces using several different aliases (Christopher Suttles, Christopher Itai Cardona, Itai Cardona, Harvard, Itai, Suttles of some form) while claiming to be Deaf and highly qualified — with advanced degrees, certifications, and years of professional experience.

At first, everything sounded believable. But as information was compared, inconsistencies began to appear. Agencies, organizations, and community members soon realized that many of the claims couldn’t be verified or confirmed.

This kind of thing hurts everyone. It damages trust within the community, confuses hearing institutions, and takes work away from qualified Deaf interpreters who have genuinely earned their credentials.

It also leads to false interpreter requests, where agencies think they’re booking a certified Deaf interpreter but end up contacting the same unqualified individual instead.

In addition, these situations drain interpreter resources — the person repeatedly requested interpreters for themselves, taking away access from Deaf clients who truly needed those services.

It’s been painful for many who interacted with this person; some feel betrayed, others embarrassed or unsafe. But being transparent about it helps protect others moving forward.

I’m posting this as a community warning for anyone involved in Deaf or interpreting work, both in Sioux Falls and beyond.

If someone claims Deaf identity or interpreter credentials, please take a moment to verify through official sources such as:

* RID (Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf)
* CCHI (Certification Commission for Healthcare Interpreters)
* CMI (Certified Medical Interpreter)

Real professionals will always welcome verification and transparency.

*(Public links and archived sources with verified records will be listed in the first comment below.)*

This isn’t about attacking anyone. It’s about protecting Deaf and interpreter communities from future harm, promoting honesty, and keeping accessibility systems fair for everyone who depends on them.

[댓글]
This person had at least 4 to 8 aliases.  He went by Christopher Suttles, Christopher Itai Cardona, Itai Cardona, Harvard, Itai, Suttles of some form.

Don’t be protective of this man’s true identity. Share his name.

I have a few questions... Does South Dakota have any interpreting agencies? A while back, the only one was the CSD monopoly, which should be well-versed in identifying certifications and skill level. Does South Dakota have any CDIs? The CCHI and CMI are not widely recognized in the Deaf community, and I don't think these certifications would be considered valid by many Deaf consumers.

Wow interesting.  Seems this man was active around my state in the 2010s.  A simple search of the name Christopher Itai Cardona leads to a 2017 article from an area college indicating he was deafened from the removal of a tumor on a nerve between his ear and brain stem.

Also found comments he left on a 2014 rulemaking order by the Missouri Commission of Deaf and Hard of Hearing where he gave these credentials:

&gt; Missouri Association of the Deaf (MoAD) Education Advocate, Greater Ozark Chapter (GOC) Education Chairperson, GOC Representative, Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Representative, MCO Representative

Hey, can you clarify what this man is doing?

All you’ve said he has entered deaf spaces while claiming he was deaf. 

What exactly is he doing? 

Is he a hearing person pretending to be deaf? Or actually deaf but doesn’t have the credentials that he claims to have. 

Is he taking an ASL teaching job? 

Is he making requests for interpreters? And after interpreters worked with him, they realized that he isn’t deaf (I’ve heard a story like this before)? 

Like I said, what exactly is he doing that is causing this concern? 

Context please.

This person is dangerous. Wow.

Thank you for this. I did not know about these registries.

HOW!?… was he even able to work at these jobs!? 
I mean, WHY wasn’t he given the RID testing!? 
  And WHY!?… did these places HIRE him without, apparently, Truly! checking out his credentials (not accepting his health care credentials, for instance)?! 
  Seems like They’re!…responsible, too, for slacking off- on their end! 
   Doesn’t seem like they were doing their job correctly, y’know!? And are partly to blame,

1olmy9j,deaf,deaf/hard of hearing medical student clinical accommodations,"Hi all, I'm a medical student who's hard of hearing (I wear bilateral hearing aids) and approaching clinical years.

If anyone is willing to share, what accommodations did you find useful during the clinical years of med school or in practice after med school? How did you communicate your accommodations to your supervisors? Accordingly, how receptive were your teammates to your accommodations?

Thank you!

[댓글]
Hi! I'm a Deaf MD student approaching graduation. Congrats on getting towards clinical years. The biggest accommodation for me was ASL interpretation. Still, a few others I found helpful were CART captioning for lectures and didactics, and a digital stethoscope that connected to my hearing aids (I'm partial to the EKO model because the app also gives a visual representation of the sound).

I always reached out to my rotation directors beforehand to introduce myself and my accommodation needs, as many people were working with a Deaf medical student/professional for the first time. If you are receiving services through the school they can also do this for you, but I preferred to be the one to introduce myself and my communication needs. I gave a few communication tips, like saying my name before addressing me, so I knew to pay attention (especially if there was crosstalk in the room), making sure they were facing me, and trying to avoid important conversations in noisy environments. I also found that table rounds were better for me than walking rounds, so I requested that.

Most of my teammates were curious and wanted to know what they could do to ensure my communication access. I, of course, had a few people over the years who were dismissive of my needs or who refused to change their behavior to make communication easier. Just being open and willing to answer questions in good faith, I found that most people wanted to help me be a member of the team. I also think it helped that I had interpreters because it gave my disability more gravity (not that it should've) and made people take it seriously. One of my mentors at my school has a CI but doesn't know ASL, and she sometimes has a harder time because her disability is ""invisible,"" so people forget about accommodating it.

The closest I've had to a similar situation was my cna clinicals. There wasn't really much accommodation. I used an automatic blood pressure cuff instead of the regular with a stethoscope  but I couldn't hear people well enough and got scared I'd miss understand something and someone would pay dearly. I guess idk what accommodations even exist for that. Also, my teacher made me feel like I was using my disability as an excuse becuz I couldn't do manual blood pressure so I made the 'patient' listen and tell me what they heard. She asked me in an accusing tone how I'd done it when she saw my paper work done. She shook her head as if that would not do, which makes sense but she didn't give me an alternative and treated me like I was milking my disability.

Im a health care assistant and I have always made it clear to employers and colleagues that they need to talk to my face so im able to lip read if I cant hear. I do think in that kind of job face to face has a huge impact.

helloo. i am a hoh emt and pre-nursing student. like another person suggested, the EKO is worth looking into for clinical. it's a little hit-or-miss with my particular aids but its soooo extremely helpful. i make sure i mute my aids, turn the volume up all the way and then i am able to do bp, ls, hr, etc. it takes ekgs as well but be wary since they are $600 or so and the app requires payment as well. worth it for deaf/hoh meds but i don't always suggest for hearing ppl. 

it'll take some time getting used to when interacting with other people but u'll build ur confidence as u go. just remember that ur disability is not a burden to anyone. we just need to try a little bit harder to get the same results as others. i think the ability to adapt and excel proves that we are stronger ;) good luck!! u got this!",2025-11-01 12:47:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1olmy9j/deafhard_of_hearing_medical_student_clinical/
1ol5qm1,deaf,Partially deaf and vocal control,"hi lovelies,

I was born deaf in my left ear and have been on this planet for three decades navigating large group settings, lip reading, irritatingly overpriced headphones, and bonus earplugs. however, one thing that continues to frustrate me is my vocal control. I do not possess much ability to regulate my volume when I am speaking, for all of my life I have been told that I am too quiet. However, an acceptable vocal level and a barely audible one sounds the same to me. On the off time I've been told I'm too loud, it also sounds the same to me. so my sound regulation takes a lot of concentration and focus on the feel of it in my throat (which is exhausting).

Does anyone else experience this?

would something like a CROS have any affect on vocal control?

Thank you !

[댓글]
I was born deaf in my right ear and am hard-of-hearing in my left. I also have trouble with how loud I am speaking. I got an Oticon Real 1 Minirite BiCros hearing aid about two years ago and that was when I realized how I was speaking. So I DO talk more quiet while I'm wearing it than I do without. If I try to force myself to talk at a reasonable level without my HAs in, I can't hear the sound of my own voice. So, without my HAs, I'm either too loud or too quiet. 

A couple of months ago, my youngest daughter (she's 32) was told by a coworker that she ""laughs too loud and talks too loud"" sometimes. She said: ""Oh, sorry. My mom is deaf and sometimes I forget that I don't have to be loud."" The person scoffed with a ""yeah, right"" before walking away. I asked her: ""Do you want me to come to your office and stand next to her desk and not respond to her when she demands to know who I am and what I'm doing there? Because I WILL!""

Your experience is pretty common for people who are late-deafened..  I lost one side much more quickly than the other so for a short time as young adult I was single sided deaf and my hearing was ""pretty good"" in my good ear.  Thinking back, I did sometimes have a problem with being  too quiet, though once I had lost most or all of the other side being too loud for the situation was more common. 

\&gt;  focus on the feel of it in my throat (which is exhausting).

When you speak, do you speak ""from the diaphragm""? If more often than not you're being too quiet, you can learn to better project your voice. A singing coach or speech pathologist should be able to help you learn the difference and then it's just practice. when you speak, you should be feeling it in your chest not so much in your throat. This makes me wonder if you're straining your vocal chords that you don't need to do. 

When it comes to being too loud, I don't have much advice, except try to remember start softly, then ""turn it up"" if necessary. It's usually less embarrassing  to be asked to be louder than to be less loud. 

I honestly don't think a CROS will help at all. However, this past year I got cochlear implants on both side after being deaf for a couple of decades and it has made a considerable difference. 

I

I've successfully replied ""Yeah, well, the other choice is you learning to sign and/or conduct all conversations via text, but I don't see you making the effort, so here we are - I'm happy either way.""

But I'm late deafened and onry sometimes :) 

Seriously, I have the same trouble and had to stop worrying about it.

We all deaf and hoh who can speak we have same iyas u are and not much u can do about it

Im hard of hearing and Im always being told im too loud. 🤷🏻 since forever.

I'm always loud. 
Growing up I had a lot of hoh  people in my family.
We all had to speak louder.So naturally everybody speaks loud. 

And now that i'm deaf I can't tell.

Hey! Also deaf in my left ear since I can remember. I don't have trouble talking too loud or too quiet. Perhaps it might be how used I am to amateur music and being a public speaker. Maybe it's also practice. When I was little I hated people who put on earphones with incredibly loud music yell at me because they couldn't hear themselves, so I just started practicing that. The fact that I couldn't hear myself speak didn't mean others couldn't. I'm trying to get a CROS but 3k seems unfairly priced to me.

It's possible it doesn't have anything to do with your deafness, you could be autistic, I am both autistic and deaf, and most people in the autistic community, have voice regulation issues.",2025-10-31 20:43:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ol5qm1/partially_deaf_and_vocal_control/
1ol112i,deaf,What should be the social etiquette in this situation?,"Hearing sign learner with beginner sign hanging out with a Deaf signer. We communicate in a mix of basic sign, gesture and writing.

If I happen to have an exchange with someone else while we're out together, should I, as much as able, be trying to sign simultaneously to include my friend? Should I sign after each part of the dialogue? Fill my friend in later? 

I'm basically talking small-talk situations like someone asking where I'm from (happens all the time due to my accent) or commenting on something going on around us. (Anything more complicated and I wouldn't have enough vocab to translate anyway except in writing later).

What if I'm just ordering from a cashier or something like that?

[댓글]
This seems like a pretty easy *ask them* situation... their comfort (and your ability) is what matters. But you aren't a terp, you aren't expected to be perfect/professional abt it.

I personally sign, as I feel it's rude to somewhat exclude those that can't hear.  I'm not a certified interpreter, but I have been signing for decades and help interpret at church (we have a few Deaf members).  If we're chatting after services (in sign) and someone comes by saying a hello or some sort of small talk, I'll sign what they said and what I'm saying, so it's a more inclusive environment.  For instance, a lady at church one Sunday was cheerfully mentioning that one of our Deaf members was talking up a storm, or something like that.  They wouldn't have known if I hadn't signed it.  And it made them chuckle, because it was friendly and kind of a way to try and connect in passing

I will never forget when I, mainstreamed oral, intermediate signer, waschastised by a deaf friend when she wasn't included in a convo I had at a store. She was very gentle but I never did that again. I felt terrible because being deaf myself, I should've known better. 
Do include your friend. In everything. Hearing friendsare always able to hear you even if you're talking to someone else. They can't.

Hello friend,  it’s true, it’s daunting to lose any ability. I would seek a therapist to talk to about this. The brain is a wonderful thing that can adapt and there is much beauty in the world to experience with or without hearing.

You mention in another comment that you're schi zophrenic. Surely that means you're engaged with the mental health system? I'd urge you to talk to your mental health professional about how you're coping with this.

I am going to be harsh here… 

I feel you. I know what it’s like. Lost mine at 33, overnight. It then stayed because of misdiagnosis.

But… you need to own it. Anger is fine, but who are you angry at? Something you can’t control? What’s the point? 

Own it. Channel the anger to something useful and something you can control. 

And I hope you have a good ENT and audiologist.

For most of my life, I have struggled with feelings of dissatisfaction towards the world. As I grew older, I learned to appreciate the value of self-acceptance. I believe you can also benefit from this realization.

I didn't learn ASL until I was around 21 years old, and finally, I felt a whole new world opened up! That was about 30 years ago. It's good for mental health for those losing their hearing because they can still communicate through sign language.

I feel your pain man. I’m hard of hearing in both ears and it’s already impossible to communicate with people effectively. Plus I am at risk of further hearing loss anytime there’s a horn by me or a door is slammed hard etc for me it sucks cause my old boss is why I lost my left ear. I think I already lost friends because I cant talk to them over discord anymore and my old job was getting progressively harder till I got fired and yeah.

Does being angry help? Is it beneficial at all? Or would it be more fun and enjoyable to try a different approach? There is professional support. Don’t get me wrong, of course it’s natural to become sad, but at the same time you miss out on absolutely everything fun and exiting in life. It’s only the hearing that doesn’t work, not your intelligence nor physical ability. You can do absolutely anything you like in life, besides hearing. The world is bigger than your hearing ability.

I am fully deaf in one ear and profoundly deaf in the other. I survive with a $900 Costco hearing aid, just one since I have no hearing in the other. The tinnitus is something I’ve always dealt with so I am used to it. I hear three sets of waves at times. You will be able to use a Cochlear Implant once the bad ear is no longer functioning… if that happens.

It may be good to see a counselor.  If you don't have insurance, there are often some that are income based with a sliding fee schedule.  Also, it may be a good idea to learn ASL.  I'm happy to provide a few resources to help you in doing so, if you'd like.  I'm sorry you're going through this.  Not the same, but I was hospitalized and diagnosed with POTS and had to be out of work for 7 weeks.  It's been life changing and has limited my abilities.  When an ability suddenly changes, it can be so very difficult.  I hope you are able to find some peace

Have you tried using your anger in ways that could be beneficial? Like working, music, art in general? Or join a group with others also suffering? See if you can find tools like meditation ect to help you be in the moment and catch your thoughts before they loop, the hearing issue is bad enough, the end al aspects only makes it worse, if you learn to be still and at leave in chaos you can do anything

the loss of a sense such as sight, sound, touch, smell etc is just that - A LOSS

of course you are upset! 

and when anyone experiences a loss, we need validation . 

sorry you have to deal with that

I know how you feel. Had the same issue, cholesteatoma first emerged when I was 13 then again at 19, both times things got more quiet after the removal. I’m 29 now, and a few years ago my left side started going as well, unsure if autoimmune or neuropathy or vaccine injury. But I’ve accepted that I’m likely to be completely deaf by 40.

It’s a transition. I’d suggest looking into learning sign language as a precaution, but it’s still a valuable skill even if you manage to maintain your hearing for a long time. I also use InnoCaption for my phone calls and Live Transcribe for in-person conversations, both of which have been a lifesaver. It’s going to take some adjustment but there’s ways to overcome it and reach the other side stronger

Grief in hearing loss is real.  I've lost my hearing and understand.

Where was your tumor? Did it embed in the nerve or not? If not, you might actually be a prime candidate for a cochlear implant.  I know that is a lot to process, but with the sheer grief you have, it may be something to consider.

I am part of ""Say What Club"" and a few other organizations for deaf and hard of hearing people.  SWC is the first place I felt my friend was normal.

... born deaf - not angry.  Just a touch sour about not having my adhd/autism bit's diagnosed or even recognized at least 30 years ago.  It would've saved me a shitload of trouble.

Have you considered getting a cochlear implant? I’ve been deaf for decades and recently got one and now I can hear again. It’s not perfect but it sure beats nothing. Especially when you have been used to sound. You will hear all the sounds faster again because you will remember them.

I promise you I’ve been through a similar thing, it’s not going completely deaf that gives me rage but all the unanswered questions I have

Honestly i get how frustrating it is. Just make people aware of which side is deaf or not. Its horrible but technology is pretty advanced right now. Have you had a hearing test?

I used to be at this stage and eventually accepted it, it’s a journey and your feelings are very valid.

The best thing you can do, now, is to accept that you have lost your hearing on your right side. Definitely look into hearing aids ( if you haven’t already ) and possibly Sign. It isn’t ideal, but you can’t be full of rage. It’s unhelpful - to you more than anyone... 

You’ll find a way, but as an idea, if you find yourself unable to hear someone just casually change sides….

1okkpgz,deaf,Lisa Rose Has Fallen,"Hi, r/deaf! Helen here.

A few weeks ago, I made a post in this community titled “NAD is in the Toilet.”

In that post, I highlighted the controversies that had begun to swirl within the Deaf community at the time.

Today, after weeks of mounting pressure from the community, Lisa Rose has submitted her resignation. NAD’s board has voted to accept it.

Apparently, Lisa Rose emailed her resignation letter to all NAD-affiliated state associations. The Washington State Association of the Deaf has since posted the letter publicly. I’ll copy and paste it in the comment section.

Vice President Stephanie Hakulin has now ascended to the president’s seat.

The board also voted not to accept the resignations of Milmaglyn Morales (Secretary) and Jimmy Peterson (Treasurer).

It’s still unclear whether Morales and Peterson have already communicated with the board and agreed to return, or if this was a symbolic move by the board, meaning they’ll now have to reach out to see if the two will, in fact, come back.

---

#So What’s Going On with Lisa Rose’s Resignation?

In short, nobody really knows except for the board members themselves.

Still, several things that have circulated widely in the community may give us some clues.

It seems that every single NAD board member who served under Lisa Rose’s tenure had a conflict and/or issue with her leadership as president.

I can’t tell whether these conflicts stem from fundamental disagreements about NAD’s direction as an organization, meaning the board objected to Lisa Rose’s ideas and leadership style, or whether this whole mess was personal.

In other words, either the disputes were about organizational vision… 

… or Lisa Rose is simply a petty and vindictive person who managed to alienate virtually every member of her board on a personal level.

Based on what’s been circulating around the community, Lisa Rose and the board have been locked in a grievance-filing war over the past two months. Apparently, Lisa filed grievances against many board members, and the board members, in turn, filed grievances against her.

As I said, I don’t know the exact nature of this grievance war. I don’t know if it was about one major issue, several internal disputes tied to NAD’s future, or if it all boiled down to personal immaturity. Basically, people too stubborn or petty to resolve things like adults.

By the way, I’m working on a few posts that will chronicle this entire saga. I had originally planned to post updates as the situation developed, but life, and the chaos happening on RID’s side, kept me busy. The interpreting field is closer to my heart than the broader Deaf community, so I prioritized covering RID’s recent developments over the last few weeks.

Now I’ve decided to take a different approach. Instead of “reporting” new developments as they happen, I’ll write a grand narrative that lays everything out for this community to read and reflect on.

Those posts are coming soon. They’ll take a deeper, more analytical dive into what really went down between Lisa Rose and the rest of the NAD board.

#My Thoughts…

I want to share the thoughts that have been running through my head lately.

You’re welcome to share your own in the comment section below.

##Transparency — A Thorn in the Deaf Community’s Butt

Many state-level associations had their board members publicly call for Lisa Rose’s resignation.

One of the most common themes in those statements was the lack of transparency from Lisa Rose in her role as NAD’s president.

This is a multi-layered issue and, admittedly, a frustrating one for me.

The deaf community is almost completely unified in its criticism of Lisa Rose for her lack of openness about what she was doing with the organization.

On that point, I fully agree.

There were far too many things Lisa Rose handled in secrecy or behind closed doors.

For instance, she presided over seven board member resignations (according to community discussions) and we still have no idea why they resigned.

And then there was the bizarre way she announced Kelby Brick as the sole candidate for NAD’s next permanent CEO. Her announcement was one of the strangest, most evasive public displays I’ve ever seen from a leader. She structured it to completely avoid any interaction or accountability with the community. It was as if she had committed a crime by announcing Kelby’s candidacy in the first place.

Then, out of nowhere, Kelby Brick was no longer in the running for the CEO position, and it appears NAD quietly pushed him out of his role as COO. All of that unfolded within just a few months with zero public explanation from Lisa Rose.

Even more baffling, Lisa Rose had roughly 30 state-level association boards calling for her resignation and she didn’t issue a single public response. Not one.

To make matters worse, according to Chris Haulmark and Justin Vollmar (both of whom have made significant social media content detailing Lisa Rose’s misconduct as NAD president), a secret committee was created under her leadership to review the grievances filed by board members.

They said that Lisa Rose and certain individuals within NAD told the board members who had filed grievances against her that they would be interviewed over Zoom by a mediator with the secret committee watching anonymously, without identifying themselves. Haulmark and Vollmar rightly pointed out that the board members had every right to know who was evaluating their grievances, and to look those committee members in the eye during such a serious process.

Phew.

That’s damning. It paints a picture of Lisa Rose running NAD more like a covert operation. Or, frankly, like an organized crime syndicate than a civil rights organization.

And to top it off, she defended her secrecy in her resignation letter, citing “confidentiality” as her justification (see the letter in the comments below).

However…

##Transparency is NOT a Lisa Rose Issue. It’s a Deaf Community Issue.

This issue deserves a full post and I actually have a draft written up. I’d like to post it someday.

For now, though, I’ll give a brief address.

While Lisa Rose made it clear that she believed in running NAD’s board in an anti-transparent manner, the truth is that this is a problem for the entire Deaf community.

This is exactly why I’ve turned my back on the Deaf community.

I’ve been severely burned out by my involvement with state-level associations because everyone acts like these non-profit organizations should be run as secret cabals with only a select, privileged few allowed to serve.

Let me give you some examples, sticking for now to what I’ve observed within NAD.

We had seven board member resignations. Only one person came forward publicly to explain their decision. And even then, it only illuminated a personal choice by this specific person, not anything about what Lisa Rose and the NAD board were actually doing with the organization.

While the Deaf community was shouting at Lisa Rose over these resignations, I was standing with me behind to her, looking straight at those seven former board members thinking, 

***“Well… if you resigned because there were serious concerns about how Lisa Rose was running this organization, you need to tell us!”***

Don’t give me the BS about NDA forms. If you really think these board members were prevented from telling the community why they resigned because of NDAs, you don’t understand the point of an NDA.

NDAs are meant to protect a reasonable level of privacy. No board member needs to disclose every messy detail from closed-door meetings. But if Lisa Rose engaged in serious and unacceptable misconduct as president, NDAs do not protect her from accountability. That kind of information needs to be public.

Here’s another example -

When Stephanie Hauklin announced that the board planned to hold a meeting during the National Leadership Training Conference, the community praised her “transparency.”

No. Just no.

Yes, I applaud her courage in going public to say the meeting would happen. But that’s not transparency. Everyone already knew the meeting was a move to remove Lisa Rose, yet Stephanie offered no explanation of why the board made this dramatic decision.

True transparency would have meant telling the community about the problems the board had with Lisa Rose, and that the meeting was intended to remove the president. It would also meant telling us all about their reasoning behind it. Stephanie did none of that. This is not what transparency looks like.

By my count, around 30 state-level associations called for Lisa Rose’s resignation. I can guarantee that most of them practice anti-transparent behavior at their own state level, despite demanding transparency from NAD.

Okay, that concludes my rant. I’ll likely post a thorough breakdown of the Deaf community’s institutionalized anti-transparent mentality sometime in the future.

##I Want to Acknowledge the “Intimidation” Issue

I’ve made it clear how I feel about transparency within our community.

But I also don’t want to dismiss everyone’s efforts in making Lisa Rose’s resignation happen, especially the NAD board.

I understand that there is a very real fear in this community. 

Anyone who dares to speak openly about the issues NAD is facing could face severe and life-altering threat of retaliation.

That is a form of intimidation. 

That threat is intimidating, and anyone in this position right now has every reason to be cautious.

I’m willing to acknowledge that these widespread fears of retaliation play a crucial role in why we are not seeing healthy transparency in our community.

In fact, I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone navigating this position.

But this is precisely why we need to have a serious conversation about these norms in our community.

And I do see glimmers of such a conversation beginning to take shape.

That gives me hope.

We must not neglect this. We must transform ourselves as a community by addressing this issue meaningfully. We must fight for a better future.

It’s time to stand up and push back against this form of intimidation.

---

##The Inspiring Collaboration

I’d like to close this post on a positive note.

NAD’s interim CEO, Bobbie Beth Scoggins, shocked the community by canceling the National Leadership Training Conference (NLTC).

Against my expectations, that sparked an incredible unification within our community.

I am honestly in awe that nearly everyone involved with the NLTC chose to rise above the cancellation and work together to make the current event happen.

This is the most unified I’ve ever seen our community.

Everyone involved in bringing the current event to life has my utmost praise.

I also suspect that some of these people may finally feel motivated to campaign for several of NAD’s vacant board positions.

If that happens, I truly believe we will witness a turning point. A real shift toward a better future for the organization.

I hope it does.

And hey, if any of you in Austin are reading this right now…

***clap clap clap***

You’ve made me proud with your collaborative efforts this week.

The one I use now is an osia 2 so it's a bone conduction rather then a cochlear. The hearing aid is only on my left and it works well enough for what it is. My hearing on my right is getting even worse especially in lower tones to the point I can't hear certain peoples voices because they are out of my hearing range. I struggle in most conversations and have to constantly ask people to repeat themselves. I am actively learning sign and am making good progress. I saw a thing recently that being hearing culturaly is primarily using speech and hearing to communicate. I have a hearing aid and can technically continue to communicate as I always have, with speech and hearing but since my hearing is getting worse that's becoming less of an option but I feel like because it's still an option and what I am actively doing I feel like I don't belong in the deaf community either",2025-10-31 02:57:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1okjlnp/i_dont_feel_like_i_belong/

1ojfwxq,deaf,Sound sensors that work for short sounds (not baby-cry monitors),"I've been looking for a bed-shaker system that will alert me to sounds. I've tried two or three models, but they all have this really frustrating and confusing wrinkle: the sound sensors that transmit to them only detect LONG sounds. They often seem to be marketed as ""baby cry sensors.""

That is, they'll detect most ringtones, but they won't detect a person *shouting* my name (which is just one syllable), even repeatedly. More worryingly, I found that the one I'm using currently won't even reliably detect a smoke detector going off, even when the smoke detector is right next to the sensor!! Presumably this is because the smoke detector beeps are very short and/or high-pitched. I have no idea why this ""long sounds only"" feature is a thing. Maybe they want to protect from waking you when a door slams? But hell, if it'd disturb a hearing person, I'd like it to disturb me!

Does anyone use a sound sensor/vibration system, and have you found one that is reliable for short sounds? ",2025-10-29 20:38:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ojfwxq/sound_sensors_that_work_for_short_sounds_not/

1oj1ie7,deaf,Has your hearing loss effected your relationships and how did you find a new normal?,"I (29) have been married 3 years, together 6. 

I was always a bit hard of hearing and we laughed it off as selective but this year i decided enough was enough because they were starting to get frustrated and I went to Specsavers and did a hearing test to discover moderate hearing loss up to 40dcb.

I was referred back to my GP due to my age and they in turn have referred me to a local ENT Specialist - but it's been 40 weeks and I still have no appointment.

My wife is getting angry with me because I miss things in normal conversation.

I ended up buying some cheap hearing aids from amazon but admittedly don't wear them as much as I should due to them being uncomfortable and a bit over stimulating, they make things louder but not clearer.

It's becoming a huge issue because she thinks I'm lying about not being able to hear her and I just don't know how to convince her it's not me being ignorant but I'm genuinely struggling. 

Today, so you can see where I am - We had an argument because apparently as I was going out last night to deal with our horses they asked me to put their horse in a specific rug that was a bit heavier. She was ill so I was on my own for the first time in a while.

In all honesty when I can't hear I will just smile and say OK because I don't want the argument of me asking for them to repeat themselves. 

I can believe they said it, I just know I didn't hear it so I don't remember the conversation, so now I'm a liar.

When we got out there together this morning, It devolved into this argument about me lying and how I can't be trusted with anything and that I should just keep away from our horses and let them do it all and ""When I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it"" and ""How can I ever be sick if you can't follow a simple instruction, I can't trust you"" - they want to go stay at their parents tonight and now cancel the IVF treatment we've begun and paid a lot of money for.

I feel like I'm failing in my marriage and not for lack of trying to do better. 

I have apologized about not hearing them, I even asked needed to redo our temperature schedule as if they want the horse in heavier outfits at different temperatures than we've had for the last 4 winters, i don't mind I just need to know because being angry at me for not hearing when they want to do something a bit different is also not the way to deal with this. I put the same rug on as the previous night because the weather was about the same.

I know it must be hard for our partners and so frustrating to not be heard but does anybody have tips on how i can make them feel heard when I can't hear?

I think iPhone has this feature. I remember a couple years ago it was really common for the flashlight to repeatedly turn on when you had a call.

To be honest I think her best option is a smart watch assuming she has a smart phone and can afford one. There are some cheaper models, although I'm not sure of the exact availability in India.

If she connects the watch to her phone then it will alert her wherever she is so long as the Bluetooth connection remains on

Landline or cellphone?

If cellphone, you can go to the accessibility menu and turn on flash when calling. You can also pair with a smart watch that will vibrate when you get calls.


If Landline you would need to buy a system like (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJZ1Z17T/ref=sspa_mw_detail_4?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9waG9uZV9kZXRhaWw) or hardwire in lights.",2025-10-29 10:19:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oj0qcf/want_a_device_wjich_visually_shows_incoming_calls/
1oixmaj,deaf,Nice encounter at store,"My gf is deaf. Full ASL use. I have been learning for the past year. Saw a guy at a store today and that he was deaf. So I introduced myself. Said my gf is deaf and it was nice to meet him. I told him my asl name, he spelled his but I dont know the alphabet. (Felt learning words was more helpful). He did show me his ASL name , anyways. It was just really cool. Only been able to use asl a couple times since being with my GF 

[댓글]
That’s awesome! 

Just so you know, ASL is one of those sign languages that rely a lot on fingerspelling, so I recommend you learning the alphabet. It’s typically one of the first things that beginners learn.

The ASL alphabet it one-handed.  Many signs are based off of ASL letter handshapes and fingerspelling is relied on somewhat heavily for some parts of conversations, so it may be a good idea to learn it!  Also, in ASL, you can count to 999 with 1 hand!  I'm happy you are learning and had this experience!  I hope you feel empowered to learn more and continue trying to break barriers to increase inclusion!

Way to go!! I don’t know ASL, but it’s great you’ve got the opportunity to practice - in public as well…! 

If I were you, I’d learn the alphabet. In BSL, it’s one of the first things you’re taught, if you go do an accredited course.

EDIT: Punctuation

That's great! I felt when I worked customer service, my Deaf customers always appreciated when I signed, too. I'm sure it's also appreciated the other way around! Just throwing some advice/food for thought in here, though (sorry for being another lecturer; just trying to give a new perspective): I learned a lot of signs before learning the alphabet and I ended up hating how painfully slow I was whenever I spelled something. I sometimes wish that, even though I'm faster now, I would have just bitten the bullet and learned the alphabet first. Plus, as someone else commented, ASL has so many times one needs to fingerspell, it's useful in the long run anyway.

That’s awesome! Not sure if you’re looking for advice but something that really helped me nail down fingerspelling was just randomly spelling words I saw during my day. Practicing moving between letters beyond just abc order was so helpful for me in connecting what hand shape goes with which letters, etc. Pass a Starbucks, read a fun word, or remember a movie title? Just practice spelling it!

I like to thank you very much for the suggestion",2025-10-29 06:54:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oixmaj/nice_encounter_at_store/

1oirdqc,deaf,What do you think of the interpreter ASL version on HBO Max?,"As a deaf person who wears a cochlear implant, I love watching movies with an ASL version. What is your thoughts? 

[댓글]
Be more specific. HBO has a few movies and shows that are interpreted. 

Overall, they’re good. HBO hires Deaf actors with a team to make sure the interpretation is correct. The interpreter window could be bigger, but that’s another topic will be an adjustable setting in a few years. 

Personally, I don’t have an HBO subscription. I use SignUp with Disney instead. I wish Disney and Netflix would bake in the ASL version so I could use it when streaming on my PlayStation.

I don't know enough ASL to be able to follow the interpreter, but when I watch the movie, I will watch the ASL version because I read somewhere (probably around here on the Reddit) that if there are enough views, they'll keep doing it. And despite not being fluent enough, I do think watching it that way helps my brain retain ASL things a little more.

I loved Barbie with ASL. There were three different sign names for the Barbies: the main character Barbie, Weird Barbie, and a generic one for all other Barbies.

However, Ken didn't get a sign name, just finger spelling, lmao! 

But, I was super disappointed that she disappeared during the What Was I Made For scene towards the end. I feel like the lyrics to Billie Eilish's song were meaningful to the scene, and I was confused that this song wasn't interpreted while the earlier ones were.

The Superman one is phenomenal. I generally prefer to just read captions but the way the Superman DI made the sound effects come to life… wow.

I like it. Some are better done than others. But love it's being made and will keep supporting!

Hi!! I got one on my right side in 2016 and don't wear anything on my left. I'd say it's good enough: I can understand speech (provided it fits the criteria: no loud background noise, no mumbling, room to lipread etc) and hear relatively well with it on. The one thing that trips me up is I cannot determine where sound is coming from. If someone calls my name, I'll spin around in a circle looking for the source of the noise: I'm never able to pinpoint ""ah it's coming from the right, it's coming from that crowd over there"". I use the roger on as well; I plug it into my pc to act as headphones which works wonders but it does mean that I'm completely cut off from the outside world. If someone had bilateral implants I assume they could tune one to the roger on and leave the other one picking up external noise, but with one it's kind of all or nothing if you tune into bluetooth or the roger on. It does make me jump a lot when someone knocks loudly on my bedroom door when I cannot hear anything around me.

I am pretty deaf in both ears but just have one CI now. I could hear everything as soon as the CI was connected. I still use a hearing aid on the other ear though it’s not very effective. I can’t hear well in every situation. My friends are old and can’t put any power to their voices. Many are in nursing homes or independent living - bad acoustics. I can’t hear music - it’s like static. I use transcribe app to ‘hear’ lectures or meetings but it’s not always right.  I use an alarm clock with a paddle under my mattress to wake me since CI can’t be worn while I’m sleeping.",2025-10-28 17:15:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oifd66/cochlear_implant_for_singlesided_deafness/

You feel like something is missing because you just took part of the game away that you are used to, and so your experience of the game feels like you are missing out on something, because you are focussed on what is missing.


None of those games need sound. Plenty of hearing people play multi player games without voice chat bc randoms on the internet are often awful anyway. 


If you really wanna learn how Deaf gamers play, search for Deaf gamers on whatever social media platform you use, and follow a bunch of Deaf content creators. Same goes for next time you want to learn about someone different from you. It's great you wanna understand other people's experiences, but listening to other people who want to tell you about it is gonna be way more effective 💚

One time me (hearing) and a bunch of (hearing) people played with one Deaf and one person enforced that you had to type in the chat to deduce who they thought it was. It made the game inclusive, because otherwise my Deaf friend was just guessing with no info. 

Some games don't require talking.

Not related to the games you've mentioned but I know there's a discord WoW Deaf/HoH guild

Fortnite has visual indicators for gunfire and footsteps. I know it's not a solution for the games you've listed but I've found it very accessible. Most games made after 2010 will have a ping wheel you can use for tactical communication

I avoid them, but for different reasons than hearing stuff. Pvp games just IMO aren't that fun. 

They tend to be toxic, and they don't break up people by skill up well enough. Like, I have a job and a kid, I can't spend 23 hours a day practicing PVP, so instead I would log on and immediately get shredded by high level players that grief in low level brackets. 

If I play multiple titles, IMO I've had alot more fun with PVE games. Even if the CPU opponents cheat or get way too strong, atleast it's a consistent known amount, not some player with 4,000 hours griefing the noob zone.",2025-10-28 11:52:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1oi78u5/how_do_you_enjoy_playing_multiplayer_games/
1ohu3kj,deaf,Is this discrimination?,"So I had an interview call scheduled with a company. When they called, I was using **VRS (Video Relay Service)** — it’s a service that lets Deaf or hard-of-hearing people communicate with hearing individuals through an interpreter.

The moment the recruiter realized it was through VRS, they hung up. I tried explaining in the chat that it was an interpreter relaying my voice and responses, but after that, they never called back or responded to my messages.

I wasn’t rude or anything — just trying to go through a normal interview process. It honestly felt like they ghosted me the moment they found out about the interpreter.

Would this be considered **discrimination under ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**, or is there some other explanation I’m missing?

[댓글]
Aside from your question... did you meet through Zoom or how did you have a chat with them?

At the very least, I would write a nice letter or email to the HR department explaining your experience, that you would like to request the reasonable accommodation of using VRS during the interview, that you suspect they may have mistakenly thought it was AI or something similar, and that you are looking forward to having an interview.

Yes. You can report it online here: https://www.ada.gov/file-a-complaint/

Definitely report it to the ada as a violation. Sure, they’ll make up some wackadoodle story about tech difficulties, and that the position has been filled. But nothing changes if nothing changes.

Personally I like to call these companies out by letting them know what they did is wrong. I’m sure it wasn’t malicious, but at least this way they will know

Technically, yes, it’s discrimination. Short of hiring a lawyer out of your pocket, there isn’t too much to be done. Even before the shutdown and this administration, the department of justice wouldn’t do anything for a complaint like this. 

From the recruiter’s perspective, they’ve been inundated with AI chat bots for phone and video interviews. So as soon as they think there’s something off about the interview, they’ll cut it off.

Report it

You want to contact the EEOC (even though there's a shutdown there are, for now still people handling this kind of thing) The EEOC is the federal agency responsible for enforcing the employment provisions of the ADA.. I would contact legal advice before sending anything to anyone connected with the company. 

This sounds like discrimination, seek legal advice, You probably don't want to outright accuse them, see if they'll make it right. They might know they did wrong.

You can waste your time and report it, this administration doesn't care, they are already looking to get rid of the ADA as well as the civil Rights act. A good attorney might get their attention, but that's money that would come out of your pocket. Personally, I would just name drop the company as discriminatory, and let everyone you know, know about it. Word of mouth is more powerful than any attorney.

Possibly but err on the side of caution. Email them cc’ing HR or someone above them about the “technical issue” the interviewer experienced and discuss rescheduling.  If they give you a fair shot then great, if they double down on you using AI or whatever they think it is then you have some more ammo. 

I always prefer to assume discrimination is due to stupidity rather than malice. Sometimes people panic and make dumb mistakes.  Like others have said, there is no real case to follow up on these days you aren’t going to get a million dollar payday out of this experience.

I'm sorry but that is definitely discrimination. That wasn't fair to you.

There’s a bit of technical issues and difficulties involved in using other apps and stuff doing interviews. An interviewer could easily be running through doing 4 dozen interviews where some or any difficulty could just easily result in moving on. I think deciphering between that and actual discrimination is where you’re currently at. I’d email them about rescheduling and base my conclusion off that.",2025-10-27 23:30:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ohu3kj/is_this_discrimination/
1ohikdw,deaf,Are there dating taboos in the Deaf community?,"I have been socializing with my local ( 2-3 hour driving radius from where I live) Deaf Community. Including volunteering at the school of the Deaf. I have meet so many friends and I really enjoy the openness and directness of the culture. But something thats caught me of guard is the lack of dating taboos. If I am honest I also don’t have the best read on these things I grew up in an world at 22 I started to learn about  “Relationship and personal connection dynamics deemed healthy and respectful for society” while receiving therapy so I could Identify if things are toxic. But so many relationships in the Deaf community seem to break the rules I am taught. I am starting to think I followed these rules so strictly that it’s negatively impacting how show up to my friendships. ( More like I am filled with anxiety worried about safety.)

So If its not offensive I am going to list them here and there is no judgement. All of these “taboos” arent really that much of a taboo in other non American cultures. I just want a better understanding of things if normal so I can communicate my worries as if I would to my hearing friends.

- Age Gaps: I am often seeing huge Age Gaps in the Deaf Community. Personally, I have had men almost twice my age,( I am 29) try to date me. Serval men 15 years old, and a few men 10 years older. Additionally, I had a Deaf man ( my age )in a secret relationship with my friend who is also Deaf and 20 years older while maintaining a friendship with her CODA son who is 23.  I have seen 21 year old Deaf girl with a 35 year old Deaf man. And I have seen more than that. But it’s just surprising how much I see it. When I dated someone 10 years old during my time in therapy it was a huge problem with all of my friends and mental health support. If I am honest it was one of my better relationships. 

- Communication: I was on facetime with one friend signing up a storm when our other mutual Deaf friend text us that “ Sex Experience enjoyed” with serval happy/horny and my favorite explosion memes. Then sent us both real photos of them post sex cuddling. I literally did a spit take. Another direct communication shock was some of my Deaf guy friends saw me checking out a hearing bartender who was really friendly and looked curious about the 5 people signing in a bar randomly on a Thursday night. So my ‘friend’( he actually is my ASL teacher who accidentally came in with his one friend who I adore and bumped into me and my Deaf and HoH friend) proceeded to wave over the waiter so I can interpret a conversation so I can find reasons to talk to him. Then when that was done my ‘friend’ informed with confidence that even though the man is hot he didn’t look like he was into me. I clear deserved better which was his opinions. My hearing friends would have been so worried about all of this.

-Dating your old Teachers: The 21 year old Deaf girl and the 35 year old Deaf man met when she was still a student. They didn’t start dating recently until she became a coach for a sports team at the School of the Deaf where the man works. They both seem happy and from me and the girl talking she seems comfortable with everything. Deaf interpreter teacher is now dating a former Deaf Interpreter Student they have a 7 year age gap with her being older. They announced their relationship and couple weeks after she graduated the program. More recently other ASL students and Deaf friends have informed me that they believe my teacher has a crush on me. If I am honest I am starting to see it too. I feel comfortable and I don’t feel disrespected there is a 15 year age gap. Honestly, I am not sure how to react but he has apparently been telling his other ASL students all about my pet cat, about us bumping into each other at Deaf events and us having drinks together ( Deaf event in Bar invited by other Deaf friends we just drink in a room together). He has even told other club officers that I am pretty and I walk like a princess. Recently he has brought up conversations asking how I feel about dating older men, and about dating teachers. He wants to know my opinion for his ‘friends’. But its caused other students to worry about my safety, and my Deaf friend saying he thinks we should date which I don’t see myself doing unless he wasn’t my teach anymore and I knew him more as friends. Though we do seem to know a lot of each other and got close after some chaos in the spring semester. 

I am not convince about my teacher likes me, but I tend to be oblivious about social things. But it seems like it’s normal in our local deaf community.  It’s just been confusing, and I am the only ASL student I known from our program who got connected so fast to our local community.  Everyone I listed looks like they have happy healthy relations based on the conversations I have had. Few of the examples are really good friends of mine I talk to almost once a week now. I just find myself not knowing how to navigate these things. 

Thanks for any and all commentary.

It's similar to the gay community - because you have a smaller pool of available dates, people bend rules. Sometimes that's fine, sometimes it's not.

For example, age gaps. There is a difference between someone who happens to meet someone younger but well-settled and hit it off, vs someone who often goes for young, naive people without resources/support.

I would be very, very careful about dating a teacher or former teacher, and even if you're both adults, he shouldn't be expressing interest while you're a student, that is a bad sign.

There’s a lot to address here. One of the things other people haven’t touched on is the “deaf bluntness”. It gets used as a testing grounds for sexual permissiveness. If someone is texting you pictures after sex, while talking about the sex, that’s not Deaf culture. That’s seeing what they can get away with. The next step is probably naked pictures or invitations to join. 
    Your 21 year old friend is probably ok with the relationship now, but years from now will likely not be ok with how it played out. Dating current/former students is a huge no no. Everyone who works at Deaf schools has to go through trainings about this. 
    This next bit is not to be rude, but, if it’s people in the Deaf community that are spending a lot of their time with people new to sign and the community, they likely have already been rejected by their local Deaf community. They’re probably using this space as “hunting grounds” for the next young person to come along. Stay safe, be vigilant, and good luck!

I grew up at a Deaf residential school where men would groom girls because they believed it was acceptable. No one recognized how wrong it was. As a result, it leads to a lack of boundaries and morals. 

Some Deaf staff members were caught having sex with students at school. None of them were reported or fired but they were quietly let go to protect their reputations. They repeat the same patterns at a different school.

Regarding the part about dating Deaf teachers, they know it's off-limits but toxic traits in the Deaf community often allow it to happen. It has continued all these years because no one questioned it.

Lots of news!!! I must admit I enjoy news.

I can't speak for the Deaf community but personally almost all of those things you described I am comfortable with. I'm also gay.

HOWEVER, if you feel uncomfortable in general, it may be wise to set some boundaries or express that you aren't interested. Take some inspiration from your new friends and be blunt! 

And maybe drinking and/or dating right now aren't healthy for you? I would say slow down, cowboy. You probably don't need to go drinking in bars right now, and don't need to be dating anyone within the local community yet. Are there coffee meetups you can go to for right now? You can always rejoin the bar environment later when/if you feel comfortable.

Lip reading is special kink for us

There's a lot to unpack in this.

Due to size and cultural differences, it can sometimes be hard even for people with the best of intentions to maintain appropriate boundaries. Then you add in people who are fuzzy about what they are or don't care much about that and it can be a whole mess.

The Deaf community also has many well ""missing stairs"" in it. The fact that almost everyone steps over and around them out of fear or habit and then looks so shocked when someone gets injured by one does not make the whole thing fine.

There's also a huge thing developmentally different when it comes to, say, a 40 year old dating a 20 year versus a 40yo dating a 60yo, despite the number of years apart being the same.

Also, beware of the Deaf man that not only goes for much younger but goes for hearing. That warrants not only the question what BS women his age won't tolerate from him that he prefers to state as a personal preference for younger women... it also should make any hearing woman look into why Deaf women aren't knocking down this dude's door, particularly when there aren't a lot of options for Deaf who specifically prefer Deaf partners, and only somewhat more for Deaf who just want someone who can sign.

Also, if an older Deaf woman or a gay guy (or in some cases even straight guys who are commenting too much they have a daughter around your age) tries to warn you off some dude, trust them. There's no net gain for them in a community where issues with boundaries often gets normalized and doing that often gets mislabeled ""negativity"".

Your teacher knows he isn't supposed to be going for a student. It's in his handbook. Most colleges not only include this but do so in an unequivocal manner. I know many Deaf professors who don't need this clarification. I would actually argue that most Deaf who are in academia who have specialized degrees and credentialing know very well but then some still *choose* to act inappropriately. It is very hard to get through a hearing system without becoming cognizant that the Deaf community has some issues in this area. I don't know why this is but usually it's late Deaf and Deaf of Deaf who I see saying something looks very wrong when it does... though I suspect better boundaries may be the result of more access to incidental learning.

Ok, deaf people are very blunt and open with each other including sex talk. It’s normal. As for age gaps, could it be because the dating pool is very small?",2025-10-27 16:08:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ohikdw/are_there_dating_taboos_in_the_deaf_community/

See am audiologist or ENT. You might be able to get into a an audiologist quicker but they are more limited in their care options and might refer you to an ENT where as an ENT might be harder to see and can have more treatment options but will likely have an audiologist in house you can see for diagnostic work.

Do you have an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist? If so, call to request a same or next-day appointment. If you don’t have an ENT, go to your primary care physician for an exam and a referral to an ENT. I hope you’ll soon get some relief.

1ohey44,deaf,Deaf/HOH Marriage,"Do you think two deaf/hoh people can marry and live happily like normal hearing couple? I think for deaf people have many challenges from getting job to living lavish life unless you have rich parents?  In India there is still lack of accomadation and high paying jobs for deaf so how deaf/hoh couple can live life in harmony and lavishly especially in India?

[댓글]
Any marriage can either work or fail, it doesn't matter whether you are hearing or deaf or poor or rich.


Good communication is what counts in every relationship.

I’m in the US. I’m deaf and was married to my deaf husband for over 20 years before he passed. We both had good jobs a kids. Not sure how things work in India. Communication is important.  Of course some marriages succeed and others fail.

Deaf community has one of the world’s highest rates of intermarriage. So yes it’s extremely common for two deaf people to marry and have lovely deaf children who grow up as highly fluent signers and go to university and have well paying jobs. 

Sign language is passed from generation to generation through deaf parents with deaf children.  These native deaf signers are about 10% of our community and are the core of our language and community. The other 90% of deaf signers learn signing later in life. Sometimes much later (like me). But it’s never too late to learn! 

The other key point is of the children of deaf signing parents, about 10% are deaf and 90% are hearing.  These hearing children have sign language as their first language and their mother language. They should have the right to go to sign-medium school if it is what they want.  

This is not just my view, it is the view of the United Nations Children’s Commissioner. I watched him say this in a presentation at the Congress of the World Federation of the Deaf. I think this was in Spain a few years ago.

I used to be deaf, and am now HoH.

I have been in a relationship with the LOUDEST hearing person on the planet for a solid 25 years.

It works. We even produced loud kids, lol.

Good question. There are deaf and hard of hearing marriages in Hungary too. I heard that if someone has a job, then it is good. But they get paid little. If someone does not have a job, then their parents and relatives secretly give them money for support. And the commentators are right that only communication is important. So it does not matter if they are poor, rich, small, big, whatever. It sounds sad that they are making a big mistake. Because it is pure greed, they are just in the friend zone. I know it is a hard life. Take care you all.

Youre overthinking this. Love is love. If you two people want to make it work, it will.

Love and respect along with good communication is the key to a successful marriage. You'll have some challenges like any other married couple. However it will take a lot of effort on both you and your mate to make it work. Don't know what you mean by lavish or if you just mean being able to take care of the needs of your family and having a nice comfortable home; that will be up to you to decide. Be willing to work hard and if opportunities are available try to develop new skills. Eventually, you will reach your goal in caring for your family adequately.

I’m in a happy marriage. But I am the only one with hearing loss. Partners learn tons of ways to communicate besides speaking and being able to communicate a plethora of ways just becomes natural. Therefore I see no reason two deaf people wouldn’t be just as happy. I also work and have worked multiple jobs. I have no special accommodations outside of my hearing aids. Is it tough sometimes? Sure but is it manageable? Absolutely. You can still have a career and be damn good at your job without your ears.",2025-10-27 13:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ohey44/deafhoh_marriage/
1oh6md2,deaf,Hearing graphic designer – is curating Deaf stories/history appropriate?,"Hi everyone!

I'm a hearing graphic designer considering a book project that would curate existing Deaf stories, history, and art – collecting already-published work (with full credit/permissions) and designing it to highlight those voices through thoughtful typography and layout. This is not a commercial project.

But I want to check first: as a hearing person, does this feel like overstepping? My role would be purely curatorial/design – arranging existing voices, not speaking for anyone. I'm totally open to hearing ""this isn't your project to do"" if that's the consensus.

Any perspective is appreciated. Thanks :)

[댓글]
Are you planning on collaborating with Deaf writers, artists, and graphic designers? The project itself isn’t an issue for me, but deaf and hard of hearing people don’t get as many opportunities as hearing people do, so I’d like to see hearing people who have access to resources and opportunities to create deaf-related projects to collaborate and share with deaf and hard of hearing people, so DHH people get to have the same access. Let them take the lead and make sure they’re properly credited. That’s how you can really help the DHH community.

If you're collaborating with a Deaf creator, you can ask them

Deaf graphic designer and bookbinder here... 

If you're doing layout design for your own personal collection, I don't see a conflict of interest. 

If it's something that's going to go on display somewhere, or a limited run printing, I'd highly recommend collaborating with other deaf artists, illustrators, and authors for feedback and including their bodies of work with your layout design. While it is your layout design and thoughtful interpretation, the copy is another's body of work... Some of them may have a particular way they wish for their work to be portrayed. I think with working in graphic design industry you get a fairly decent understanding of copyright and how much creative freedom you have.  However, I don't really see an issue with you publishing either. While many may tout ""leave deaf people to do deaf things"".... I don't always see the efforts being made to do so. So... It is what it is. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Not an ideal solution, but does your phone have auto captions, could be worth turning off the school ones and using those? The quality will be awful, but if you are using them as a boost to your hearing rather than from scratch might work?

1ogz7bd,deaf,Blind person looking for advice on how to communicate with someone deaf,"Hello, everyone I am of hearing, but I am vision-impaired, and am looking for advice on how to communicate with hard-of-hearing family. I'm a 34y/o adult living with their grandfather. I wanted some advice on how to communicate with him. Aside from being deaf, he doesn't really speak much English and I don't understand any Taiwanese (especially not the traditional writing system, learning to read written Chinese as a Westerner is um...... really hard and blindness makes it harder). Communication between us breaks down frequently. He speaks some English, but there's a lot of ""You should do THIS"" where I have no idea what the word ""this"" refers to because he's usually demonstrating something.  Likewise, he may tell me to go ""over there"" and I won't know where ""there"" is (I'd assume he's gesturing but I can't see it). I often ask him to be more specific, but he usually just keeps talking (I'd assume he doesn't hear me).

Sometimes I write him notes on my phone's AAC app with my hardware keyboard (I have selective mutism). This helps but it's not perfect. I wanted advice. I did try contacting my state's department of the deafblind about my speech impediment before I got comfortable with AAC, they said there were no classes in Proctile in the state and the best I could do is take an ASL class at the local community college and get someone to sign into my hand. My local community college offers ASL class over zoom which I can't see, and we can't afford college anyway (I'm also unsure if he's up to learning a new language at age 90). I'm unsure what else to do to ease communication. Between my blindness, his deafness, and language/cultural barriers it's just hard. What ideas does the Deaf community have for us?

  
Sorry if I seem inconsiderate, I'm honestly trying my best to be respectful. I just feel confused and don't know how to approach him.

[댓글]
A lot of people in my family are hard of hearing but don't know any sign language, they also have no interest in learning. On that side of the family, the solution is hearing aids, yelling, and a lot of repeating ourselves. If you have a communication system on your phone, it may not be loud enough for him to hear it very well. I have a speaker that is square and can fit into a large cargo pocket that is loud enough for my family to hear on maximum if it's up to their ears.

 
I don't know how to get it into his head that you can't see, maybe there is a subreddit where people know more about being blind and living with sighted people?

You are 100% not inconsiderate at all, and honestly you’re both trying very hard. It’s a pretty complicated situation, but it’s not one I haven’t seen before.

Check if there’s a Deaf/DeafBlind community active near you, tactile sign would be the best - even small words - but in these situations it’s pretty tough. You can try making some home tactile signs, these are simply gestures you make up on your own to associate things, you can base it off a signed language or basic movements. There’s a lot of resources for ASL online (you don’t have to teach him the corresponding English word, you can substitute the English meaning for Taiwanese, ASL is its own individual complex language and has little in common with English) 

I’ve known a small amount of elders who learn some sign, but they’ve lived their whole lives speaking, it’s what they’re familiar with and want to continue doing. 

I could suggest tactile cards, tactile cues, and above all else try and find community support. Even though they may not offer classes nearby, there may still be DeafBlind or others with similar situations near you. 

My friends had luck with tactile cues with routines. For example, if he says “this” often, you can ask him to try placing the object in your hand or tapping it against your hand so you know what “this” means. You might say, “Please touch my hand with it.” He might get used to that over time. Keeping a similar routine going helps a ton, as you have to communicate less, but sometimes it just can’t be avoided. 

Additionally keep and label these things together, food, tools, appliances etc. 
Keep a list of common items and actions in english and Taiwanese in your notes app or on communication cards.

I have a friend who communicates through communication cards with braille and images with a relative, aka a card with braille “bathroom” and an image of a toilet with writing. Some people make these themselves, some use tactile strips or other things if they don’t use braille. You can buy them online - if you can’t find someone specifically you can buy Taiwanese communication cards and ask someone to add braille or tactile strips to them.

Is there anyone in your life that can explain the extent of your blindness to him in his native language? Right now it seems like the biggest hurdle to overcome is him understanding that.

What makes you qualified to talk to college professors about this? Why not ask the Deaf population on campus?

I was back at university in 2023, and it was the best time of my life due to the access. I loved it. I felt spoiled, because everything was so easy and smooth, and I had top grades. 

I used CART for lectures and digital group work, and interpreters as soon as something was more interactive. I also had interpreters for a lunch where we were supposed to get to know our student work group. I did have more takers, but that worked so-so. CART is smooth for me who has the spoken language as my first language, and the big pro is that you’re not locked to the screen so much. It is possible to glance at PowerPoints, lectures and write something brief down and still follow the text. The big pro with the interpreters is that they are so much more flexible. CART can be fast if you’re lucky, but the communication is faster and smoother with an interpreter. You can move around and improvise, which you can’t with CART. In digital meetings, I prefer text, since it doesn’t block so much screen space.

i currently dont have hearing aids, so the biggest access issue i have in college right now is my lecturers not writing down/uploading online all of the necessary information needed for class and instead relying on group conversation. This is especially difficult for me because we personally have a group focused classroom, computers around the walls with a big table in the middle. So there is no ""front"" of the class for me to sit at to hear better from, as the lecturers walk all around the room. Voice to text has been helpful but relies on my phone having enough battery, and isnt always accurate. Online communication to the lecturers through microsoft teams  has been wonderful and is the most helpful.

Edit: the group focused layout of the class also means that i face away from all of the people when using the computer, i try to not use the computers if i can help it as it means im almost unreachable if im focused or in a louder class. I have a tablet with a keyboard case i use instead while sitting at the middle table, that i also use for voice to text, for other people personal laptops would be helpful",2025-10-26 02:40:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1og9m9x/best_practice_communication_access_college/

I was considering buying the AirPods Pro 3 (due to the possibility of hearing aid capability) for a deaf friend with moderate hearing loss but was curious if it will be more reasonable to get headphones instead for a better music listening experience. I unfortunately cannot ask because I’d like for it to be a surprise.
Does anyone have any experience with either?
Thank you!

You need to talk to your friend and find out what kind of setup they have. Depending on the nature of their hearing loss, streaming directly to their hearing aids will likely be the best way to go.


Not asking isn't really an option. 


Once upon a time I got an iPod shuffle as a gift. It was horrible because I had to pretend to be thankful and grateful (it was a gift from work, probably paid for with my supervisor's own money) but it was worthless to me. I was beyond being able to enjoy music anymore and only had the use of one ear anyway. 


I don't know your friend so I can't be sure how they'll react. Just don't be hurt if they either don't accept your gift or sell it on eBay.

My hearing aids have Bluetooth. I'm able to stream my music directly from them, so headphones aren't something I use anymore.  

I would try to ask the friend versus guessing as an assumption that could make things awkward. Or maybe get them a gift card so they can decide?

I wouldn't buy it this far ahead of you're doing I as a surprise. I would buy it with cash (so that any refund is cash) closer to Christmas and then gift it to them with the original receipt along with the gift so they can take it back for cash (and tell them that's what you gave it to them for) they can use for something they will use without being made to ask you if you get it wrong. That way if you don't get the right thing for them (which is so risky/hard to guess correctly) they can get all the money back without feeling bad and, say, buy the connection accessories from their audiologist if they don't have newer hearing aids with Bluetooth or they can get a haptic strap instead or just decide that they don't like music as much as you think they do and want something else.

But the Deaf and hard of hard people I know who can listen to music without needing hearing aids or cochlear implants wear either AirPods or headphones. I think it’s personal preference, like one isn’t necessarily better than the other for the majority of people.

It's going to depend on ypur friends specific hearing loss. 
They may be able to use airpods, but they might not. I do think headphones are the safest option though, so long as they are the ones that cover the entire ear so you can wear hearing aids at the same time.

My go to for music (if im not just streaming to my hesring aids) is the Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2. Thats because they have sensory bass and I can adjust them to fit over my hearing aids. I do have smaller ears so it might be a tough fit to make work for someone with larger ears to listen without hearing aid feedback but I'm sure it can be done.

My partner has moderate hearing loss and we couldn’t afford the cost of going private for hearing aids (£1800) and the NHS is looking at a 15 month wait for pretty rubbish ones. They are currently using the AirPods Pro 2 as hearing aids and it has been literally life changing. Obviously it will depend on individual circumstances but has been brilliant for us.

Has your friend given you any indication that this is a gift they would find value in receiving?

1og57ww,deaf,reunion TV show,"I am watching Reunion and am already triggered just 5 min into the show. seriously how can people just continue to just talk away after they know the OP is Deaf and cannot understand them. where is accountability.

Anyone else watch this? I didn’t even know about it. It is on Paramount.

I love the topic and actors in Reunion. I love the title-card they have for it which is the sign SORRY spreading blood in a circle on his T-Shirt.

I ***loath*** the camerawork.

I guess that is just my personal bugbear because it seems to me like half of the bloody shots cut off the signers' signing. So many close-up shots and shakey cam. Makes me feel tired, kinda nauseous and angry to watch it.

It's extra annoying because this was supposed to be a series by and for Deaf folks as well as the hearing audience. I can almost forgive it if all you have is one Deaf/signing character - but when half your cast is it feels so much worse. Is it not a basic tenet of film and TV to actually catch what the actors are saying?

Couldn't carry on watching it after an episode. Plus I don't really like watching stuff that makes me miserable. Still a great piece of telly that I hope gets seen by many! Shame I can't stand this one aspect.

Also it's on the Beeb, and thus the i-Player for Brits :)

&gt; seriously how can people just continue to just talk away after they know the OP is Deaf and cannot understand them. where is accountability.


You don't have this problem with your own hearing family? You're fortunate. 


I'll give this show a try, but if it pisses me off I'll stop watching it. If I want to be angry at the TV content I have the religious channel over the air for free.",2025-10-25 23:00:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1og57ww/reunion_tv_show/
1ofx1ux,deaf,Deaf Community in Bangkok,"We are visiting Bangkok soon and are wondering if there is a deaf (ASL) community there?  My son is HOH/Thai-American and it’s also for additional research in case we move there as a family.

[댓글]
You will be glad to know that Thai Sign Language is a descendant of ASL, so once you get plugged in to the local deaf community, your son should feel completely at home (I'm assuming he's a fluent ASL user).

It's understandable you're looking into this for your son and for the possibility of a family move. Bangkok certainly has a deaf community, but it's important to know that the primary sign language used there is Thai Sign Language (TSL), which is distinct from ASL. While your son being Thai-American could be a wonderful bridge culturally, the language difference in signing is a key aspect to consider. You might encounter some ASL users, especially among younger people or those with international experience, but TSL is the prevailing sign language. For a deeper understanding and to potentially connect with the local deaf community, reaching out to organizations like the National Association of the Deaf in Thailand or exploring universities with programs in special education or linguistics can often provide valuable contacts and insights into local resources and social groups. During your visit, if you're keen to explore the city and gain broader insights into various aspects of local life and culture, which could certainly aid your research into what living there might be like, a reliable platform for finding diverse tours and activities, where you can often connect with local guides for more personalized experiences, is [Viator](https://vi.me/XVT6G). Sometimes a private local guide, especially one you brief on your family's unique interests and goals, can offer a more nuanced perspective on local community structures or even help point you towards relevant local resources that might not be obvious to a typical visitor. Exploring the city in this way can really help you get a feel for the environment and potential support systems should you decide to relocate.",2025-10-25 17:16:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ofx1ux/deaf_community_in_bangkok/
1ofpowq,deaf,My daughter is deaf and she’s inconsolable because she can’t join the military,"I’m not deaf myself, just the parent of a deaf kid so my apologies if this post is not allowed here. But my daughter is genuinely obsessed with everything related to the military, she has been since she was six. If I went into how all encompassing this obsession is it would take me forever, but it definitely won’t pass.. she is 16 now, she is obsessed with anything and everything military or military history (ww1 &amp; ww2) related. She walks around the house wearing literal military uniforms all day and has several “soldier personas.”

All she wants to do is join the military, everything else is secondary to her. She doesn’t want another job, she is sad over it every day. She hates that she’s been implanted with cochlear implants so she can’t try out the gene therapy thing. She is actually inconsolable, telling her about how tough the military actually is or how bad won’t help, and is not an option. She already looks into that and knows that herself.. one of her favourite books is all quiet on the western front, and favourite movie “come and see.” So she definitely already knows that stuff and “yap talk” about not joining the military. She already does entire military training routines by herself already, like actual proper ones. She just does not want to do anything else.. what can I and what should I even do?

[댓글]
Can you and her analyse what makes her so attracted to these military roles?

Is it the work, the lifestyle, the comradeship, service to country, etc?

Then you can perhaps look for other ways to fulfil these desires: 
- voluntary roles (e.g. first aid)
- other national services with less restrictive medical requirements (civil service, civil defence, intelligence services)
- sport and adventure training
- learning to fly or sail

If she's quite literally dressing in a military uniform every day, acting as if she's a soldier (I'm guessing this is what you meant by having ""soldier personas""?), and distraught at the possibility of having any other life, then I don't think the main issue here is deafness. I glanced at your post history and I see you've also mentioned that she struggles to maintain friendships because other teens don't share her interest and she gets angry with you if you don't role-play as a sergeant to her standards. It's quite normal for a 16 year old to feel passionate about a future career, but it's not normal for them to fixate on it to the point where they're playing dress-up every day, they don't have friends their own age, and they want their parents to play pretend games with them.

Without wanting to armchair diagnose over the internet, has your daughter ever been assessed for autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions? Even if she woke up hearing tomorrow and she passed all the physical tests to get into the military, I suspect she would struggle with many aspects of the life. My brother went into the army at 16 (that's possible in the UK) and our dad was in the RAF. From what I've seen, even people who joined really young don't make it their whole personality. They play sports, they have hobbies and families and friends who aren't military, they have other topics of conversation than WW2. It sounds like your daughter is imagining a group of people who share her absolute focus, and the reality is likely to be a disappointment. A full educational psychology assessment might provide more insight into what her needs and strengths are, and how you can support her best.

Kindly, she should perhaps seek therapy to help her cope with the grief of a lost dream and help her gain the coping skills and strength to pursue avenues that she can strive at.  She knows she can't pursue this occupation but she is still stuck on it.  It is like she is intentionally trying to set herself up for failure which seems very strange to me.

It is okay to have hobbies and ""obsessions"" but if the obsession is one that has taken over your life and is causing a decrease to the quality of your life, then it warrants professional support. This may have nothing to do with her deafness but your daughter's obsessive behavior that is causing her to be inflexible with her life goals and dreams.

It is okay to be ""obsessed"" with a thing like the military and immersing oneself in its culture, history, and values- people and kids do this all the time- but most people are aware that their interests don't necessarily translate into an occupation, such as in your daughter's case, and are able to maintain their interests in a healthy way while also pursuing an alternative profession that may still align and encompass the things she values about the military.

Have you ever considered looking into any local WWI / WWII reenactment communities or events? While it’s not the military career your daughter is looking for, it would be a really good avenue for her to explore her passion for military history with likeminded people. I’d suggest doing some research beforehand to make sure that the regiment / group was supportive and flexible - some are quite strict about who takes on what role based on gender / physical attributes and I think it is really important for your daughter to not feel further constrained by things she can’t control.

Modern military roles are far more about equipment maintenance and operations than running around with a rifle. It sounds like the job she is play-acting is traditional infantry, aka drone food. Ukraine's infantry is spending a lot of time in basements on drone controllers, and we are barely at the dawn of the drone age.

If her dream is to run around with a rifle, she's going to do much more of that as a reenactor or paintball park employee. 

If her dream is to further her country's military capabilities, I'd  say it's time for her to look at her skills. Running around with a gun isn't a marketable skill. So even in the military she'd need to figure out which tasks she was skilled at. But the modern military runs on contractors. Weapon design, vehicle design, repair contracts, service contracts... She could conceivably spend all her time ""doing"" military in a private organization. Or if what she wants is to put herself into risky situations to help people in need, she could be boots on the ground with a foreign aid NGO.

So my advice is, possibly with professional help, try to help her separate ""how I want to look"" (uniformed soldier) from ""what I want to actually do for 40 hours a week."" Because even if she did join the military, she'd spend most of her career holding a computer mouse or a broom, not a rifle.

Maybe see if you could get her into a  internship or job experience.

I’m going to base this on the American military, so it might be totally irrelevant.  Is she interested in the medical field? Our military has doctors and nurses and other medical personnel who are 100% military officers and they’re often much more generous with conditions they’ll waive because those positions are harder to fill.

She can work a civilian job on a military base. I have a deaf friend who works as a cook on a military base

In additional to everything everyone else as said, she could be a military-focus historian.

Countries with conscription often will make room for military service in ways that other countries don't. Where does she live?

Unfortunately, your daughter isn’t the only one. Deaf folk are never likely to get into any kind of Armed Forces regardless of location.

I really am sorry for her, but try to focus less on the negatives of enlisting and try to steer the conversations towards something where she could employ a similar skill set - security, maybe…? It’s a hard realisation, but she will come round to it… with time; once she comes to realise that she can’t make it, that’s when she’ll need to find something else. 

The best advice I was given ( I can’t join up for various medical reasons ), was that the only way to find out is to apply.

It sounds like the best path would be to get her into therapy to help come to terms with everything. If her obsession is as extreme as you're implying, she might have an underlying cause for the military/WWI/WWII obsession that can be treated and help her find a healthy balance between enjoying history and living life. 

Also, maybe you have her meet with veterans to talk about everything? Honest ones that talk about the emotional part as well as the gruesome parts. Being military means having pretty much no say in where you go or what you're doing.

Edit to add: I know you said she knows the reasons not to join but hearing accounts from vets who have night terrors or panic attacks might hit different.

Does your daughter's school have a cadets club? They don't seem very restrictive on who can join at least in the UK, I had autistic classmates who were in the one at my school and autistic people are not always allowed in the military here.

Would be helpful to know your location so we can offer workarounds or solutions depending on country. Different got different solutions.

I would talk to a recruiter, see what jobs can be available in a supporting role, as they probably have something for her that doesn’t require base camp or combat.

Looks like it's time to introduce your kiddo to the concept of spies and see if she can start on the track to be in intelligence!

As someone who’s been obsessed with the military since childhood, and an Army brat myself, I completely understand what your daughter is feeling. I was heartbroken too when I learned that I wouldn’t be able to join the Indian Army and continue the family tradition. It takes time to make peace with that kind of dream, it’s not just a career, it’s an identity.
You can gently help her see that even if she can’t serve in uniform, she can still serve the military in powerful ways. There are so many paths connected to defence and national security, from bureaucracy and policymaking to research, logistics, or even history and war studies. She can work alongside the military, contribute to it, and make things better from within the system.
Her passion for the forces is rare and admirable, it doesn’t have to fade, it just needs a new direction.

And me I'm sitting here just glad I can't join the military because I'm hoh.

I couldn't trust myself to be in such a serious position AND get things done the way they should without making costly mistakes. But I'm glad we have people who live and breathe it to serve and protect. Anyone who wants to do so, in their own way, is already very respectable in my view.

Your daughter must have been born a soldier and a natural helper. I think it's a great thing with how into it she is, and I believe she will find a way to make a difference for many.

Perhaps there are people in the military you can get in touch with who can get her involved in some way.

Gene therapy only works for a very very few very specific cases of deafness. (I want to say only one single case, that was specifically picked because it was by far the easiest compared to almost any other genetic therapy, but I’m not 100% on this. ) 

It is almost certain that there will not be a genetic therapy available for your daughter or any specific random deaf person by the time she is well past military age. 

It’s more likely that advancements in tech will create access to deaf people for military roles eg computer hacker / security expert, or drone pilot / or various IT roles etc. There’s probably already deaf people working in these roles.  I appreciate they’re probably not the ‘yomping about with guns’ that you or your daughter are thinking of, but very few people in the military do that nowadays. 

Another option is to go paintballing. Lots of deaf people go paintballing and there’s guns and camo clothes involved :) I’ve been to deaf kids paintball sessions and it’s a lot of fun and something you can do right now (or quite soon depending on age limits where you live). 

Laser tag is another option if there’s a place near you that does that and maybe more relaxed about 6-year olds doing it.  You can ask the other kids to dress up too and have a face painting session.  I don’t know how the other parents will feel but that’s a separate issue.

She is 16 and life is long. Don’t take for granted she can’t develop in many ways. 

She needs to take responsibility and also do some reflection on potential paths forward. Military history isn’t exactly the same as being in the military today. Is she drawn to it because she wants to do something important for her country? Then there are tons of ways to contribute to support your nation, from politics to diplomacy to being a civilian employee at a military function. Is it an intellectual interest, then being a researcher in military history would be rewarding. If it’s a bit about being physically fit, then she could explore things related to sports. What requirements does the coast guard or rescue service have? Does she want to travel and explore other cultures and do good? Then there are organizations that work with supporting people in crisis or war areas. She will need to think a bit about what things about the military feel so meaningful to her.

An important lessons for teenagers is also that life isn’t always fair, we can’t do just about anything we want, due to all sorts of circumstances. Is it really such a terrible thing that they don’t want her to cause someone getting hurt or killed, let’s say if the CI breaks at the worst occasion? She will have to learn in life to see other people’s perspectives, and that things aren’t black and white. It can be complicated to do the right thing. 

Personally, I’d definitely want the military to be a bit more creative and more inclusive. Why not? The Deaf do have things to contribute with. Military personnel aren’t always in situations where not hearing would would contribute to danger. There ought to be some work where it could be possible to adapt things. Maybe cyber defense, where more communication is digital?

Nonetheless, she does need to be mature and realistic. People aren’t saying no to be mean, but because there are solid arguments for why the military select people with normal hearing.

It's a completely different direction but she could always teach history.

I would try and find her a Deaf or Autistic mentor. Even if she's not autistic they will understand this level of obsession with something and help her decide what to do next. Personally I think military history gonna be a much better fit, but she needs help dealing with the big feelings to work out what to do next (an autistic aware therapist could also work - again id suggest this over a regular one as someone they will be more respectful of your daughters interest and not just tell her to get over it)

Could they join the Peace Corp, get a job and a civilian support person, or work toward getting a DoD clearance and work in a tech field?

What specifically is she interested in?  Obviously the military, but is there a specific branch or field of the military that she is interested in?  I'm going to assume/hope it's not the ""go out and kill the enemy"" sort of interest.  But if there is something more specific, like being a medic, an interest in firearms, an interest in K-9s/military working dogs (patrol, tracking, detecting various items, etc), airplanes, ships, being in nature, tracking and/or orientation, etc, perhaps that could be channeled into a non-military career.  

Like, in order listed above: becoming a nurse or doctor; learning about firearms and working at a range (and/or doing sports like a biathlon); working with dogs to train them in obedience, search and rescue, scent work (tracking, finding drugs, finding explosives, etc), attack and defense, or similar dog careers; mechanical work on any type of vehicle especially one that holds a particular interest (ex airplane mechanic); flying airplanes or working with them in some other capacity; likewise, working with ships/boats in some capacity; becoming a park ranger (which may involve some aspects of the military that she finds interesting, such as being outside, protecting people and the land/country, possibly use of firearms depending on the job, skills in tracking - animals and/or people - and orienteering, learning to survive off the land, etc).

And then channel specific military interests into reenactment groups or other groups of people with hobbies related to some aspects of the military.

Unfortunately you have to be able to hear to get into the military maybe ask her about her other interests besides the military?

I was the same way. I ended up not joining up due to my hearing loss and I'm happy I didn't. With everything in the world right now.

Deaf adult here: 
Her sense of justice is appropriately offended because this is discrimination. 
Hearing people have spent centuries trying to tell Deaf people what they’re allowed to know or do.

She can join the military in Israel.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

I totally understand.

Is your daughter still in school? From experience, people tend to change their minds quite often more so the younger they are. If she's still under age 18, maybe just ride it out. Give support and possibly go visit a recruiter,with a interpreter and let it sort out the way it will. Good luck and best wishes from one MODD to another!

Oh! One more thing I want to say, I also experienced that the more I would try to get a child or younger adult to change their mind, the more stubborn, even more opposing response I received !

Research and see what happens when you look up  military position or jobs on a military base for Deaf people.

I feel for your kid. I grew up wanting to join the Army. It was all I could think about. Until I found out that deaf people, even HoH people weren’t allowed to join.

While she can’t join, she can consider a civil career in the service.

I am HoH for the longest time I wanted to follow in my family’s tradition of serving. At 16 my hearing made me 4F. It still upsets me to this day. I wanted to serve and have a clear purpose. Instead I’ve thrown myself into academia. I’m getting graduate degrees and studying my passions. I’ll always be bitter but maybe remind her you can find that structure and time commitment in other things like education.

As someone who wanted to become a military pilot but had to pivot due to shitty eyesight, I do sympathise. I ended up really digging into what drew me to that job in the first place and where else I could find that, so in my case (minus the thrill of actual flying) it was the camaraderie and urgency of it all, so now I’m in school to become an ER nurse and loving it. Doesn’t mean I’m not still sad over it sometimes but it’s life, not everything works out sadly. And also I definitely still engage with it in other ways, apart from reading about it/watching videos I often make my to-do lists as mission briefings/reports and I have a ‘tactical’ weight vest I put on for when I gotta really crunch work for uni, also I do some air force physical training stuff to help me stay active. Include it in life however you can, it’s good fun. Hope y’all find something she enjoys doing, the military truly isn’t very welcoming to folks with medical conditions.

(Oh and as others have mentioned, this sound very autism-coded to me so I’m not sure how best to approach making her feel better about this. Best of luck!)

I was in your daughters shoes in middle school and high school I had looked forward to being able to sign up for the military I wanted to be apart of the military I wanted to serve the country weather it was infantry or combat medic or a pilot or a PJ or a cop or a firefighter it didn’t matter but when I tried I got denied by every branch including the coast guard. I was upset I was researching and trying to find something cause it had also upset me that you can’t join with hearing loss but you can lose your hearing in the military and still stay. I had also found a bill that talked about allowing deaf and hard of hearing into the military but never found any follow up on it… I had also found programs in the civilian world like civil air patrol or civilian position in the military.

Flash forward to now at 23 years old I’m currently an EMT on a metropolitan ambulance for the fire department I’m almost done with paramedic school and Im a volunteer firefighter hopefully to switch to a full time suppression position after medic school. I’ve had the privilege to talk to many military medics riding along or just meeting them wither they are active duty or retired and the main thing I’ve noticed is that they’ve all had said if you want to make a difference do it in the civilian world you get to make more of a difference there than in the military.

Why not provide her with computer science skills? This would enable her to contribute to the army in a computer-related capacity.

She could get a waiver to be a JAG. She probably wouldn’t want to by the end of law school. But I went because I got told “no” for ROTC on account of being deaf.

I was rejected from the military. It sucks it was part of my admissions essay. Maybe she can work as a civilian for the military.

Yeah I grew up idolizing Samantha Carter from Stargate and seriously wanted to join the Air Force for years. I cried when I realized that I couldn't. Even if I know how shit the military is, it's something I'll always regret that I never even had the chance to try.

Please look into finding her a counselor/therapist that specializes in neurodivergence

Happened to me as well and am just very hard of hearing because of loud tinnitus. One door closes and another one will open. Hugs ❤️❤️❤️

Same thing happened to my father. Sometimes life can be that way.

I am male but I would never join the military - Deaf or not deaf. It is an insidious and violent patriarchal cabal responsible for massive amounts of destruction, a lot of which has been directed against women. The military stinks on every level from its regimentation to the parades, medallions, badges of honour and the weaponry that awaits great employment upon the unfortunate populaces it is intended to destroy. When it comes to war (even those wars currently underway) women are often sexually abused and killed in extreme ways in order to 'serve' the soldiers 'desires'. As some women have said, where there is war, there is sexual violence against women.

She may actually be eligible to apply for certain Air Force programs.

my siblings and I all are HoH and don't qualify either. I had hopes even then of maybe doing Lip Reading as a consultant like Susan Thomas did for the FBI instead, but even that failed due to parents who prioritized hearing raising us and the government was trying to develop tech to do the lip reading for them.  Support roles might still be an option, for example a lot of vets will lose their hearing and need treatment or to learn how to get by and speak sign. She could become an audiologist and deaf educator for Veteran Affairs. Multiple medical roles are needed. If that's not interesting enough there is also doing research and development, there's a good book called ""Grunt"" by Mary Roach that discusses a lot of the science for the military. If she can't be James Bond she can still be Q.

I'm so incredibly sorry. My son is the same, not deaf, but obsessed with the military, talked about being enlisted since the age of 4, he's 21 now, 22 soon, and the way my 6ft, 250lb son bawled when we found out the insane reason he's not allowed to join? Heartbreaking. For my son, he was born with a tiny, somewhat descended testicle that he had to have surgically removed when the doctor finally noticed at 12... You can't join the Army if you're missing a testicle either 🤷‍♀️ like the most random and unnecessary limitation. I don't have any advice because not being allowed to follow through on your life dream is incredibly difficult for anyone, especially a teenager who has never considered it prior because they were so fully invested. I've been told to contact ""MEPS"" and ask for a waiver, it's not always a possibility and might not be at all, but it helped my son process to not *just* be told no, outright, without even attempting the physical and such. Maybe that would be something your daughter could do as well 💗

I'm based in the US. I have always known it wasn't an option. I have several family members that are veterans. It would been nice for it to be an option for me but never was. I did the JROTC program in high school. Now that I'm in my 30s, I've been enjoying the life as a military contractor working on bases all over the country.

Would your daughter consider enrolling in a military school? Not sure what their requirements are. I have no firsthand experience with them (other than my dad working as a teacher at one when I was in 2nd grade.) my general understanding is that they’re either for “problem kids” who “need discipline” or for kids who intend to enlist in the military after graduation. What about the ROTC (reserve officers training corps)? This is in the U.S. by the way. I know nothing about ROTC. Just thought I’d throw it out there since no one else has mentioned it. It would depend on how your daughter communicates with the CI. Is she 100% oral, if so, is her language at age level? I don’t really see military schools being very tolerant of deafness, hearing loss, OR neurodivergent. I would imagine the actual military is similar. 

Agree with what others have said, it’s very possible to work on a military base as a civilian. And to go to school for advanced degrees that will be in high demand by military adjacent fields such as weapons development, cybersecurity, or rocketry or something. She might have a better chance of getting in through a private military contractor with a unique skill set. Agree too that the days of masses of soldiers fighting on the ground are probably long past. Not encouraging it or anything but does she like video games with military themes? More likely to be better than the real thing, plus not getting dirty.

I was in the US Navy for over 8 years and Sea Cadets before that. I think she would like the Sea Cadets. 

There are civilian rolls you can play that are just as valid as active duty. I know a man who is a little person and he is a drone pilot. Military hospitals employ civilians. There are a LOT of support jobs as well on base like MWR and NEX. People who love military history can be history teachers and authors. She might be appalled by the notion but I'm sure she could be a military wife too and they normally prioritize hiring military spouses for on base positions. 

I don't know what kind of job would work for her. It sounds like she may have some other developmental, neurodivergent, or emotional differences that may affect what kind of job would work best for her. 

Her mental health provider can also help to navigate this. 

As a Navy veteran I can guarantee that people who love the military that much do NOT have a good time once they get in. They are crushed in so many ways and completely reform how they see the world. I was one of them. Even if she did enlist, all of the parts of her that made her love the military would be ripped out of her heart and she would find that nothing in this world matters or makes sense. 

It's also not a fun time to struggle to hear when the lives of the people around you depend on your ability to hear. The stress from that can destroy a person. People with hearing difficulties and other things do get in by lying or cheating sometimes.

Remembered a possibility 'Civil Air Patrol Youth Program' they have uniforms, I've seen them do activities like presenting Flags at events (A State Congressional Award Youth Participant Ceremony another good program to consider) and teach the kids about flying. They will take kids up to 18 and allow kids with Disabilities (they do have to know of them so accommodations and precautions can be made) according to their website. It will give her a taste of military and a chance to meet and network with likeminded people. They had chrome looking helmets I recall.

There are probably more programs like this and volunteer work for the different branches. Maybe ask their recruiters what's available for teens and young adults in this. Get her in ones that allow disabled to join, it can help her show them what she is capable of, network and learn of areas she could work.  

With her interest in the history and facts teaching, tour guide, military museums, film consultant, archivist and writing about all this could be other ways too. e.g. a history book about the disabled in the military and intelligence agencies. I heard of a woman WWII who used her prosthetic leg to help hide things while helping the resistance. You might be able to redirect her to writing the book to double it as research to make her case to one of the branches later. It'll also show her what kind of challenges they ran into

I can imagine how difficult this must be for both of you. Unfortunately, deaf individuals aren’t currently able to serve in the US military, even in non-combat roles. That said, there are still ways she can channel her passion, through military history research, volunteering with veteran organizations, or pursuing related careers in security or defense, etc.  She clearly has incredible dedication and drive, and with the right guidance, she can find other meaningful ways to do what she loves.

You may want to consider the possibility she's on the spectrum.

My suggestion would have to go to your attorney on civil rights or something like disability attorney not sure

Do y’all know sign language, or was she forced into oral-only?  I don’t know about disabilities &amp; active combat roles, but perhaps… sniper???  It’s much more long-range visual focus &amp; acuity, hiding &amp; camouflage, insane amounts of patience, etc.   There are many hand signals for communication, &amp; notes, maps, trajectories, etc.  🤷🏻‍♀️",2025-10-25 11:57:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ofpowq/my_daughter_is_deaf_and_shes_inconsolable_because/
1ofo1ti,deaf,I keep missing opportunities to get my corrective surgery earlier,"I have moderate conductive hearing loss in my left ear, dealing with this for over 5 years now. I’ve also been on a surgery waitlist for over a year now. Basically there’s a piece of my incus that disintegrated causing me to lose my hearing and I’m awaiting surgery to fix it. I don’t have a definitive date yet because the waitlist is 2+ years (Albertan for context). This would be the 3rd time this year I missed a call for a cancellation due to my terrible luck.

I’m in university and I’ve gotten 3 cancellation calls this year but somehow they all magically happen whenever I’m doing an exam. I had a midterm on Thursday at 11 and I remember checking the time before putting my phone in my backpack and it said 10:57. So I finish my midterm and I am checking my phone as I’m walking out of my class. I see that my surgeon’s office called me at 10:58. LITERALLY 1 MINUTE AFTER I PUT MY PHONE AWAY. Checked my voicemail, it was a cancellation for this Tuesday coming up. I called them and they had already filled up the spot…

I’m actually still so upset about this even though it happened on Thursday. I’m just so frustrated having to deal with this terribly funded healthcare system. It’s not my surgeon’s fault. There aren’t enough doctors, nurses, surgeons, etc… here and the provincial government is giving all their money to private organizations rather than funding our already existing public healthcare services.

I just want to be able to live my life again. This is exhausting.

There are hundreds of different Sign Languages: American ( ASL ), British ( BSL ), French, Italian, AuSLAN, etc. 

In BSL, some signs can look very similar but actually have very different meanings, so you really have to make sure you’re learning from a reputable source. I’d suggest you definitely search for your nearest course. There’s International Sign, but I really don’t know much about that….

Op, where do you live?

You can learn sign language by following YouTube/Instagram videos. I see there are many new deaf content creators posting their videos it might be help you. If you're indian You can learn ISL(Indian sign language) courses from organization like gift abled, v-shesh etc

1oflnri,deaf,Did not know life would take this turn,"

I found out that I was suffering from Usher Syndrome Type 2 over a month ago. It was really heartbreaking for me and I was feeling like this disease totally cracked up my dreams on everything.I am just a teen now. I lost hope. I saw the people who care about me feeling sad for me. And suddenly the people who didn't give a shit about me, suddenly they started caring for me. And I think it's not love but it's them pitying me, which I hate the most. Well, if you're wondering what is usher Syndrome, then it is a disease, like it is a genetic condition. And for information, no one in my family has ever gotten this kind of disease as far as my family knows. That means that slowly when I was a child, my hearing capacity started decreasing day by day until my mother took me to the hospital and found out that my hearing capacity was so much less than others. That means I could not hear properly what others said and I've been struggling because of that for many years. And now I'm finding out about this, that I have night blindness and I am starting to lose my peripheral vision. I have already lost my side vision and now I may go blind actually. So my dream was crushed before me. So I decided to write this post to ask someone maybe, especially if you have usher Syndrome or seen anyone with usher Syndrome or anyone who is going to be turning blind or is blind and they are living a happy life right now. What career did they follow as far as you knew about it? Well, although my life took this turn, I believe that other lives may have been worse than me and I decided to not lose hope. So could you please give me some suggestions about my career development? And what I can say just for now is that I don't like to study science. And I have always wished to pursue IT and become a data scientist or something related to data in the field of computer science, probably IT. And I have always wished to go abroad and live my life very peacefully.

May try posting in r/deafblind or find a local deafblind group?


You can totally do data science or it if you want, and can def travel overseas. But yeah I know lots of Deafblind people and they all live happy successful lives, same as everyone else. Most of the ones that I know work at the Deafblind society, just bc that's where I know them from, but that means they do a whole bunch of different jobs lots of them using computers. 


You probably also want to contact your local blind society for help learning Braille, because that's likely to be really helpful in your future, and maybe start learning sign now as well bc a lot of ushers ppl losing hearing first and so find learning tactile sign easier having learned visual sign first.


But yeah, heaps of ppl have ushers, you are far from alone in this and there's absolutely still lots of reasons to have hope, and it will be so much easier to do once you find community 💚

Sudden deafness is incredibly difficult. It is isolating and it puts the body under stress. Self-care and therapy and every sort of support you can think of is needed. You need to lean into sign language, specifically ASL. As much as you can, try to enter into the community, even just online. When you are fluent with the language and the culture, and the technological assists available these days, you can pursue most careers. But you have to embrace your new world, embrace ASL, and be a friend to yourself—-losing hearing is more traumatic than anyone realizes. But it can be overcome.

I know 2 people with Usher Syndrome and they are now legally blind.  One is a social worker and the other is a travel blogger.  Both use tactile ASL and protactile

Good for you to not give in to despair. It’s a harsh diagnosis, and it’s important to let yourself face experience your feelings. It’s how we choose to act on them that makes the difference. Telling our stories and seeking help is terrific. I encourage you to check out Facebook or other internet DeafBlind groups. Depending on where you live Google DeafBlind organizations. In Wisconsin there is the state run Office for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing for information and resources. The organization offering training and services is the Center for Deaf-Blind persons. They work with people throughout the state. Hopefully your area has at least a Department of Office for People with Disabilities.  You may be entitled for various types of assistance and accommodations, especially while still a student. Keep going, you’re on the right path!

I'm a communication support worker for d/Deafblind adults. Most of them have Usher syndrome type 1 or type 2. I've been kayaking on the sea with one person, I regularly help another with her amazing embroidery (I just make sure she has the colours she wants, she can thread the needle and work out her designs by touch alone), I've accompanied others to museums, to the gym and the swimming pool, to college classes and the theatre and political protests and choir practices and job interviews. One is a full-time parent to a toddler and planning to go to college when he's old enough for school. One speaks four languages fluently and works as a teacher. One is a professional baker and cake decorator. As for going abroad, I support two sisters with Usher's who live to travel and if I mention wanting to visit a particular country they invariably fish out some photos from when they were there. Outside my job, I've met a dancer who is Deafblind and who travels internationally to perform and to take part in competitions. People with Usher syndrome are as diverse as any other group of humans and there is no reason why you shouldn't have a full, interesting life with the condition.

It's only natural for us to feel frightened by uncertainty and to grieve when we start to lose something we once took for granted, especially a sense. Don't force yourself to feign positivity that you can't feel, and be kind to yourself. But at the same time, don't start treating your fears and anxieties as facts. This is where getting to know other people with Usher's would be helpful for you, especially people who have type 1 or who have been living with sight loss from type 2 for a long time. Right now you're very naturally worried about what you'll lose, but with their life experience they'll be able to introduce you to possibilities and opportunities that might not have even occurred to you at this point. If you're happy to say which country you're in, people here might know of some good local contacts and resources for you.

I am DeafBlind but I don't have US. However, it's the most well known cause of deafblindess in the Deaf community in the US and Canada. (I can say this confidently because everyone assumes I have US without asking and I know many DeafBlind who do have it.) I know quite a few successful and happy DB folks who do have US though. A few don't work but quite a few do-- social services, admin, tech/IT, and arts seem to be the most common professions but people do all sorts of things. I even know one DB ASL interpreter.

Also, do your mobility skills training now. Learn braille now. If you don't sign, learn now and start working on it both visually and tactilely. Having all these open to you will help you perform better and be more competitive when you find an employer that does not care if you're deafblind, only that you can do your job. If you wait until you feel you're sure you're sure you're ""blind enough"" that you need it already, you are setting yourself up to feel frustrated and pressured. Anyone on the blind spectrum can learn that stuff.

Also, if you have Ushers 2a specifically there's a new gene therapy going into final clinical trials that may be able to save and possibly even restore some of your sight. It's still experimental but it has been working in human patients. (You will still lose your hearing even with that therapy, so learning to sign will do a lot for giving you access. Outside of regular work roles there's a lot of professional networking stuff needed for professional advancement in IT, so you will want to be able to use an interpreter as a way to access larger groups of people where captioning doesn't cut it well for keeping up, telling you who, and conveying tone and intent.)

1ofinw5,deaf,Why all the hate?,"Edit: for those wondering, I have an autosomal recessive syndrome that has wiped out most of my OAEs (outer and inner hair cells) making my pure tones decline on a weekly to monthly basis


I know I’m going to get hate for this but I got to ask because I’m genuinely curious as someone who is experiencing rapid and progressive loss: 

Why do some culturally Deaf folks feel the need to look down on late-deafened people who are actively trying to learn, connect, and survive the exact same shit, just after years of hearing first?

Better yet, why are there flairs for HoH and HI if we don’t belong?

[댓글]
You’ll get different answers, but honestly it all comes down to identity, experience, history, and how people communicate those things. 

Here’s my two cents, I’m adding some extra bits in to help anyone else reading along - just ignore the other stuff if it doesn’t apply to what you’re asking.

Just like other identity terms - gay, Christian, Navajo, atheist, two spirit, Afro Latin, refugee, diaspora - words like Deaf, hard of hearing, or hearing impaired help describe experience and belonging. These labels aren’t meant to exclude, though sometimes they end up doing that, they’re meant to help define and communicate these experiences.

The problems you’re likely experiencing are common unfortunately, but also come with a long standing history that needs to be considered depending on context. 
I don’t think I could condense all of it, but I’ll do my best and encourage anyone to look into it more.

These identities mean different things to different people, and that flexibility is good. Everyone should be free to identify with what fits their experience best. No one should act like an authority on how others define themselves.

Someone born deaf, raised in a Deaf family, who went to a Deaf school will likely identify as Deaf. That word carries culture, language, and shared experience. Their life will look very different from someone who grew up hearing or became deaf later.

Culturally Deaf people are often profoundly deaf and use sign as their main language. They have deep cultural ties, but not all of them share the same path. Think of “Deaf” the way “gay” can be both an umbrella term and a specific identity.

You don’t have to be Deaf to be in the community though, and no one controls how you define yourself. Of course people will ask questions, that’s just normal. 

Many hard of hearing people live between both worlds. Some have mild hearing loss, others are profoundly deaf but prefer to identify as HoH. Some lean more toward hearing spaces, others toward Deaf ones. Everyone’s mix is different. Some people sign, some speak, some type or gesture.

What we all share is hearing loss, in different degrees.

As for Deaf spaces, sometimes they seem exclusionary, but that’s not always bad. They exist to protect the community and make connection easier without needing to slow down or explain everything.

Many Deaf only events are to help the community connect and have less focus on learners and hearing students, as it’s an important pillar of the community. 

When people ask why some culturally Deaf look down on late deafened people, I tell them it’s complicated. It’s not always about pride. Sometimes it’s about protection.

For generations, Deaf people were punished for signing. Oral schools forced speech and lipreading. Many Deaf adults today grew up being told that signing was wrong or shameful. Because of that, Deaf schools and Deaf spaces became sacred. They were the few places where sign was normal, where communication didn’t take extra effort.

I grew up partially oral with language deprivation. Forced to speak. Not allowed to sign. When I first went to a Deaf school, I had finally found home. But a few kids didn’t like me because I could speak. Some even said I wasn’t really Deaf, and I didn’t understand. They said it was because I had a hearing family, I grew up speaking, I went to a hearing school. But, I still couldn’t hear. 

At first, it hurt. I didn’t understand why. Later, I realized many of them had grown up surrounded by sign and Deaf culture since birth. Their world was built on fluency, shared struggle, and safety. When someone like me walked in - someone who spoke, who came from the hearing world - it brought back memories of the things that had hurt them. Oralism, exclusion, being told signing was wrong. I reminded them of that, even though I didn’t mean to.

People call it Deaf elitism. The idea that to be truly Deaf, you need a Deaf family, Deaf friends, Deaf everything. But underneath that is fear - fear of losing the one space where we don’t have to explain, perform, or teach. The one place where we don’t have to argue to be heard.

I’ve seen both sides. I know what it feels like to be shut out for speaking. I also understand wanting a place that feels untouched by hearing influence. When I visit friends from Deaf families, it’s like another world - everything signed, everyone understood. It’s beautiful, and I can see why it should be protected, and that it’s not always intended as exclusion. 

It’s also worth protecting identities, they can be meaningful, but some people forget how varied the Deaf experience can be. 

Compared to hearing people, there’s not that many of us. So when one of us speaks up, we want it to be someone who truly represents us, someone who knows the experiences we’re referring to, the language, the habits and beliefs we have.

Both sides carry pain. One side fights to keep what they built. The other side is just trying to find a place inside it.

Also, sometimes people are just dicks. Being deaf/hoh does not make you immune from being one, unfortunately. 

(P.S I’m not sure what you mean about the flairs, as it’s a community, and of course flairs for different identities would be available. Everyone has equal place here, but I’m not sure if you’re referring to a focus on Deaf specific voices. (Aka if you’re wondering why Deaf voices are prioritized in some discussions, I can make a reply specific to that)

I down voted solely for the 12yo ""down votes prove I'm right"" opening. You can still learn how to approach your target audience respectfully when asking for free education....that you've already shown you don't actually feel you need, bc you're supposedly right.

In my experience, it can cause some tension to talk about the grief of hearing loss. For (many) culturally Deaf people, no or little hearing is a point of pride (in an identity sort of way). So, when late-deafened people talk about the *grief* that comes with losing a sensory ability, it can cause an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance with someone who sees the same experience without grief.

Both experiences are valid—the pride and the grief. But sometimes when people have conflicting internal experiences around the same external experience, it can cause emotional clashing because someone’s different experience can feel invalidating towards our own experience. 

Grief is especially tricky, as expressing it can bring up strong emotions in anyone—which some people internalize too much (affective empathy), and then feel like they’re being told they should grieve how they were born, which is an ableist perspective the hearing world has forced on the Deaf community (“something is wrong with the way you were born”). 

Obviously, a late-deafened person’s own grief *isn’t* forcing this same perspective onto some born/early-deafened and culturally Deaf. But, it can *feel* like it, which leads some people to jump to a self-protective exclusion. It’s just misplaced emotion, which leads to lateral violence (something seen in every marginalized community, when people don’t feel safe/able/validated to project emotions towards their oppressors).

Dear hearing people…  Sit this one out…

This question feels a bit akin to asking a group of Black people “why do some Black people do x?” 

Hard of hearing people are largely accepted in the deaf and Deaf communities and especially in this particular subreddit. Deafness is a spectrum. If you’ve encountered some people in your adventures navigating hearing loss who are rude, that’s a reflection of individual ideas and you shouldn’t really consider it a reflection of deaf people as a whole. We aren’t a monolith.

Edited: (After reading this sub I don't think I'm late  deaf. I think im late diagnosed)

  Ethier way im Hoh/ deaf maybe your interacting with the wrong people.  
Every group has good and bad. 

It depends on how you come off. 

I've found alot of welcoming people in my own journey. There's been good and bad. But I choose to interact with the ones that want to talk to me.  

I also don't expect them to help me. If they offer cool.

Did you really get the hate or are you just assuming? Our community welcomes new signers all the time.

I'm late hoh and no one in the Deaf community has been rude to me. I think it's good to know your place though. My experience is very different from someone who was born profoundly deaf.

Simple answer is we all are different points of views. That pretty much sums it up.

I was aware of my hearing loss at 17, but was probably losing it well before that. I got my first hearing aids at 23. I can hear ‘okay’ for normal conversations in person, as long as there isn’t a lot going on around, but if someone walks away, turns away, there’s a tv playing, it’s a restaurant… I can’t understand anymore. I can’t understand kids though. Or thick accents. Phones are getting harder and harder, but I can’t seem to get dr offices to email instead of call, and chatbots are bullshit compared to actually talking to customer service, so I’m stuck perpetually asking people to repeat themselves. I have to listen to everything at max volume, or have my hearing aids at 80% so that my tv can be at 25. Captions are a must no matter what. I basically don’t listen to any new music past the mid 2010s, cuz that’s when my hearing really seemed to take a dive in certain tones.

I tried learning ASL, but my memory sucks and my fingers don’t move well for spelling, so I feel like I’m going to be marooned when I can’t understand speech anymore but can’t understand Sign. I tried going to a couple Deaf events years ago with a friend who was studying to be an interpreter, but as soon as people realized I couldn’t Sign, they ignored me. I’ve definitely seen the gatekeeping of ‘you weren’t born this way’ — but i was. I didn’t have an accident or illness. This is just progressive deafness as I get older, that’s been happening since I was a kid. You don’t get to tell me I’m not deaf. I read the history, I read fiction about deaf characters, memoirs. I’m facing discrimination at work because I had my boss trying to throw me on phones earlier this year when I was supposed to come back for modified duty, and said ‘oh we’ll just give you headphones’ even though I told him repeatedly that I. Cannot. Be. Trusted. To. Take. Patient. Info. Over. The. Phone. With. My. Hearing. Loss. I have coworkers constantly trying to talk to me from down the hall or even just with their back turned. I have coworkers who treat me like I’m stupid because I’ve asked them to slow down, repeat themselves, speak up. 

I do agree with the difference of deaf/Deaf, and I’m deaf because I didn’t grow up in the culture and don’t Sign, don’t go to events. But I don’t go because I don’t feel welcome. I feel like an outsider. I’m not hearing, I’m more than hard of hearing, but I’m not Deaf. I’m just deaf and all I’m gonna be able to do eventually soon is read lips a little and communicate by text and charades.

Because many late deafened people refuse to learn and accept deaf culture. And what you perceive as rude, is probably deaf blunt, if you're feelings get hurt easily, then you're probably going to have a difficult time in the deaf communities. In the deaf community, if you're fat, they'll say you're fat, if you're going bald, they'll comment on that, if you have stinky breath, they're going to tell you. It's not rudeness, it's about the most honest form of communication you're ever going to get, and it will hurt your feelings. 

It is my experience, that some late deafened individuals seek to force their own culture change on deaf culture.  They want to come into an area and say, hey, why is the deaf community so hateful, without actually speaking to anybody in the deaf community, or becoming knowledgeable about deaf culture. 

If you are approaching people in your own local deaf community with the same tone and wording you made with this post, there is a direct reason for the vitriol you're facing.

I’m sorry you’re struggling. The Deaf community can be wonderful but it can also be insular and bigoted in many ways. It’s been very difficult for me to deal with myself with my Deaf son. I recommend reading some books on Deaf history to help you understand where people are coming from.

They do not. I don't know what you are on about.

im late deaf and i have yet to run into any issues with this

“ Edit 2: for those wondering, I have an autosomal recessive syndrome that has wiped out most of my OAEs (outer and inner hair cells) making my pure tones decline on a weekly to monthly basis”

This isn’t a thing.  If your hair cells were “mostly wiped out”, your audiogram would be waaay different.

You’re dramatically misinterpreting what you’re being told by your doctors and then jumping straight to demanding everyone accept your misunderstanding while you crash out about gatekeeping.

You aren’t being automatically understood by the community because you get outright angry when anyone points out reality to you.

I’m going deaf too and it’s hard because everyone around me wants me to do normal hearing things. But if I go to a movie or am caught outside next to a honking vehicle, or even sat in a loud restaurant I lose significant amounts of hearing. My family are so loud in everything they do too it’s hard to spend time with them in a room. So I’m caught between just staying in my room all the time or wear earplugs all the time , damn it’s just hard. I feel like a fish out of water and am sad that my old boss did this to me.

I find it very strange that half the posts here lately are non culturally Deaf people just shitting on Deaf people and saying how we’re awful and bad and mean? Like? Maybe do some reflection on that. 

I think the reality is- a lot of people, and particularly hearing people who are weirdly obsessed with being part of our lived experiences and world, don’t like actually having to respect or understand a culture. A lot of people don’t like being told no or that something isn’t for or about them. And they get upset and lump us all together as one big monolith in their upset.

People with medical hearing loss or late deafened tend to be the same- they go “I’m the exact same as you” and try to push past actually UNDERSTANDING and being respectful of the culture and community they’re trying to enter and then get pissy and upset that they’re not automatically given a trophy and loved by every Deaf person. Part of connecting with a culture involves understanding it and be respectful on that journey.

TRUMP'S FAULT.

HOH here: i think pride sometimes turns into ego, which turns into rudeness. 🫡sincerely someone whos been HOH since ~6 months, and jumps the line between hearing and deaf constantly for shits and giggles

I'm a little surprised no one has yet mentioned crab bucket theory/ mentality.

1ofgtw7,deaf,Type 1 Diabetes and Deaf/HoH Experiences,"*This survey/post has been mod approved.*

Hello! I am currently a second year graduate student in my M.A. program at Gallaudet University and working on my thesis research project - ""Accessing Competent Care with Type 1/1.5 Diabetes: Hearing and Deaf Barriers"". This research has received IRB approval from my university, as well as mod approval for posting in this sub.

I am a type 1 diabetic of 22 years and am late-deaf as of my early 20s. I chose this topic because I felt like there was not enough information or documentation of the lived experiences of people living with both T1D and deafness. Current research publications have no mention of the barriers deaf and hard of hearing T1Ds experience in accessing competent care or information outside of the generalized medical system experiences such as interpreter quality or availability. The objective of this research is to identify the self-reported experiences, both good and bad, to help guide development of potential education, training, and awareness for those providing medical care for T1Ds, as well as care provided specifically to deaf/HoH T1Ds.

As part of this research, I am collecting responses through a survey (link below) about experiences with medical professionals providing care for T1Ds. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and responses are anonymous.

I am looking for responses from Americans over the age of 18 who live with type 1/1.5 diabetes. If you are willing to contribute to and support my research, please take the survey and know that I am sending you the biggest thank you!

Thank you so much for your time!

1ofd8cc,deaf,Music for the Deaf,"Preface: I am not deaf, but have had life long issues with my ears and dozens of surgeries to save my hearing since I was young. Because of this I’ve always been inspired by the Deaf community and decided to start learning ASL awhile back. 

I recently saw an artist/DJ named DVS1. He advertised and toured with a sound system called “The Wall of Sound”. I’m not sure how to adequately describe it, but having been going to live music events and festivals for 15+ years- never have I ever experienced music in such a physical way. The sound system was so intense that it created a physical dimension to the music that would vibrate gutturally in your body, it felt like it could lift you off your feet. 

It got me thinking about how someone wouldn’t even need to be a hearing person to experience the music. I did some research and found out in Berlin there are people in the deaf community who actually go clubbing to places with incredible sound systems for this reason. 

I am actually a music producer and sound designer and I’ve been dreaming about what it would look like to make music specifically for the deaf. Obviously this music would be something that is experienced in person rather than made traditionally for small speaker systems/headphones- meaning it would be an event/concert. 

I’m curious if anyone here knows of someone doing something similar to this, or seen people who have had similar ideas? 

I’d love to hear thoughts/opinions/ideas/interest from people within the deaf community about this. ",2025-10-24 23:55:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ofd8cc/music_for_the_deaf/
1of70wp,deaf,I resent my parents,"I was born with profound hearing loss. In my opinion, it will decline even further as I have already noticed it. 

My parents think that sign language is something for stupid people who can’t do anything or achieve something in life. Same for deaf schools.

They did put a lot of work in so that I can talk well, which I do(but not English, that’s not my 1st language). However, they basically left me with nothing - just constant reliance on lipreading(and that’s not an effective tool at all when I literally can’t hear). 

I recently discovered a video from my speech therapy appointment from when I was three. The speech therapist turned me away from her and kept asking some basic questions. Even then, I couldn’t understand anything that was being said with my back turned away. Well, that’s obvious it would be impossible with just hearing aids.

My parents did have a choice to implant me but chose not to(idk why, shame or thinking that I’m somehow better that others?). Ok then. But they also didn’t send me to a deaf school even though it’s not even far away.

Now, as an adult, I can no longer pair the hearing I have left and lipreading because there’s almost nothing of my hearing left. Talking with people, especially new ones, is impossible even with lipreading. I know a handful of people with CI’s and they can talk on phone or not rely on lipreading. My blood boils because it could’ve been me if it weren’t for my parents’ arrogance and ignorance. Well yeah I could get the CI now but as an adult it’s useless, I won’t have the same result as those who were implanted early on.

Moral of the story: shame on the parents who hate their children enough to not give them access to ANY world and leaving them to deal with it themselves.",2025-10-24 19:28:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1of70wp/i_resent_my_parents/

1odlddn,deaf,Hearing parent of a Deaf child looking for advice on schools.,"
We currently live in Ohio. Husband and I are wanting to move (pretty much anywhere if the cost of living isn’t astronomical) but want our daughter to be in a Deaf school. She’s in a small program based in a public school for Deaf/HoH kids but it only goes up to Kindergarten so this will be her last year there. We aren’t comfortable mainstreaming yet. We agreed to start at a Deaf school and as she gets older then let her make that decision if and when she’s ready.

So far I’ve looked into a few schools but I’m not sure how to decide. I don’t necessarily think there’s one “best” school but I also don’t know what to really look for as I have no experience with this. I made a list of the schools we are looking into but if anyone has any experience or recommendations of any of these schools they would be willing to share we would greatly appreciate it:


-Tennessee School for the Deaf (looks like there’s 3 different ones?)

-Oklahoma School for the Deaf

-Virginia School for the Deaf 

-Pennsylvania School for the Deaf

-Kentucky School for the Deaf 

-North Carolina School for the Deaf

-Georgia School for the Deaf 

-Florida School for the Deaf

[댓글]
Kansas School for the Deaf is amazing. Have had family go there. Great staff.

I can vouch for Tennessee School for the Deaf Knoxville where my wife teaches.Bilingual ASL/English program. Main problem currently is being able to find an affordable place to live as Knoxville and the surrounding area is turning into a popular boom town.

Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf isn't too far away in Pittsburgh!

Ideally, tour the places and meet the people, but that may not be possible as not everyone can easily travel. See if there are virtual tours or ways to meet and chat with people, as you can feel the vibe and get some answers that you may not be able to find online. See if you can join local deaf communities’ facebook pages to read posts and ask as a parent of a deaf child. My local Deaf community Facebook page has people asking about moving here all the time, so I don’t think it’s unusual. 

All Deaf schools have their pros and cons. Some schools have more resources or stronger extracurricular programs. Some have stronger academic programs or access to options such as dual credit enrollment (I know this is for HS, but if you hope to stay with one school, it’s something to think about). Some are located in cities, and some in suburban areas, so cost of living, job opportunities, lifestyle, etc. are something to consider as well. Larger Deaf communities mean more diversity but it can feel too big and hard to connect, while a smaller Deaf community can feel more tight-knitted but maybe too insular. Many, many things to consider, and no right answer as it’s different for each child and their family.

Edited to add that while social media is obviously made for the public eye, it can be a way to “see” some schools, as some websites can be text heavy. My Deaf school has public Instagram accounts for the school itself and for various departments, such as each academic department, athletics, and student life.

You’ve made a great choice already of letting her decide and putting her in a school that fits her needs now. You can search this subreddit for the best schools but I’ll talk about some things that might help the search.

There’s a few things to look for, and a lot depends on your needs and hers. You can ask around for experiences but one of your best bets is going to visit the schools themselves. It’s a pain in the ass but if some are close the trip is worth it.

Compare which have the programs and support you need, check the language environment, the social scene around the schools, and even residential schools. 

Ask what the environment is like, is it majority asl? Is it mixed with spoken English? 
Check for early elementary classes and individual support.

Look for a strong Deaf social presence nearby, it’s so so important to have community close by. Check Facebook for groups, local chapters and organizations, and even non profits. 

Most Deaf schools offer ASL classes and support for family, but not all are the same. 
Ask what family education or support they offer. Also check the support available for the state, local programs, rehab, workforce opportunities, and connected after high school connections. 

The biggest Deaf communities are in the biggest cities, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and of course Washington. 

One of the largest is Rochester NY, but anywhere with a Deaf school/universities/services are hubs for communities. But lots of Deaf doesn’t guarantee the environment you want. (ASL rich, early years strong, good teacher to student ratios, etc).

Someone said the Kansas School for the Deaf and I second that. The community in this area is pretty great from my own experience. 

I would not suggest any of the schools in the south right now, just because of the current political climate and their views on disabilities as a whole. That is also coming from my own experience having lived and spending time down in the south as a hard of hearing and disabled person.

the “big” k-12 deaf schools are: texas, maryland, california (fremont &amp; riverside), clerc center, florida.   i’m not necessarily saying they are better but i encourage you to compare them as well when considering smaller schools.

Indiana school for the deaf is great or mssd in Washington DC

Hi! I’m a student intern at the Ohio School for the Deaf. It’s a great school but really only intended for kids who exclusively sign or have little auditory access. If you are looking for a bilingual option I would not chose OSD. 

I would reach out to state wide services (through OSD) if you are looking to stay in ohio https://osd.ohio.gov/our-departments/statewide-services-outreach/statewide-services. Mandi Hinton is the educational audiologist on the team and is amazing. 

You could also reach out to the ESC who will have more info if you did want to mainstream https://www.escco.org/DeafHardofHearing.aspx

WPSD near Pgh. They have a ton of endowments and great facilities. Pgh supposeded is one of the most affordable metro areas in the US.

If you’re already in the Midwest then you might want to look at Minnesota. There is a traditional residential school, but the school that is growing and in my opinion, a more modern approach, is the metro school for the deaf. It is a day program, not residential. It has a great community aspect but does not expect kids to live on campus.

Maryland school for the deaf has elementary in Columbia which is very nice place to live. Then a highschool in Fredrick (maybe 30 ish minutes away from Columbia) and then Gallaudet University is just train ride away in DC!

Colorado has some very good schools. Heard good things about Rocky Mountain deaf school

New Mexico School for the Deaf is great. My mom went there then came back and taught there until she retired.

I have a middle schooler at the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf and I’d be happy to answer any questions you have if you want to DM me. My kid was mainstreamed initially but PSD has been absolutely wonderful for us.

As a deaf individual of hearing parents who went through a similar approach years ago, you’re doing all the right things here!

1odadfw,deaf,Positive experience with iPod 3 Pro earbuds as hearing aids,"I have moderate hearing loss and have worn hearing aids for about 5 years now. I was recently gifted iPod pro 3 earbuds for my birthday and set up the hearing aid function (first with the audiogram that I used for my hearing aids, and then by using the built in apple hearing test. ) I have to say that I'm really impressed. They're not perfect, but at 1/10th the cost of dedicated hearing aids, I find them a great option. I'm currently checking with my medical benefits provider (BCBS of MA) to see if they qualify for reimbursement under the hearing aid benefit.

Pros:

* Easy setup with audiogram or hearing test
* excellent enhancement for general conversation
* good enhancement in noisy / busy conditions
* Fast recharge time
* MUCH easier to clean and keep from getting gummed up with earwax
* Much less likely to make my ear canals itch
* Excellent for use with videoconferencing (I work remotely and use zoom all day)
* 1/10th the cost of ""medical"" hearing aids
* They switch seamlessly between audio sources and hearing aid function

Cons

* Not great in windy conditions (they pick up a lot of wind noise)
* Battery life is limited to about 7-8 hours of continuous use
* they're visible to everyone - (interestingly, I find this doesn't bother me as much as I expected)
* They sometimes get confused about what sounds to focus on if there's a lot of background noise (ie: talking, radio / background music, road noise, wind noise)

This isn't an endorsement for Apple or any of it's products.  I just wanted to share my experience in the hopes that maybe someone who might not be able to drop a couple grand on hearing aids might find this alternative more affordable and useful. I'm happy to answer any questions about my experience in the thread.

\*\*Edit 2025-10-24\*\*  
I got a response from my healthcare provider, and as I suspected, earpods are not covered by my insurance.(despite being approved by the FDA as hearing aid devices) Oh well, they're still a lot less expensive than full priced hearing aids. 

[댓글]
HH with moderate to profound hearing loss here - I found that they left me completely spent after wearing them, they allow so much background noise in that it was very overwhelming. I work in a loud environment though, so that’s where I was using them. 
I think in quieter settings they would work much better. And do agree the amplification and range is pretty great especially considering the cost.

The way Apple has integrated hearing test calibration and adaptive sound control is genuinely impressive for people with mild to moderate loss. When I was buying I had to choose between AirPods 2 Pro or Nova hearing aids from HearDirectclub, I didn't like the tech on AirPods 2 and I am glad that they've improved their tech.

I have read elsewhere that they're 'geo-fenced', as in they don't function as hearing aids outside of certain political boundaries, based presumably on GPS position. Perhaps because of the fuzzy medical equipment boundaries, too.

Yes this was very helpful. I’ve been curious to see how others have used these specific products.",2025-10-22 14:49:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1odadfw/positive_experience_with_ipod_3_pro_earbuds_as/

1oczph2,deaf,Blind and now with hearing loss.,"I discovered this recently. One of my biggest fears over the last few years has come true, and I still haven't been able to shed a tear — something I've done a lot of just with the possibility of going blind. A possibility that was also just a fear and also became reality.

I was 13 when I discovered I could go blind; Today I'm 21. Maybe I've gotten used to trauma, I don't know.

The ENT said I won't need hearing aids for now, but I'm sad that I probably won't be able to use in-ear devices. Despite everything, I still hope to be able to lead as normal a life as possible...

Thanks, guys, and sorry if this isn't the best sub to post this.

Profoundly deaf here.  That’s pretty mild. You’ll be ok for a long time.   Mine starts at 110 dB @ .5 Hz and gets worse from there.

This is mild hearing loss. Not recoverable but you can totally live a good life with it. Just be aware of music and loud noises in your day to day. Sometimes im shocked im not profoundly deaf because my music is typically loud screamo

Some of us with far worse hearing loss (I have 105db at the bottom) get along pretty fine with HAs. The BTE ones with ear molds can handle pretty severe amplification (that's what I have). Sorry about your vision. My wife has glaucoma; we joke that together we make one human (I can see, she can hear).

I have Keratoconus which is very extreme blurred vision as of a few years ago and have been Profoundly Deaf all my life. 
However I don't let it get to me, I adapt and advocate (don't get me wrong, it gets exhausting fast) but I feel like it's one of these things where I, myself have to get on with it otherwise I'll just spiral. 
Also had been dealing with andeoymosis on top of that too. (And being neurodivergent!)

Looks like you have a high frequency moderate hearing loss in both ears. Pretty much normal hearing overall with a moderate hearing loss to very high pitch/frequency sounds. I can see why they would not recommend hearing aids. 

This is not a significant hearing loss; you will be fine. I hope it does not get worse or progress.

Try r/DeafBlind for support. DeafBlind people live amazing, full lives. I’ve known a couple who are just wonderful people. Things will change but it doesn’t mean you need to despair.

Hey, I'm really sorry you're going through this. I think it's great that you're being proactive about your hearing and thinking ahead even though your ENT said you don't need HAs right now. When or if you ever do need assistance down the line, there are accessible and comfortable in-ear options out there that can fit a wide range of needs. My FIL is using audien ion pro that's designed for mild to moderate hearing loss. For now, you're doing the right thing by taking care of yourself and staying on top of it.

If you do need hearing aids down the line, do some research on battery powered v rechargable. I wear mine a lot and the rechargable battery life wasn't long enough with my TikTok addiction

How many of us also deal with vision issues alongside?
Shhh we aren’t suppose to ask or gather that data or find clusters of talk to attorneys shhhh

Luckily you’re in the mild meaning hearing aids should benefit you very well. I’m sorry you lost your hearing though.

If your loss is mild then you may find that hearing aids are not that useful. 
However, if you get them set up a program for o and m. Make sure that you can hear the direction of sounds and that speech is not automatically focused on.
 You want to be able to hear background noises and the direction of them when you are analizing a street-crossing.

hey, dealing with both vision and hearing stuff sounds really tough but you're handling it way better than I probably would. the mild hearing loss thing is what everyone else said but honestly? maybe this is a good excuse to finally cut back on the endless scrolling that probably isn't helping your mental health anyway. have you thought about using this as motivation to build some healthier habits while you're adapting to everything else?

Surely if we go as a deaf group they will have to put accessibility support in place for us?  If no one fancies going does anyone have experience attending and what they did to support you?

[댓글]
Regarding not hearing back: reach out again.  

Occam's razor on a non-response to an accessibility request is the first person who read the email goes ""Oh I don't know how to handle this I should ask my manager"" and then they forgot.

It's my experience that frequent polite emails (like every week, or even more frequent) until resolution is not only helpful but often necessary.

Also: don't ask; tell.  Most hearing people have no idea what we need.  Tell them straight out what they need to do to enable your participation.  Do you want instructions in writing?  Or a BSL interpreter?  CART?  Etc.  Make it concrete.  When you leave it abstract and open-ended ""how do you accommodate deaf people?"" most hearing people blank out mentally at that point.  It's such a broad issue that they have no idea where to even begin and if you're lucky they'll ruminate on it for a bit and then go ""I unno?"" and if you're unlucky they won't even think about it and you'll get a reflexive ""we can't?""

Damn, I'm just watching the celeb one with my partner now and *yes 100% I'd be down!*

Not sure how to go about finding enough people or what steps would be next but I'm on board.

1oc0aiw,deaf,Question for tty relay operators,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I see that sometimes Relay Operators post on this sub. I have difficulty speaking, not deaf, so that's why I use relay. but I have a question - sometimes the person I'm calling talks about me in 3rd person to the operator (which is annoying but anyways) and they use my correct pronouns even tho I haven't used my name or any indicator of what my gender is.. how do they know what my gender is? Can relay operators see what number I'm calling from and also remember me (and therefore when explaining how to use relay use my pronouns)? Or just a weird guess? Maybe based on the relay operator's voice? 

[댓글]
Relay operators are usually women, so the hearing person may make an assumption. The VA gets tripped up when they hear a woman’s voice say “this is (male first name) speaking” when I call. 

There’s a setting somewhere about whether or not the relay is announced to the person you’re calling. If the hearing person calls you,  then they know it’s a relay call. 

I’m not sure if the operator knows your name and address. I know they can get it in case it’s an emergency call. I just don’t know if that info is easily available. If you use VRS, of course the interpreter can see what gender you present. 

Relay operators remembering your number and gender is probably the least likely scenario. I’ve had phone calls where the operator doesn’t remember what I said 2 minutes ago.

I believe possibly caller id?

1ob61i6,deaf,Is it hard to watch TV with captions?,"This is a very odd question of mine, but I’m a current ASL student and my teacher mentioned how sign language is different from English or other spoken languages. I also know that some companies have sign language interpreters for tv shows/movies. Is it easier to watch someone sign the lines or are captions easy? I also ask this because I would imagine how difficult it must be for deaf children trying to learn signing and a written language. (I don’t know if written language is the correct term.) 

[댓글]
It is very easy for me to watch television with captions, because I've been doing it for a very long time.  I also consider myself strongly proficient in English, as it was my first language.

That said, if I have the choice of watching ASL interpreted television or movies, I'll choose that over closed captions 100% of the time, provided that the media is being interpreted by a fluent Deaf person.  Some captions attempt to implement little tricks with the style and formatting to indicate things like who's speaking when conversation overlaps, or to guide tone through the use of brackets.  But consider which is better: reading that something is meant to be intoned sarcastically through text on the screen, or seeing it for yourself in the signer's expression and body language?  There's a richness of experience that gets lost in simple captions alone.

ASL is my first language but I prefer captions. I feel watching interp takes you away from screen action. I can read captions faster than the interp finishing the complete sentence.

To answer your question... No, it's not that hard to watch TV with captions but it is kinda hard to watch TV with ""in screen"" interpreter. Had to split my eyes in two opposing way. 

And at the movie theater, it definitely hard to watch big silver screen with detachable caption device. Had to split my eyes into two different vertically way. 

I preferred OG caption on TV. 

Oh, right, I almost forgot to mentioned... Most video games also can be captioned but not all have same font and size... Making it much harder to read!

If you can watch subbed anime then you can watch anything with caption

This is a very individualized question. It will be easy for most Deaf who had strong English, grew up oral, are not Deaf immigrants or foreigners just learning the language the captions are in, and who don't have other disabilities that make it harder to read the captions to do it. But 50% of the deaf people have another disability, mand cultural Deaf people are using English as a second language to various levels of fluency, language deprivation is common in the Deaf community, and for ASL specifically many Deaf from other countries immigrate to the US and Canada for more opportunities not available at home. Young children who can't read yet and are just learning also do not understand captions well.

That leads to a large number of people who may potentially struggle or burn out on reading captions way more than ASL.

Think of it as the difference between being read to versus reading. There are some situations where one or the other is an advantage but most hearing people do not want to read something, particularly not for hours at a time and would prefer to listen in many situations.

It depends on many things. Esp literacy skills.

Deaf here, sign language as my first language historically. Not able to lip read or speak myself. 

I prefer text as I’m more comfortable reading than watching signing.

But this is me, I’m one person. I can’t speak for everyone. The preferences is a vast spectrum.

I really hope your ASL teacher doesn’t just “mention” that there’s a difference between signed and spoken languages. 

Children grow up bilingual all the time. It’s no different for deaf children learning ASL and English.

For me, I can't remember a time I didn't use captions. It's my normal. 
I think it varies  based on personal  preference. I was raised oral with a hearing family. 
Where is someone who is raised with ASL, could have a different preference.

Rap music videos and I remember Brie Larson speaking quick in Captain Marvel being tough but otherwise, no.

Sharing my insight on your question, which I appreciate the purpose of the question (from my interpretation to your question) is basically the nature of the Deaf individual’s first language in ASL and how captions differ from the language they’re spoken/written in vs. the language of “Deaf speak”/ASL as primary/first language is read/decoded as information delivered through closed captions (hopefully i got this interpretation of your question correct and if so, then):

I know some Deaf individuals W/ ASL as their primary language would follow along with the information that’s captioned for them but in some ways (like I would do), sometimes focus on the keywords/words that i can understand and then put it together like a puzzle along with utilizing any visual information that isn’t captioned to help tie in what’s being said and why it’s being shown on visual media and sometimes I would reach out to other individuals who can fill me in on the gaps i missed or clarify anything i misunderstood or misinterpreted from the captioned visual media

If taught well, it’s not a problem at all for anyone to learn several languages. You just need a great sign language environment so that the children really get enough language exposure to thrive and develop the language. Then it’s not difficult at all to learn the written language just like anyone else. Parents and teachers can use the sign language to explain how the written language works. You only have to consider that the children don’t get the exposure tonspoken language just as much as hearing children. You need to fully understand that and adapt to it. 

The mistake often made, if focusing on speech and listening- which isn’t fully acceptable to people with any hearing loss, regardless hearing aids or CI. This causes many children not to have full access to any language, and in some cases lead to language deprivation, having a really good sign language environment is essential for language development.

In my country captions are very common and frequently used even by hearing people. We even have open captions in the cinema. Captions are convenient, because you can just glance at them using your peripheral vision, without being distracted from the content. A sign language interpreter is different. You need to pay much more attention, since there are many more details to take in from facial expression, body language and the signing in general. This means some Deaf would prefer captions if there is a lot of visual content in the film they don’t want to miss. On the other hand, if there is a lot of speech, signing can convey many more details about how things are said than captions. Signing will also be better if someone isn’t a good reader. Remember how not all Deaf had access to teachers who really know how to teach reading and writing to someone who doesn’t hear.

It’s easy for me but I read very fast. I also can read lips which along with subtitles work really well for me. I been heard of hearing most of my life- 35 now. I can only watch movies or tv with subtitles if I want it understand it. 

I know some people hate it but that’s just life for me. Captions are turned on in all my streaming apps automatically. I believe it is matter of practice.

A lot of people here haven’t mentioned that there are some Deaf people who can’t read or write, and also have better literacy skills in sign rather than English.

I don’t use sign language but I do use captioning and it’s usually pretty accurate for movies and streaming. Using a phone or tablet device for automatic speech recognition captions though is a whole other story. The device needs to be near the speaker and there can be no background sound to get accurate captions, and even then it usually misses the same words that I miss with my Hearing Loss.

from what I've been taught by a deaf coworker, there is Sign Language English and English. Sign language English is less grammatically correct to what someone who is hearing will know, and most deaf people (according to my coworker) don't know very many words over six letters.

No. Captions are my life I can’t understand any sort of media without captions. I can hear it even with my hearing loss but I can’t understand it for some reason.

Just to add that it's not hard to watch TV with captions.
Our brain adjusts to things very quickly, and reading the text, whilst watching the picture, is something the brain finds easy to do.

What is difficult, is the fact that captions are on a scale of great, to absolutely terrible.
If they're auto generated, they will often be a mess, with lots of mistakes, random letters here and there.
YT captions are an example of this.
The issue they have, is that whilst a video may be mostly in one language, let's take English as an example, the real world is full of different languages, and we use words and terms from other languages a lot.
English is especially used here and there by many non English speakers, just because it's become so prevalent, mainly by force.
And really, the main issue is names. We don't just use normal names online, we use user names, and there are so many terms used online that aren't really normal words.
YT seems to have gone the route of trying to accommodate that, by trying to guess at what someone is saying if it doesn't recognise it as the native language. But, this is a problem, because it often doesn't recognise the native language. Audio issues, someone not speaking very clearly, background noise, just randomly the system not picking things up, and it misses part of a word. So it thinks it isn't an English word. But it knows names are a thing, so it just makes up random stuff based on the few syllables it did pick up on.
That's why you'll just get random capitalised letters in the middle of a segment sentence, and miss out words.
It's quite a bad system. You will never fully get what's said.
I'm pretty sure the big issue on YT are because they've designed the system to accommodate names, and Internet culture. So now it just can't do any of it very well.

This is an issue for live captions in more traditional media, like TV, too. Though I've not really seen the random letters here and there on TV. Whether that's because they stick only to the words of the language, or they have someone run through it to make sure it's not just random rubbish, whilst it's going out, I don't know.

Even human typed subs can be wrong though.
There is so much TV and films, where the subs will miss out words, or use a different word, and it changes the whole meaning of a sentence, and can change the whole meaning of the plot.

Oh, he did this stupid thing because he loved her, and didn't want to lose her? No, he did this thing because he was obsessed with her, and thought she shouldn't be allowed out of his sight.
(A rather extreme example of what can happen)

This happens because the subs are generated from the script at first, and then tidied up to fit the timing.
But it seems the script is sent fairly early in the process, and changes are made during filming. And changes made during filming can be extreme. We've probably all heard of films where the director has changed their mind part way through, and changed the whole thing.
So in this method of creating subs, meaning is often lost.
They'll also shorten sentences a lot. I'm guessing someone thinks we can't read quickly enough. Probably because they can't, so they can't comprehend the idea of DeafHOH people being able to read faster. But the thing about brain adaptation, is that you do learn to read that quickly whilst reading subs.
So we get subs that are abbreviated, and have incorrect wording, that can change the meaning of a sentence, and therefore a scene, or even the whole thing.
And they very often remove swear words. Because apparently we're children to them.
(This is a thing that genuinely makes me angry. Hearing people are allowed to hear the swear word, but 'the poor Deafs need to be protected!' it's seriously disgusting.)

Most live tv subs are delayed, which is another issue. Quite a big issue really. Especially if you have hearing.
I can hear sound above average. I have a processing disorder.
This means I'm hearing things being said, but that's not what's in the subs. I struggle with that quite a bit.
And even if you don't have hearing, the video has moved on by the time the subs appear.
You can be reading the subs, say in a TV program with anticipation of some kind, but the video shows the pay off, and ruins the surprise.
Conversely, the subs often ruin the surprise, because rather than properly time then to what's happening, in a way that makes sense, they'll just put a whole sentence up at a time.
So if you're watching comedy, you'll get the punch line early.
If you're watching a quiz, you might lose time to guess.
If you're watching a gritty crime drama, and they're at the big reveal scene, and it's laid out perfectly, timed so that the reveal happens at a certain moment... Well tough. You got that 15s early, and the perfectly timed video, and tense acting, was ruined.
You might not feel that that's so bad, but when you watch it, it becomes obvious why it's a problem.

Eh, there's a lot more, but this is too long.

To put it shortly; the act of reading subs is simple.
The quality of subs is appalling. And that's what makes it difficult.
It's the same issue that all accessibility has. It's a good solution, but they don't care to do it well enough.

It's like that perfectly sloped ramp, not too steep, not too shallow. A good width, smooth surface.
And at the top, the door opens onto the ramp, so you end up having to go back onto the ramp itself to open the door, which means you're struggling to not roll back down it, whilst pulling a heavy door open, and trying to get through.
The ramp itself looks really good.
The implementation is useless.

 I can't comment on signed, as I haven't yet learnt BSL, so I don't watch signed TV.

No it’s not hard but o prefer to have interpreters on the screen and I often do

i cant speak on it in the way youre asking because english was my first language. however, imagine if all of the information you got was through reading. its way better to have access to visual language than reading, just like its way easier to listen to something than read for hearing loss

This is a question that I come across a lot - the thing about accessibility, is it's not 'this is best' - accessibility is a very personal journey for many people. Some people prefer sign, some people prefer captions - it depends on lifestage of hearing loss, personal preference, etc. 

I work in live events, where they're often trying to find the 'one solution' when really the gold standard is to provide both. People can opt-in to what they find works best. 

Its great to see another ASL Interpreter start their journey - demand is high, and will remain so, for quite some time. Your support is vital. 

The other way to look at captions is that they're also used for translation.",2025-10-20 00:38:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ob61i6/is_it_hard_to_watch_tv_with_captions/
1ob2j46,deaf,Deaf events: Closed or open to hearing ASL learners?,"Apologies if I’m intruding into a subreddit where I don’t belong. As you can see by the flair, I was born hearing, but I fell in love with ASL and Deaf culture this past year and have tried to immerse myself as much as possible.
On a different subreddit, one user told me the best way to improve my communication skills and continue appreciating the culture was to attend Deaf events. However, I don’t want to be *that* hearing person and stick myself into a community where I don’t belong. 

How do I know which Deaf events are open to hearing signers (especially those who are not fluent yet)? Furthermore, how do I express my love and appreciation for ASL/Deaf culture without sounding like I’m weirdly obsessive in the wrong way?

[댓글]
It depends. Sometimes the flier will say “students welcome”. When in doubt, just message the event organizer and ask. The biggest thing is to respect Deaf spaces. Voice off. A coffee or beach social should be fine. 

The only time you’re likely to run into trouble is if you’re taking a seat from a Deaf person at an interpreted event. Theatres and concert venues will sometimes have a discounted ticket and limited space in the interpreter area. Those seats are for Deaf and their guests only.

What events are you interested in? You can often  look up ahead of time and write the event organizers online. 

Just ask in advance if it's open to ASL students. 

We have an event newsletter at my school or ASL department that has them color coded for Learners, intermediate,  And Deaf only. 

I went to an ASL festival yesterday that stated it was open to all. 
I would just ask ahead.

Others have given you great advice. 

To your last question I’ll add, you will be asked by deaf people why you’re interested in ASL, and they may not be perfectly polite about it. That’s not personal, it’s due to a bad history of hearing people trying to convert deaf people to religion or other kinds of ugly ulterior motives. 

If you let people know you just love the language and realize you want to learn more about the community, I don’t think you can go wrong, especially at a mixed deaf/hearing event.

Hearing not welcome will include ""Deaf only"" for event.

1oaxgl2,deaf,Question about name signs and the deaf community,"Hi just for context I consider myself hard of hearing. I have severe hearing loss in my left ear and mild hearing loss in my right from a head injury when I was a freshman in high school. I wear hearing aids and I am learning ASL. I just started learning more about the deaf community a couple years ago and want to be involved! However it’s difficult to find my place in it. I didn’t grow up in deaf culture so I feel like an outsider. But my question today is would it be wrong for me to make up name signs? I know it’s important for a deaf person to give a name sign and I got mine from a deaf friend. But, while trying to use ASL in my day to day, I think it would be useful to give my girlfriend a name sign as well as our dogs. What do you guys think?

[댓글]
They must be given by someone who is a native or fluent user of ASL, and DHH. I know right away when I meet someone if their name sign was given by someone who is not fluent or hearing. I’ve met people who proudly i introduce themselves with name signs meaning “guilty”, “jealous”, and “lazy”. If you’re not fluent, there’s no way to know what meaning you’re assigning to people

This comes up a billion times a week, it feels like. No. You can’t give yourself a sign name. It must be given to you.

&gt;I didn’t grow up in deaf culture so I feel like an outsider. 

This is why you can’t give yourself a name sign. An “insider” must.

You risk giving yourself something racist. 

Just go to Deaf events and interact make  friends. You'll earn one in no time.

I'm late Deaf and learning ASL. 
 Got my first 2 sign names a few weeks ago. 
One from my Deaf best friend and one from a friend in an ASL meet-up. 

It's probably because my name is long as hell. And annoying to spell. 

Best to learn about Deaf culture and the history of ASL before   worrying about if you have a sign name. 


Sign names are gifts from Deaf people. I've never heard of a Deaf person giving themselves a sign name. 
I was taught it's a gift from another Deaf person.


 I think feeling connected to Deaf culture comes from showing up, learning, and respecting the space. I study ASL history, Deaf etiquette, and support Deaf creators. When I go to events, I stay voice-off, sign as best I can, and let people know I’m learning.

 Most people will meet you halfway if they see you making the effort.
Look up local Deaf events for new signers in your area.

Why is the name sign such a big deal in ASL? In SVK (finland) you get it when you are around deaf people enough to need one.

Go talk with your audiologist. If your speech recognition score is already too low, HAs aren't going to change that for you. The AI HAs just reduce background noise, they don't make voices sound any different. Maybe you're a good candidate for implants?

The AI Oticons have been life-changing for me. I have severe-to-profound hearing loss.

1oaj0fk,deaf,Experiencing Partial Deafness growing up&amp;only realizing it in the last 5 years,"I damaged the internal organs of my left ear back when I was a kid, either from the pressure of untrained freediving or a hit I got to my ear during martial arts, I genuinely forgot which. I did feel my hearing deteriorating back then but I heard that it's normal that one ear has better hearing than the other, so I let it be.  

Growing up not knowing your partially deaf is so frustrating, unfortunately I grew up in a society where disability awareness lacks incredibly. People still make fun of it.  I just came to realize how much pressure I put on myself for not catching up on talks with my friends or for not hearing when I'm called. I'd be made fun of—I'd be called something along the lines of deafy deaf—and people would get frustrated at me thinking I'm slow in the brain (which technically another lack of awareness in a different field). 

It affected me so much as a person. I end up preferring being in a small social setting so I could hear everyone, I exhaust myself mentally cause I would pressure myself to hear somebody talk from one go cause surprise-surprise people get frustrated from having to repeat themselves twice. 

In a way I think it would be different if I was aware and as a result people around me know I have a disability from the beginning, but still it doesn't justify their actions. 

Upon realizing, I am still so sad and angry. I feel like I want to go up to their faces and be like ""I'm partially deaf you morons, but thanks for the insult! Really shows the kind of morality you have!"" 

I guess I'm venting because I don't want this anger to overrule me, cause it's so not worth it to lash out. Plus the people that does that to me, are still around me, they're family and friends. They're great people in other aspects, but I don't know how will I come to terms with what they did to me back then.

You were a kid. You didn’t have the maturity to handle this level of hearing loss, how to correct it, see a doctor about it get hearing aids for. Hell you probably did even know how to find a doctor in the phone book. 

Society sucks for people with disabilities. But don’t layer emotions and spiral. Just acknowledge it and carry on and do it with a big smile.

1o9ma10,deaf,Future audiologist seeking advice!!,"Hello! My name is Madalyn and I am currently a 3rd year doctor of audiology student! 

Little bit of backstory:
I am hearing but I want to be fluent in ASL. I think it’s very important as a future audiologist and I just love the language. I took some Deaf culture and ASL classes in undergrad but unfortunately that was right when covid hit. Everything was moved online and it became really hard learning ASL. I know some signs but I’m not fluent, which is my goal.

My current clinical placement has a Deaf game night once a month that I attend (super fun) and it’s made me realize that I need to get back into learning sign language. I found that Lifeprint with Bill Vicars (love him) has a nice online ASL course with YouTube videos. I just finished lesson 1 and it was so helpful, I love the way he teaches. So I’m going to continue that and try to finish the full four classes course. 

My question is… where do you suggest I learn signs that are audiology specific. Such as explaining instructions, results, info about hearing aids/cochlear implants, etc. Disclaimer!!!! I know I would need an interpreter if I am not 100% fluent in ASL. I think that even if I’m not fluent yet, it’s still better to know some signs rather than none. I think that this should just be a part of audiology curriculum but sadly it’s not. So I’d greatly appreciate any advice on audiology signs or just becoming fluent in ASL!! Thanks in advance!

[댓글]
I’d find other audiologists who can sign and ask them. You may need to find an association or group that helps you connect with audiologists. 

Other options would be finding signing SLPs familiar with audiology terms or fluent ASL users who see audiologists often and asking them for signs.

My biggest audiologist / audiology office pet peeve: STOP CALLING YOUR PATIENTS, FOR FUCKS SAKE. There's got to be a better way to notify your patients, and I'm tired of offices hiding behind HIPAA to deny us that accommodation.  

Anyways good luck with your studies and thanks for asking :)

There are D/deaf audiologists! Connecting with them may be a good place to start

Hey there. 

As a person who has cochlear implants and is native in ASL, I want to tell you that I appreciate you for your enthusiasm in learning our language! 

 I can't really say that I would know how to point you to specific resources about learning audiology-related signs. 

But what I can tell you is that just by learning ASL by itself will easily lend you a way to communicate with your ASL-based clients. 

ASL is, obviously, a highly visual language. So just by learning the language itself will help you to understand how you can communicate with your ASL-based deaf clients better. Once you get an intuition on how we rely on visual gesture to describe things, that will help you unlock your secret on how to communicate to people like us. 

Please do check out the LingVano app. 

I can't give you an opinion on that app because I don't use it. I never use any ASL-teaching sources because I'm a native user in ASL. I don't need to be taught on how to use a language that I've already mastered when I was a child. 

However, I've heard a lot in my community about this app. I'm pretty comfortable with vouching for it. 

That app is just like Bill Vicars. I've only seen a few of his stuff. His stuff is spot on as far as I can tell. I don't watch his vlogs regularly because, like what I said, I have no need to learn my own native language. But I do know that Bill's vlogs are widely used in our community as a basic ASL education tool. 

I hope this is helpful. And good luck! We need more people like you in our world! 

P.S. 

If you check my post history, you'll see I've been posting a lot of stuff about the deaf community. I have a lot of perspectives to offer. If you want to take a dive into our community, my posts are there for your reading!

I appreciate you, 

Helen Scarlett

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

first of all thank you for learning .. ALL of the audiologists in my area cant even fingerspell and wont even try .. So they no longer conduct word recognition testing on me at all :(  also i hope you dont mind but if you find a source for audiology related signs .. please let me know / share ... i would love to learn them.

I’m Deaf and also a doctor of audiology student (2nd year)! Honestly, there are many terms in audiology that are so specific, that my interpreters for class and I just make up a sign and use it consistently. But there are definitely some established signs out there for many concepts. 

I am currently in my placement at my local Deaf school. It may be helpful to reach out to your local Deaf school audiologist, they may be able to guide you! Also, I know there are some STEM sign dictionaries out there, I have not looked through all of them but maybe some signs you are looking for are there. 
https://atomichands.com/asl-stem-dictionaries/

It may also help to look for a local ASL tutor and do a private lesson for you to go over specific signs that maybe are not covered in normal ASL class.

My biggest tip, learn how to explain the concept in ASL rather than looking for a specific sign for complex terms. Often your Deaf patient has not seen or heard that term before. Sometimes there is language deprivation. This is how we counsel with Deaf families at my placement. For example if I want to say a patient has ANSD, I might sign “Ear itself work fine. But understand nerve damage happen. Mean ear brain disconnect.” Or something like that. Visually demonstrate auditory system pathway with signs and gestures if necessary, using my own head or body. Then when I have explained, I can introduce spelling “ANSD” or “AUDITORY NEUROPATHY.” Every patient/family is different and can require different approach.

It can take some practice if you are not used to it, but building your general ASL vocabulary enough can help you communicate most concepts. Good luck!

Ask deaf people. We all go to audiologists

You were admitted to the hospital because of... hearing aids?

If I understand you correctly, you tried to get SSDI. It's hard to get on disability for just deafness. Easier if you have vertigo, too. Lots of deaf people work, the tech is pretty good, maybe try everything except hearing aids if you don't like them. I can see why the judge is suggesting hearing aids, you'll probably be forced to get them. You haven't proved you can't work yet, even if you think you can't, the judge is saying you haven't tried everything.

Please provide more info and context.  Looks like you're in Florida, what do you mean the gov wants you to get heading aids? What the fuck do they think it's going to do for you? 


I lost my hearing (also sensorineural loss) a little too quickly to ever get good results from hearing aids. I did have one for my good ear for a couple of years though (~20 years ago) it was a little helpful until the limited range of frequencies I could hear went into profound range as well. I had to ""try"" a hearing aid as part of my CI evaluation last year. It didn't do fuck all for my ""good"" ear. 


So, in short, wtf are you talking about? Your options are a CI or an ABR, or just living without. I was profoundly deaf for nearly 10 years before I got my CI, so can totally understand if you didn't want one.

As others have said, your question isn't specific enough to answer perfectly. I have sensorineural deafness with moderate to profound attenuation on both ears starting in my early 60s. Hearing aids are absolutely necessary for me to function at all. But you can turn the volume up or down on HAs (I don't knwo about CIs) with an app on your phone. I can completely mute them as well. With my HAs, I can deal with people in an admittedly imperfect fashion as I have to augment with lip reading and it requires a good environment. Nevertheless, it's some level of hearing function compared to when my aids are out, people would have to get right up to my face and speak in a very loud voice for me to understand anything at all.

I have sensorineural hearing loss and I’ve had hearing aids for the past 5 years with no problems other than a killer headache for the first few days while my brain adjusts. I highly recommend speaking to your audiologist about your concerns!!!

I’m a facilities maintenance technician here’s the way I understand this problem,
Hearing aids along with any hearing devices can have crazy effects if not adjusted properly. They can’t turn my cochlear implant to its intended target yet three months after my surgery because my brain can’t handle the extra noise. The brain is an electrical system. The cochlea is essentially a transducer device that converts sounds into electrical signals and sends those signals back to the brain for the brain to process the signal into understandable sound. Now when an electrical signal is stronger than its rated transducer it can cause serious malfunctions including failure. Your hearing aids are increasing the signal to a far greater signal than your cochlea can currently handle. Turning down your hearing aids or wearing them for a short period of time will allow you to properly adjust to your hearing aids.",2025-10-18 02:36:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o9kd8r/sensioneural_deafness_and_hearing_aids_anyone/
1o9cvp4,deaf,"I am a 21M, want to vent, Sorry I might go deep.","I am a 21M, want to vent, Sorry I might go deep.

I am 100% deaf on my right ear and I have been living with mono hearing since my childhood.  
Backstory - I am not sure what caused my hearing loss, but I have two incidents in mind that are highly likely to. Back when I was around 3 to 4 years old, I suffered a very high fever, and I was told that I was given high dosage of injection to reduce my fever and that might have caused my internal nerve damage.  
(little about my condition - I can't hear on my right side and I have went to multiple hospitals for checkup and they said it's not treatable the nerve that carries the sound information is damaged and it can't be repaired I have to live with one ear for the rest of my life and honestly it doesn't even matter now I have been living like this for 15+ years I don't even know how long).  
And another reason might be the accident - When I was around 6 I was hit by a motorcycle, and the point of impact was back of my head, and I suppose that might have caused the trauma.

I have never told anyone about my condition during my whole schooling years except one guy I remember telling and it ended up really ugly, we were best friends and he would use to tease me by calling me deaf over and over again and he would use to murmur on my bad side on purpose so he can later joke about what he said and I don't even know. It was not his fault, we were child and immature then and he didn't know how his actions impacted me and made me more scared to share it any further. To this day I have only    two more friends who knows about my condition and I am grateful they were really supportive to me and treated me normally as any other person, but this feeling always eats me up when I am in part of a crowd or Whenever I am on a dining table with my colleagues the whole time I am as attentive as a cat to not miss anyone calling on me and it is really exhausting, when I finish my dining it feels like an achievement to hold a conversation without anyone noticing anything and it goes for 3 times in a day (I live in a hostel with my batchmates),   
I am tired of always being on the right of everyone,  
I am tired of always asking people to give me the corner seat without being courageous to answer ""why""  
I am tired of people asking me to give a try on their brand-new headphones (Bro I have never in my life felt what spatial audio is like, I just pretend omg that's so good)  
I am tired of explaining others that I was not attentive enough when they were calling me but in reality, their voices never reached me.  
I am just so tired living like this it feels annoying at this point, it's not like I am depressed or sad or something it's just really a kind of a Burdon on my chest.  
Sorry this is going too far, I just wanted to vent somewhere. I might feel good after telling everyone and I don't have to keep it to myself forever.

(it's so annoying when my friend can spot enemy with sound in pubg but I just can't lol)

Overall, the only good side of it is I can sleep peacefully being cut off from the world.

Sounds like you are feeling ashamed of it and needing to hide it, but you might be surprised how most adults don't care and/or are compassionate about it. It won't be like in school.

Vent away, friend. Would you like any advice?

My story is long, (so, TL;DR, I guess) but mostly because I'm older than you (I'm 56 now). Being deaf in one ear isn't great and there's a bit of disconnect to being ""deaf"" because while we ARE deaf, we might feel that we're not ""deaf enough""- except, ***we are***. I hate knowing that people like us are having such a hard time with our normalcy. It's okay and it will be okay. Venting is good, and if you want- this is my deaf ear story: 

I was born deaf in my right ear. I don't have a cochlear nerve in that ear and we were told my left ear may have a damaged one (because I was mildly hard-of-hearing in that ear as a child. I am very HoH in that ear now). 

I had no qualms telling people about it. How were they going to know that I couldn't hear them if I didn't tell them? I was mainstreamed through school and every first day of class, I had to give my teacher(s) my little speech about needing to be to the right of the class and/or in the front row. Out of the 12+ years of schooling, only three teachers ever had a problem with it (one was my second grade teacher and two were my 9th grade history teacher and 9th grade math teacher).  I just blurt it out now- ""You're on my deaf side"". 

And about your childhood friend being a jerk- that IS absolutely his fault. He chose to behave that way, you didn't make him behave that way. My worst person was my own brother. He found out that I was learning to read lips and started speaking through clenched teeth. He's 58 and the last time I saw him (in 2013), he was STILL doing it (but he didn't know he was doing it, he's just been doing it so long that's just how he talks).  But he did things like your friend did- mumbling, using my deafness against me, tried to get me in trouble with my parents by saying they said yes or whatever to something we wanted to do when they hadn't. 

I'm an event photographer and the people who work on cast/crew at the event where I work all know about my deafness. They make a point to approach me on my hearing side, or they'll call out to me but say my whole name and which side they're on (I have a  hearing aid now, so sound all goes to one ear). Your friends and colleagues should be able to muster that much decency to handle that information. 

My favorite technology thing is that our smartphones can be set to ""mono"" for media, then we can hear all of the music through both headphones/earbuds. (obviously, just needing the left one). I use ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as my ""test"" song when I get a new phone to make sure it's on the mono setting (because of how the music is split between both sides in ""stereo"").

You need to accept your hearing loss. Get professional support from audiologists, counselors and other HoH out there. You’re definitely not the only one. Accept that you don’t hear well, be honest to people about it and find your own way to love with poor hearing. There is nothing wrong at all with you, besides the hearing. Don’t accept not being valued for all things you actually can and do contribute with.

I had a “friend” call me special needs when we were 9. I just wore a hearing aid, I don’t know why kids are so mean. I’ve never been that mean to anyone when I was a kid or at any point in my life.

It feels like I am reading about myself. The only difference is I got this around the end of my schooling days and it is for both ears. I have carried the shame in the initial years. I have been called names. But trust me, once you come out open to everyone, they don't really care.  Even I don't know how i got this deafness, and I also have exact same theory, I was in high fever once and I was also in road accident. Slowly the hearing power decreased without I could even guess, what is happening. You are ashamed of yourself but I envy you coz you got hearing power on one side.

However, I am in a good position in my life now. Got a doctorate in science. Married to the love of my life, and father of a beautiful girl (I feared my deafness is genetic and what if it is got to child too. Fortunately, it was not genetic and my daughter is great and cute). I advise you not to be ashamed of your nature. I used to tell myself, ""the only way to exit is through"". 

PS: On a different note, I feel like you are an Indian! Are you? Plz don't take this wrong. In case you are and looking for career guidance, do ping me. I have helped a few differentially abled people to get into govt jobs and studies.

It seems like you’re doing all of this not only because of what you experienced from your friend when you were younger but also because you don’t accept yourself as you are. Sounds like it is time to start working on accepting yourself. I mean all of you. Even the parts that you think are flaws and all which actually aren’t at the end of the day. Once you do that, you’ll be able to drop the heavy load that you are carrying. All of the hiding and pretending is a lot for a person to deal with especially over a long period of time. It’s no wonder that you’re so frustrated and tired.

Sorry if I offended you or anyone else with my comment but I felt called to leave a comment. This is what I had to learn myself in life. I had to start accepting myself and stop carrying all of the shame. I started to stand in my own power and man it has been so freeing for me. I started to feel a lot lighter. I was able to get rid of a lot of anxiety and fear after I started to be true to myself and others. Please don’t live a lie. It isn’t healthy. Anyway, I wish you well.

My sister is deaf in one ear. Didn't consider herself deaf, got no help. At age 47 she got one hearing aid. There's a new thing called cross where she could have worn two aids, including one in her bad ear and all the sound would go to her one good ear. She didn't do this but it would have helped as I'm tired of only being able to sit on one side of her. Wish she had gotten two. Maybe look into this, you sound frustrated and there is a solution.

”we were best friends”

No, you weren’t. He might have been pretending to be a friend I some ways, but he definitely wasn’t a friend at all. Genuine friends don’t behave like that. Don’t let people take advantage of you that way. There are plenty of people who are genuinely kind and caring, and you shouldn’t let yourself be satisfied with anything less than that as a friend.

it's gonna be okay im 21 too

I literally just posted a vent of somewhat of a similar experience, not knowing you just posted this. It makes me feel more content knowing I'm not the only one.

Hey man, I'm completely deaf in my right ear aswell, though mine is due to being a premature baby, they think. I'm also in the moderate/severe catogory of hearing loss on my left, so wear a hearing aid for that side

People are always so surprised to learn Im completely deaf on my right... I can't have people on that side of me or ill really struggle to understand them properly. School was hell for the bullying. I get where you're coming from and I'm sorry people have been mean to you. If you need someone to vent to my inbox is open

I am not deaf, Im a CODA.

But I am a nurse and I can tell you are deeply frustrated but also having issues accepting yourself.

You have a sensorial impairment. You need to find a way to accept it. A lot of peoppe have chronic illnesses, mental health issues, sensorial or mobility impairments, and they need adaptations.

It is perfectly normal.

Once you accept it, you need to start coming out of the closet. Tell people you cant hear from one ear. If they are curious, tell them it happened during childhood, and no need to get into more details.

If people do not know, they will not understand things like why you do not answer when they call you, and they will have their own ideas as to why. It is better for you and for them if they have the right information so they do not need to make conjectures.

I think you should find some form of therapy to help you accept yourself the way you are, because there is nothing wrong with it. What is wrong is feeling shame and trying to keep it a secret, because it hurts you and makes everyone around you confused.",2025-10-17 20:52:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o9cvp4/i_am_a_21m_want_to_vent_sorry_i_might_go_deep/
1o8scx9,deaf,In what circumstances is not providing an ASL interpreter illegal?,"(Disclaimer: I’m not Deaf, but I have a hearing disability so it’s still covered by ADA.)

I am going to a famous location known for their haunted tours. I received this email in response to requesting an ASL interpreter. Does this go against ADA? I do not see how attending a tour and viewing the exhibits/reading plaques is comparable. Also, enunciating is not a reasonable accommodation for me. Is there anything I can do?

I was really excited for this tour, so now I’m very disheartened.

[댓글]
I’m guessing this is the queen mary. My mom had the same problem with them. Had to inform them it was illegal, reschedule the tour, etc. I’m disappointed but not surprised that they haven’t improved.

Not providing an ASL interpreter is illegal when it results in violation of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and/or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Title I of the ADA applies to employment. Title II of the ADA applies to public entities like government agencies, universities, courts, hospitals, etc. Title III of the ADA applies to private businesses and non-profits. Title III is relevant to your situation.

Any business open to the public is classified as a “public accommodation” under Title III. Under Title III, businesses are required to provide effective communication, this includes a qualified ASL interpreter when requested. 

A tour experience relies heavily on spoken communication. In order for the business to fulfill their duty of offering an equivalent experience to you, they are required to provide you a qualified ASL interpreter as you requested. 

Unfortunately, you will need to remind them of their legal obligation and encourage them to speak to their legal department or attorney. Feel free to use any of the language above. The National Deaf Center (NDC) offers letter templates for these types of situations for free to download on their website. You can also reach out to your state’s Disability Rights group for their support. 

If they continue to refuse, you will need to report them to the US Department of Justice - Civil Rights Division.

I am not a lawyer, but if this tour on a ship is the Queen Mary and its ""Paranormal Attractions,"" then you're in California. It's not only an ADA violation, but also potentially a Unruh Civil Rights Act violation. 

Right now, DOJ is becoming quickly politicized, but states like California have strong civil rights laws and protections. I'd contact not only DOJ, but a disability law or disability rights organization in your city/state. 

So here in California, assuming that my guess is correct and this is the Queen Mary you're talking about, I'd contact a deaf social services agency such as GLAD and an organization like Disability Rights California or DREDF, in addition to DOJ. That may put the pressure on to reverse their decision/attitude about this.

“You can’t hear and you use a different language, so how about we just EEENUNNCEEEATTE in English, how’s that?” Ye gods. That person should not be in charge of this stuff.

edit: Sorry, missed your disclaimer the first time around, and didn’t mean to possibly mischaracterize you by saying “can’t hear.” That’s what happens to your eyes when watching baseball and hockey at the same time. 😆

Probably not legal. You can file a complaint with the DOJ online. It only takes a few minutes. They will send an official letter to remind them of the law. They usually don’t take action unless there are enough complaints or they have a special interest in pursuing it further. https://www.ada.gov/file-a-complaint/

fully deaf here, and man, I hate it when this happens. and they think enunciating solves anything... when they usually over-exaggerate the mouth movements instead of talking normally,, making it hard to lip-read. not to mention, lipreading is only effective if you know the person and know what they're most likely to say, etc. with a stranger the odds plummet down to 30% for me when it comes to getting it right.

This isn't even happening to me right now, and I'm sooooo annoyed! ugh!

i got pretty much the same response from both haunted tour companies in seattle. i was pissed

What’s the desired outcome?

At this stage, the business at least acknowledged you asked for a terp. The next step would to send them the NAD advocacy letter for businesses and concerts.

I would respond and ask why they are not able to provide interpreters (they might be uneducated on how to get an interpreter), emphasize the ADA and that lipreading/enunciation is not a reasonable accommodation.

They are required to provide **reasonable accommodation**, which in this case seems to be an ASL Interpreter. I've had tours with a script, but sometimes that isn't sufficient, so it'll be up to you to decide.

It is a violation of ADA. I use speech to text on my phone... that's me... that does not meet their obligation for reasonable accommodation.

If in the US, it is illegal.

Hi there,

I’m a glass blower artist and I just sold a 3 hour lesson for 2 people through a website that sell fun activities in my city. 

The buyer immediately emailed me after purchasing telling me I needed to provide an asl interpreter for the lesson. The lesson sold today &amp; now I have 8 days to find someone &amp; of course cover the cost which I’d be fine with.

The main issue is that my studio setup where students melt glass is at a booth where their back is turned away from anyone communicating with them. And due to the 4000 degree torch flame I’m extremely concerned that without the ability to quickly communicate with each student that there can be a serious injury requiring hospitalization putting me at risk of a lawsuit.

Seems like this will be 2 students with hearing disabilities so I may be required to get/pay for 2 individual interpreters as well. (Not sure yet)

I make $194 for a lesson &amp; financially cover the glass, fuel etc… but after googling it looks like it will cost me in the range of $200-$375 per interpreter for the 3 hour lesson. And I may need 2 of them it could potentially cost up to $750.

I definitely try to accommodate students with disabilities but this is a new one for me. 8 days notice seems difficult &amp; I’ve had to completely stop production on a big order I’m working on to figure this out.

I also have a 18+ age requirement &amp; they aren’t answering my question about the students ages. 

Any tips/help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

This is illegal... But also a great sign that you shouldn't go there.  If you're fighting for access during admissions, you'll not have access during class.

Williamsburg, VA?

You aren’t Deaf? Is ASL your primary language?

I think it’s only for essential services

According to the disclaimer you are not deaf just hoh right? You don't have to answer but are you on s.s. disability? Does the state where you reside consider you to be legally hoh/deaf? If not, then unfortunately the ADA does not apply in your case. There are not a lot of other options for this situation. It's one of those gray areas or catch-22. From what op are saying it seems that the company has not given reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities a high priority. It's up to you if you want to write to the company to address the issue or contact other organizations to help resolve the matter (like some of op has mentioned). Sorry you had to experience this problem.

I agree that their suggestions aren’t adequate. I do want to be educated, I thought the ADA states that written communication is equal access to information? What if they gave you a written script of the tour you booked?

I became deaf 6 years ago and took ASL classes. I ended up not even having to use it since no doctors know it. Plus family members didn’t care to learn it… now I just use an app called Ava on my iPhone to read what people say.",2025-10-17 04:54:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o8scx9/in_what_circumstances_is_not_providing_an_asl/

TLDR: The common ""interview a Deaf person"" assignment is unethical because it tends to place upon Deaf people the burden of providing uncompensated time and labor for a student's grade. Instructors should instead pay Deaf guest speakers, assign content made by Deaf creators, or have students respectfully attend public Deaf community events.
---------------

Rethinking the ""Interview a Deaf Person"" Assignment:
By William G. Vicars, EdD, of Lifeprint(dot)com 
(with minor collaborative support from Gemini AI)
10/14/2025

For decades, a common assignment in American Sign Language (ASL) and Deaf Studies classes has been for students to find and interview a Deaf person. The intention is noble: to connect students with the living culture they are studying, bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world experience, and foster authentic interaction. However, while well-intentioned, this assignment model is fundamentally flawed, often placing an unfair and uncompensated burden on the Deaf community. It's time we reconsider this practice in favor of more ethical and effective teaching methods.

The Unbalanced Transaction: Taking Time and Labor:

Being interviewed is a form of work. It requires time, mental energy, opportunity cost, and often emotional labor. The person being interviewed must schedule a time, be ""on"" for the conversation, thoughtfully answer questions, and navigate the interaction. This is labor that requires sacrificing the opportunity to engage in other activities -- including potentially income producing activities and at a minimum time that could be invested with family or in personal projects.

At its core, an interview is a transaction. The fundamental problem with the student-led interview is that this transaction is almost always one-sided.

The student is taking.

What is the student giving in return? This is a critical question.

In professional contexts, the value given back is clear:

* A journalist gives the interviewee a platform and access to an audience, which can help promote the person's own agenda, business, or cause.

* A peer-reviewed journal gives an academic interviewee prestige, a publication credit, and a valuable line on their CV that helps with tenure and promotion.

* A market researcher tends to give interviewees money or free products for their time and opinions.

* A celebrity interviewer tends to provide an increase in perceived status, exposure to a large audience, and increased viewership or opportunities for their interviewees.

A student, however, typically offers none of these. Students usually have no significant audience, no professional prestige to confer, and no budget for compensation. The student gets a completed assignment and a grade; the Deaf person gets...nothing of tangible value. The student is simply taking (sometimes an hour or more of uncompensated labor) from a member of a community they claim to respect.

The Emotional Burden and Inherent Power Dynamics:

Beyond the issue of uncompensated time, the assignment places a significant emotional and educational burden on the Deaf individual. They are often asked the same introductory questions repeatedly by random students semester after semester: ""What was it like growing up Deaf?"" ""What's the hardest thing about being Deaf?""

This turns individuals into representatives of a monolithic ""Deaf experience,"" forcing them to perform the role of educator and cultural specimen. This is emotionally draining. Furthermore, it reinforces a problematic power dynamic where the Hearing student is positioned as the researcher and the Deaf person as the subject, a dynamic with a long and painful history of Hearing people studying and speaking for Deaf people.

Pinpointing the true source of the problem: Paid Teachers Using the Deaf Community as Unpaid Co-Teachers:

While students are the ones conducting the interviews, the ultimate ethical responsibility for this practice lies squarely with the instructors who create the assignment. An instructor is a paid professional, compensated to design and deliver a complete educational experience. When they require students to find a Deaf person for an interview, they are, in effect, outsourcing a core part of their teaching duties.

They are using members of the Deaf community as unpaid co-teachers and uncredited guest lecturers.

This practice leverages (and by leverages we really mean ""takes advantage of"") the goodwill of the Deaf community to fill a gap in the curriculum, providing the invaluable cultural immersion that the instructor is being paid to facilitate. It is a form of professional exploitation, where one paid educator uses their position to extract uncompensated labor from community members to benefit their own students and fulfill their own pedagogical goals.

The problem isn't just a flawed assignment; it's a systemic failure to value and compensate the very community that the course claims to celebrate.

Better Alternatives for Authentic Connection:
Pivoting away from this assignment doesn't mean abandoning the goal of connecting students with the Deaf community. It means doing so ethically. Here are several superior alternatives:

* Engage with Deaf-Created Content:
Assign students to watch films, vlogs, and documentaries created by Deaf artists. Have them read books, blogs, and articles written by Deaf authors. This approach allows students to learn from Deaf voices while directly supporting Deaf creators.

* Invite Paid Guest Speakers:
Bring Deaf professionals, storytellers, or advocates into the classroom (in-person or virtually) and pay them a professional speaker's fee. This models a respectful, reciprocal relationship and correctly frames the Deaf person as an expert whose time and knowledge have value.

* Attend Public Deaf Community Events:
Encourage students to attend Deaf coffee chats, festivals, or signed performances. Public, Deaf Community oriented events are okay. Burdening Deaf attendees of semi-public Deaf events by asking Deaf attendees to shift their focus from the purpose of the event to instead perform the labor of being interviewed, recorded, photographed, or place their signature on forms is not okay. The key difference is that students should attend as respectful observers or invited-participants in a public space, not as unequal-transaction seeking individuals demanding one-on-one time. The assignment needs to shift away from extraction and instead focus on immersion or possibly even contribution.

* Support Deaf-Owned Businesses: The instructor and students can support local or online Deaf-owned businesses or organizations and in doing so (if appropriate), provide opportunities to interact with Deaf business owners in a natural consumer context.

Keep in mind that it is inappropriate to require students to pay to attend an event or support a Deaf business unless such expense was clearly spelled out prior to the students registering for the class and such expenses have been cleared with administrators who are aware of and sensitive to the housing and food insecurity faced by many students.  Even so, it is better to provide a variety of zero-cost options for assignment completion that do not require out-of-class travel (many students do not have convenient transportation) or limited time windows of participation (many students have inflexible work schedules).

By shifting our pedagogy away from the extractive ""interview"" model, we can teach our students the much more important lesson of how to engage with the Deaf community not as a resource to be mined for a grade, but as a diverse and vibrant community of individuals to respect, interact with, and learn from in an ethical way.",2025-10-16 07:13:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o7zk4y/different_perspective/

Growing up I had always resented being deaf due to negative experiences, stereotypes, and discrimination. High expectations from hearing parents and peers built a lot of pressure to be independent without accommodations, and to speak orally so I am not fluent in ASL.

I went to a community college, feeling pressured by parents to have a career. I tried a lot of things only to be extremely difficult and challenging in terms of hearing, and lack of accommodations. I tried legal studies, sociology, psychology, tried science majors but all were a struggle. 

Unable to find a career, and stuck to a dead end I dropped out of college. I tried looking for jobs, but it is limited I cannot do customer service jobs or jobs that require lots of listening/phone calls since I tend to miss out on what the person is saying or individuals who have accents is extremely difficult for me to understand. There has been times I’ve spoken to the employer/manager of my deafness during the interview they’ll give me a weird look or make a comment about my speech so they see me as “unfit” for the job. 

I am really struggling on what to do, I feel depressed, disappointed, and hopeless. I also cannot afford a 4 year school since my family made it strictly an associates degree or a community college. I wanted to do photography since it’s what I am passionate in and it’s what makes me happy but they don’t support it and say it’s a “hobby” and not a job. 

I am lost, what can I do? ",2025-10-16 05:35:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o7y14m/losing_hope/
1o7sumz,deaf,HoH (SSD) using Deaf as an identifier?,"TLDR: If someone who is conversational in ASL and is immersed in Deaf culture loses hearing in one side later, is it appropriate to call themselves Deaf? 



Hey there friends, I'm sure I am way overthinking this but that is who I am as a person. Also I did search the sub and while I saw similar questions, I didn't see anything that addressed this, so forgive me if it's been posted before. 

When I was young (age 7ish), I had chronic ear infections which resulted in tubes being put in my ears. When the tubes naturally came out, it was discovered that the hole in left eardrum did not close, resulting in minor hearing loss. Later, I took ASL as a language credit in high school and was lucky to have teachers who were invested in Deaf culture and immersed us in the local Deaf community. We learned the culture and language, not just the vocabulary. When I was 18, I had a shotgun go off right by my left ear. Now I'm profoundly deaf in my left ear. 

I moved around a lot for work and didn't have time to keep plugged in to any local community for a number of years, though I kept up on my signing with friends and such. Now that I'm more settled, I'd like to reintegrate into the Deaf community but I'm wondering how to introduce myself. I think the term HoH doesn't accurately reflect my experience and some things I've read suggest maybe the term Deaf is more expansive than it used to be? I know the community isn't a monolith but I love and respect this culture and community too much to make assumptions.

1o7fx2p,deaf,Hearing asking experience with cochlears.,"I was on TikTok and I was talking to two people with cochlear implants and they were saying that after the surgery they got a lot of complications from the surgery but not from the actual implant and how it works. 

One of them said after the surgery she started feeling very nauseous and tired and the other guy didn't seem to have as many side effects after the surgery. 

They also said that they have issues when they take the implants in and out they said it's like a constant noise or something they hear that always bothers them whether the implants are in or not. 

I'm hearing and have no experience having one but I was wondering after you have the surgery and you get the cochlear put on do you have any weird effects when you take them off or put them on like any ringing in the ear or any dizziness. 

I'm not trying to say cochlear implants are a bad thing I'm just curious if this is a common thing or a one-off. ",2025-10-15 16:33:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o7fx2p/hearing_asking_experience_with_cochlears/

For Apple: Live Transcribe (elephant icon) , Live Transcribe + (green icon), AVA, Nalscribe, Otter App  
For Android: Google Live Transcribe App, Otter.

  
You are welcome :)

I wonder how there are on Android?


Also, if your work uses Teams, you can ask your workplace to enable the setting to automatically turn on captions and also transcripts at the end of calls. It has to be enabled by IT on the admin side for auto.

1o6yt6g,deaf,Looking for input,"HI there, my name's Carrie, I run a very small business called Blue and Gold Language. I love languages, and taught French and Spanish at the middle/high school level for several years. 

My business mostly focuses on pinback buttons and enamel pins that say ""I speak..."" in the language someone speaks--""yo hablo español"" designs are my most popular. I love how languages help us connect, and I love these little pins as a way to communicate you're there to speak someone's language if they choose, without needing to make assumptions about that person, their language skills, and their preferences. It just offers the information in case it's helpful.

I have an enamel pin and a pinback button that read ""I know ASL."" I have wondered if there might be demand for an enamel pin that reads ""Deaf"" (that's actually aesthetically pleasing). 

I am posting because I'm hoping to get some input from individuals who are actually a part of this community. I'm not Deaf myself, I don't know ASL--and I'm not going to lie, what little knowledge or awareness I have of the community comes from watching Nyle on America's Next Top Model. 

I'm wondering if anyone might be willing to offer some thoughts? I'm sure different individuals would feel differently about this kind of thing. Is a pin reading ""Deaf"" something that you or someone you know might be interested in? Would you find it appropriate? I've also wondered about something like ""Deaf and proud"" or similar, and wondered about one that says ""Hard of Hearing""--any thoughts? Or other ideas? As far as design, I have just pictured something in pretty script and nice colors, but many of my pins include some references to the relevant culture--my Portuguese pin, for example, has a design based on Portuguese tiles and is in the colors of the Brazilian flag. Any thoughts on the design?

I would love input from anyone willing to offer any.

[댓글]
I would recommend sourcing pins or designs from deaf artists like That Deaf Cartoonist and 58 Creativity.

Honestly, I prefer to buy anything deaf- or ASL-related from deaf-owned businesses.

Generally deaf people want to buy from deaf businesses or artists in my experience and there are plenty of these available from deaf businesses so I reckon stick with spoken languages. I live in Australia so an example I can give is this would be seen like a white person trying to sell stuff like ""I speak Warlpiri"" rather than an Aboriginal business.

It can be done, but I’d either license from a deaf/HoH artist or donate a large portion of that pin’s profit to a deaf-led organization (like one preventing language deprivation, sponsoring sign classes, etc).

1o6vnsl,deaf,Correcting communication with Deaf customer,"At work (speciality retail store) we have a signing Deaf customer I met a few months ago. I know that if you don't really know sign just stick to pen and paper, but I figured I would try to make it a little faster signing a reminder of the price for buying a bag at least. I would use more shopping-related signs, but that would be especially unhelpful for him if I can't understand his replies in ASL without fluency. He was appreciative, but he realized I don't know a lot of sign and said while wanting to learn is great, suggested we could get an interpreter for ease of communication. I was told it isn’t a viable option for the store. I ended up being more of a hindrance than helpful, so from here would it be more efficient/respectful to keep to pen and paper?
I plan to ask him next time to see what he prefers as well, but I’m appreciative of opinions and feedback and it won’t be a mistake I make again. 

I thought about making a card of short information/questions for Deaf customers to read and point out when needed so if they have further questions I can write replies? 

[댓글]
Pen and paper. You keep erring on the side of trying to provide information without being able to receive their answers. A sign with info would do the same thing. Just write back and forth.

You need to ask. You can’t assume what will work best, while the Deaf person will have the experience to know what works in that particular situation. Your job is just to try to offer the flexibility.

In the end, clear communication is what we all want. Please stick to pen and paper or texting. Not sure why you insisted on ASL when you can’t communicate with it

1o6t47t,deaf,ASL student,"Hello! 

Im a ASL student. I’m currently in my 3rd level out of 5 ASL classes in my schools interpreting program. 

I keep finding myself so much farther behind everyone else, my teacher is deaf and my classes are strictly voice off which rightfully so but there are times where I feel like I can’t retain everything. I’ve been forgetting signs a lot more often and getting confused more and more and the more frustrating my class gets the more I feel like I shouldn’t be there. 

Maybe it’s some crazy imposter syndrome but I don’t know anyone personally that is deaf and I feel like that’s a bad thing, like I have no reason to become an interpreter, All of my classmates are learning for someone in their family.
Most of my classmates have been learning ASL since high school I just don’t know if me having zero connection other than loving the language is a bad thing. I still love my classes I just feel kind of stuck and out of place.

Side note: since I’ve been forgetting signs how the heck do you find out what that sign is like I know the sign but I just forget what it means and I feel bad and kind of embarrassed to stop the whole class to ask since everyone is so much more advanced than me. 

I love learning about deaf culture I’m a naturally curious person so anything helps. 

[댓글]
Try r/ASL.

HOH here: we are rare as fuck, i am 99.999999% of people’s first deaf person that theyve met. I don’t exactly know what advice to give considering not being able to retain the information. However, i know plenty of hearing people who got into asl because they adore the language, personally I much prefer that over “i learned for someone else” especially if youre wanting to become an interpreter.

As for forgetting it: i forget it too dw, i just ask “whats the sign for ___ again?” I often try to connect the sign to it’s meaning, like afternoon for the sunsetting if that makes sense.

As far as struggling with remembering signs I highly recommend deaf events. But not just the run of the mill ones that you have to for class. I mean like can you volunteer at a summer camp for deaf kids? Then there will also be young adults your age you can sign with and also maybe make friends. I find once you take the pressure of “I have to learn” and change it to “I need this sign so I can share some fun gossip” it gets easier and classes get easier. 

As for not knowing a deaf person and wanting to become an interpreter. I appreciate those people way more. The whole “I’m learning for my deaf neighbor” is a nice sentiment but gives savor complex (at least for me). Taking a class or two to learn the language is nice. But picking a whole career based on your “ neighbors deaf” just sits wrong with me.

For forgetting signs and trying to find the meaning, see if you can get the Gallaudet ASL dictionary. It’s organized by handshape, not alphabetically by English word. I found it to be a vast improvement over other dictionaries when I was in my ASL learning journey. 
https://www.powells.com/book/american-sign-language-handshape-dictionary-9781563680434

I am also a NERD (Not Even Related to Deaf) but started learning ASL because I just kept meeting deaf people. Don’t feel bad or less than, and recognize that your classmates have been exposed to ASL for longer than you have. It takes time, practice, and exposure to gain fluency and you’re closer to the starting point than your peers, but the journey is the same. Keep working hard, keep putting yourself in new situations that are a bit outside your comfort level, and soon enough you’ll be amazed at how far you’ve come.

I don't know ASL but another signed language (Auslan) that has way less resources available than ASL so I'm sure you can find the same stuff in ASL. When I started I didn't know any Deaf people too. How much practice are you doing outside class? 

In my case I got a dictionary that has signs ordered by handshape then location then single/double/two handed signs so if I see a sign I don't know I can look it up. To remember stuff you need to practice every day (this is the same for all languages) - both receptive and expressive. I study in my course (it's a 4 year tertiary course) and I do tutoring four days a week (my TAFE provides this for free luckily but you can get a private tutor as well), watch the news, have a subscription to a service that has content from native signers broken down into stories, short sentences, fingerspelling, numbers, and vocab so each day I practice a different thing plus I go to a number of deaf clubs and many events as well as volunteering for events too. Also follow heaps of Deaf content creators online too. My biggest issue early on was finding stuff beyond beginner level as the majority of resources only cover basics but luckily a lot more intermediate and advanced stuff is becoming available. 

You can look into general language learning tips as well, I've found this useful.",2025-10-14 21:57:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o6t47t/asl_student/
1o6p4il,deaf,Why are we so divided as a community?,"This may be extremely controversial depending on your culture, opinion, and upbringings. I want to be able to speak freely and be blunt about something I've been wanting to point out for a long time and I welcome criticism and feedback but please don't be insulting or rude. 

As a deaf/hard-of-hearing individual that grew up in hearing culture and rarely in deaf culture, the divide between ""little"" deaf and ""big"" deaf is so unnecessary. We, as a whole, need to welcome everyone with open arms. It doesn't matter how deaf you are, you are a part of the community and should be accepted. If you have been oral for the longest time and just started to learn ASL or scared to begin learning ASL, we can help! You should not be given the stink eye because you didn't get a chance/fortune to communicate fluently.

I want to talk about ""elitism"" in deaf culture. In my perspective, it's to describe people in the deaf community (usually ones that have tight connections to other privileged members of the deaf community) that are arrogant, privileged, and judgy. They take things too far. When I was in a deaf school, I had only been there for a short time and I had seen enough. A good portion would be well-liked (even if they're not a good person, it didn't matter to the others), get engaged with drugs and drinking, sex, smoking, etc. and a lot of the staff members would encourage elitists who are dominating in sports, class presidencies, homecoming royalty, etc. Everybody else who weren't worth it in the eyes of those people had to sit and watch and just feel miserable because they only care about themselves and their tight circle. That's it.

You may say that all teenagers like to explore it but it's a little bit different. They would get away with things because 1 or more family members work at the deaf school in some capacity which could range from part of the board of trustees to a part-time janitor.

I also want to talk about the appropriate levels of pride in your deafness. It's totally okay to say ""I'm deaf and proud!"" and any sort. It's not okay to be arrogant or have more of a hubristic aspect to your pride and be extremely rude to people that haven't had it as easy as you. It's not okay to have the mentality of ""I'm not going to bother talking to them because they didn't grow up in deaf culture.""

I've seen pompous assholes get away with their egos because their mom is deaf and teaches history at the high school department, their siblings all graduated from the same school, an uncle graduated from the same school and is the gym teacher, and so on.

We need to be accepting of all walks of the deaf community. I know that I'm just rambling but being treated terribly at a deaf school has destroyed my self-confidence and I don't want people getting away with toxic things like this. I want us to change and become more open and closer, instead of pushing people away for silly shit. You may ask me why I care so much. The answer is I've held all these feelings in for multiple years and I just can't take it anymore and it's still happening. It's so frustrating. Why can't we all just be proud of who we are, proud of each other, and that's it. I don't want what is happening to me, happen to other people. It's not fair to us. We didn't do anything wrong.

I may be COMPLETELY incorrect or making 0 sense but this is from my experience and I hope others can relate or understand this side of the community.

Oralism is what divided us.

There isn’t a single hearing school, or community of any culture for that matter, where everyone is friends with everyone and everyone treats people fairly and nicely. 

Every community has cliques, gossip, bullies, people who think they are better than others, popular kids, people who are esteemed more than others, people deemed “losers” or “outcasts”, etc. 

This doesn’t change magically as you get older, it’s just human nature to disagree and form tribes. Even though we should all support each other that is not realistic when we all come from different experiences, background and norms.  

We just need to temper our expectations and remember that we are all infallible humans.

Fr, im a teen and HATE when being told by grown ass adults “youre too hearing” im HARD OF HEARING. Can’t imagine the hierarchy at deaf schools tbh

The world is at an extreme divide at the moment. Being deaf doesn't help. The deaf spectrum is so broad that missed sensories are also influenced by variable factors. Think. Parent interference and availability, whether the parent has deaf experience or not. Whether the child is a CODA or a COHA. CODA will exacerbate these things. Definitely an interesting subject to marinate on. EDIT: I'm profoundly deaf (with an entire hearing family), had services provided, met many deaf people, networking events, personal experiences across the spectrum, and had fallouts. I am a business developer and graduated top of my school. I don't use sign and haven't had to since college for my interpreters and hearing people questioning how it works. I actively participate in hearing and social development as a hobby (maybe 1% of my time). Experience is EVERYTHING.

I've received this attitude myself &amp; made a couple comments elsewhere a few months ago relating to this very thing.  Suffice it to say that I've been deeply wounded by this behavior (&amp; the fact that adults &amp; children bullied me, a child, for it) &amp; I will never be able to fully immerse myself in the community because of it.  I think the attitude will take about 2-3 more generations before it fizzles out &amp; this becomes the exception &amp; not the norm.

I'm just gonna copy &amp; paste the linked comments here for convenience's sake.  They were in response to someone else's questions.

[Comment 1:](https://www.reddit.com/r/asl/comments/1ju15c7/comment/mm43kgm/)

&gt;I've received the same treatment your friend did, except I was a literal child on the receiving end of rejection that made no sense to me. It drove me away from what should've been my cultural home a long time ago. It's only now that I'm beginning to test the waters and (very slowly) re-enter Deaf society, and that's only because I learned there's a movement to stop giving the attitude certain people are exhibiting here. In my case, the wound is too deep for me to ever fully embrace it like I used to. It's really sad. I hope your friend finds their way back someday and finds a handful of trusted Deaf friends.

[Comment 2:](https://www.reddit.com/r/asl/comments/1ju15c7/comment/mm50u8d/)

&gt;Thank you. I appreciate that. 

&gt;I can try, but know that I may not have it all right since I’m on the very edge of all this and am relying on things I’ve seen on social media and the grapevine to inform me. I hope someone who’s more active in the Deaf community can step in and expand on things that I may have missed. 

&gt;I also mix “them” and “we” when talking about Deaf people (a very big hint as to where I place myself in hearing vs. Deaf worlds/cultures, lol) so I hope I don’t confuse you. 

&gt;In a nutshell, Deaf people are known for being exclusionary, insular, and gatekeepers of their language. They’re downright cruel to people they perceive as having some sort of privilege: hearing ability, lipreading ability, having cochlear implants vs. hearing aids vs. choosing to wear no assistive devices, if you’re Deaf of Deaf vs. if you’re not… The list goes on. And they hide behind being “blunt” to abdicate responsibility for hurting other people’s feelings. (“You’re fat!” “WTF? That was rude!” “Oh well! I’m blunt!”) They’re also very…immature in some ways. By that I mean they can be very tit for tat, cliques, mean girls/popular people vs. those who are not, pulling people down if they show signs of becoming successful… That kind of thing. (This is an overall problem. Obviously not everyone participates in this, but it’s incredibly frustrating when, say, 60-70%\*\*\* of the Deaf population behaves in this manner and you’re not one of them, y’know?)

&gt;\*\*\*NOTE: I don’t know if that percentage figure is true—this is representative of my own observations. Other people could have very few interactions with this segment—it all depends.

&gt;This was, in a way, a necessary response toward scientists, educators, and laymen in the hearing world who saw ASL as profitable and stole it from them and made a lot of money. (Baby sign language is one extremely insulting example.) Compound this with the systemic oppression they’ve experienced for roughly two centuries (oralism, a global declaration that sign language was not “real”, eugenics, the perception they were useless to society and best thrown into institutions, etc.) and it’s understandable. 

&gt;That said, it’s because of this attitude they have that’s driving people away from learning sign language. From what I understand, the Shiny Names (the most well respected people in the community) decided this was a major problem and, in combination with Gen Z, Alphas, Xs, and Millennials, are driving the push to become inclusive to everyone. They’ve since realized that the prevailing attitude from the last…oh, 50 or so years, let’s say…has done nothing but hurt them and their reputation and their language. 

&gt;However, like the hearing world, we have assholes. (Duh. Lol.) They prefer status quo and they make that loud and clear. From what I hear, the more accepting areas are in Deaf hot spots. In the rest of the country, you’re going to have an increasingly harder time finding openminded people the further away from those centers you go although, of course, there are always exceptions that take you by surprise. 

&gt;I hope this helps.

This sort of “lateral violence” is common in any oppressed community, unfortunately. Because we often can’t fight our oppressors, we turn against each other and create internal standards built on ableism and such. 

But, even though this fault lies in our oppressors, it is still our responsibility as a community to work on. Addressing access privilege (like ability to learn sign, community access, etc) is part of that, as is addressing difference and how that leads to exclusion of late deafened and oral people, people with changing levels (Meniere’s, ANSD, Susac, hypoxic syndromes, etc.) deaf from a young age but non-lingual/language deprived, CI users, people without hearing aid access, etc. 

Ultimately, I agree that an elitism exists and it’s an unfortunate product of being in a systemically oppressed community. We would be stronger against our oppressors with less infighting and exclusivity, indeed.

I read it all the way through. Yes, I agree and I feel it. I am congenitally deaf from Hungary. It happens in a *similar way* to our country. (I think it happens *everywhere*.) **It is thought provoking!**

I grew up in a hearing family. And I live with my hearing family. I was given a *'serious' task*, I had to learn lip reading and sign language at the age of three, in addition to the hearing kindergarten. The *hearing examiner* ordered that I had to transfer to a school for the deaf. &gt;!'There I spent 10 years in prison.'!&lt; \- I went there for 10 years - *to explain*. Sorry. I suffered, I was sick. They taught us very little about the sub-curricular subjects. So there was &gt;!never!&lt; sign language in school. Because they played pranks out of malice. The (hearing impaired or) deaf and hard of hearing society really-really *imitates* everything that the hearing society has. The deaf community only uses sign language outside of school.

The deaf and hard of hearing community acts in a *circular manner* from generation to generation. I have rarely met a deaf person after a *decade*. Phew! He/she behaves the same as before. In a narrative about a topic that has turned into *sophistry*. This is often the case in the *'larger'* deaf community. I am in the minority scholar deaf community. It means that if someone know something, it is fine, and someone have graduated and got degree. The smaller and larger deaf communities are beautifully enemies. The smaller community is *quiet* and acts *normally*. The larger community is *open* and *hates* the smaller community much more. How do I solve a problem? *Nowhere and impossible!* Realized and I am *ashamed* of the hearing impaired community. :c

I will tell you something. I had been to school for years (school for the deaf, (hearing) high school, college, and university). *All alone.* I am not ashamed if I do not have any friends anymore. It used to hurt me, but now it does not hurt anymore. It is gone. I let it go. I pulled myself together. I love the hearing society. I have no other choice.

Have a nice day. :)

Severe to profound hearing loss late in life due to auto-immune disease, apparently. Hearing aids for me, they help a lot (I'm basically stone deaf without them) but no interest in ASL really as no one I know signs, so what good would it do me? What I'd rather see the deaf community rally around is more public awareness of HOH and hearing loss and how it affects people. I'm not talking about people born deaf or who had to go to deaf school like OP and sign fluently. I'm talking about millions like my father who lost a lot hearing when he was blown up in WWII or even me with the sudden loss of hearing and how that has affected my life, my interactions with people, my willingness to attend events or social gatherings, and on and on. Not whining here but we know that this invisible disability--and yes, to me the LOSS of hearing is a loss of an ability, thus it's a disability--really affects people's lives. 

I respect the deaf community who don't see it as a disability. I saw The Sound of Metal and can appreciate the points of view expressed there. But I find it hard to believe that folks who had something valuable to them and then lost it don't deeply wish to have it restored.

Your experience is 100% valid. 

I've never had a positive experience at a residential school while growing up. I come from a multigenerational Deaf family, but unlike others, we weren’t treated with the same respect because of something my Deaf uncle did. I’ve carried the weight of that stigma for years, enduring emotional and mental abuse from Deaf staff who saw me as a reflection of his actions.

I left the Deaf community right after I received my high school diploma because all those years, I never felt a sense of belonging, only survival. After 25 years of becoming and growing outside the Deaf community, I decided to return to the community to reconnect with my identity as a Deaf person. 

While the community hasn't changed, it has become heavily gatekeeping. What astounds me the most is that they still abuse their power for status, yet when someone dares to speak up, they often get in trouble, not the one who abuses it. 

When it comes to the division within the community, a recurring pattern I’ve noticed is the lack of compassion, empathy, and consideration. Many of us have experienced oppression from hearing people but what’s often overlooked is how Deaf people can oppress their own too. It’s a double standard. They fail to recognize that their actions mirror the very same behaviors we’ve suffered from hearing people.

I'd suggest you read ""Deaf Dystopia"" on FB to understand ""elitism"" better. There are many interconnected ties between Kappa Gamma brothers and Phi Kappa Zeta sisters, the abuse incidents, the status, the influence on their Deaf children, how they get away with it, etc.

We are members of the human family although imperfect. Each one of us has a routine way of doing things each day, same as everyone else. We sleep, eat, get dress, go to school or work, play, worship, relax. We have our good days and bad days the same as others do. No one absolutely no one is any better than anyone else. All of us have had experiences in life, skills that we learned from others or taught some one else, talents that we nurture and cultivate or are developing now.  

How do we achieve unity? How do we become more accepting of others? How do we tolerate others who might rub us the wrong way? Good questions, right?!

It begins with ourselves first. Being honest about our feelings, our opinions, our experiences. Can we honestly forgive ourselves? Can we forgive others for their imperfections? Can we forgive when someone says or does something that might offend us? Do we really need to respond to it at all? Could it be that we might be at different levels of maturity or maybe need to learn lessons that others might already have learned. Maybe the person that rubs us the wrong way is the one we may need to spend a little more time with to gain understanding into why they may act or say things the way they do. That would be the loving thing to do and is an act of kindness.

Granted there are those who feel the need to be elite, arrogant, self centered, self important, rude or just mean and some are just dumb or lack moral sense. To these we can stir away from; because they will not help us grow or help contribute to unity.

Change is never easy and will take tremendous effort and hard work. However, if each person contributes a little bit of themselves to ease someone else's burden and give them a measure of peace and happiness; we  will find that we are happy and contented too and have created a sense of unity as well. 

Be thankful everyday, maybe write down what you are grateful about today, cultivate a positive attitude and hope for a better tomorrow or future. All the negativity will gradually disappear or be minimal....

FYI, IRRC 'little d' and 'big D' was invented by a hearing anthropologist in the 1970s.  Even then some deaf signers were worried it would be divisive and there was discussion of it in the newly born deaf studies community. 

It was useful in these days to make a point that deaf culture exists, but today most hearing people are aware of signing.  It's still a useful concept when discussing Deaf culture as a whole, but I would avoid applying it to individual people.  I prefer talking about deaf signers.  

And note that one failing of the big D little d idea is that it's difficult for non-signers to verbally pronounce the difference between the two terms (deaf / Deaf) - therefore it's hard for non-signers to properly or easily discuss the two concepts. Which damages their understanding.

I've heard it compared to as the ""muggle/wizard"" status from Harry Potter. Seems accurate.

One of the hardest lessons I learned in life. Not everyone is going to like you. 

There's always going to be someone that you don't get along with. It's just life.

 Every community has good and bad. You have to surround yourself with people who understand you and avoid the ones that don't. 

I'm new to the Deaf community, but I've seen a bit of gatekeeping. However, I have also met a lot of people who are kind and inclusive.

People can't be forced to like each other. People can't be force to be nice to someone they don't like.  

It took me a long time to get over this naivety.  

If someone doesn't like me then I keep my space. Otherwise it's often an invitation for them to make my life hard. Sometimes they do so with pleasure.

Coming from a big deaf school and having graduated from there, I can relate to this topic a lot. (I am completely deaf, grew up deaf, sign fluently whatsoever) Many people I’ve talked to say that some “elite” students simply don’t have the time or patience to interact with those they consider “too slow.” Friend groups form, teachers have favorites, and outsiders, those who grew up mainstream, whose parents didn’t make an effort to communicate, or who learned ASL late, often feel left out.

Ironically, these so-called “elites” often struggle with their own identity. Many dislike being deaf, insult the deaf community, prefer attending hearing events or schools, and choose to date hearing individuals. The influence of their families, parents or relatives who are fully deaf and highly connected to deaf institutions, can make matters worse. Some parents enable their children, and this combination of privilege and unchecked behavior can lead to bullying and egocentric attitudes that others find hard to challenge.

It’s frustrating because this elitism creates unnecessary divides in the community. Those of us who weren’t born into tightly-knit deaf networks or didn’t grow up signing fluently often feel excluded, even though we’re just as much a part of the community. I do agree that we should aim to support each other, not judge or push anyone away based on how they grew up or learned to communicate.

Ironically enough I find it is these sorts of posts that are the most divisive.

The Deaf community has been on a good trajectory for a while now, but all communities have good and bad people - there are always cliques and ingroups as well as nice events.

But with the Deaf community it seems to be the case that people will have a bad experience and complain about it for the rest of their lives - which upsets others and scares newcomers off.

I don't want to say that talking about your trauma is a bad thing, I'm glad we provide space for that and I think room should be provided. I am not asking people never to do that. My point is more that doing that exclusively can do the opposite of what you want to achieve.

Why not be the change you want to see? Why not work to learn your local SL to fluency, find a nice group and promote it? I say that as someone who is trying to do so myself.

I don’t believe everyone should be welcomed. Protecting my peace would be more beneficial to me than letting someone into my life because we both has the same disability. An asshole should be treated like they’re an asshole regardless of their disability",2025-10-14 19:27:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o6p4il/why_are_we_so_divided_as_a_community/

So I'm curious what are some of the most creative, fun, or double take worthy names you came across?

[댓글]
Mine is elf, cos I'm a massive nerd who plays DND and does LARP.

A friend of mine is called „WC“ in German Sign Language which means toilet. It was the first sign she was able to do as a child and it stuck.

For a while, and still by some, I was called LATE because I was always late to my classes in uni.

Now I try to be early so I joke that my sign name was LATE but I've become EARLY. In BSL these signs look quite similar so it's funny.

I was dubbed “Rapunzel”, which was finger-spelled R + the sign for braid! =D My hair is super long so its the first thing anyone sees about me LOL which is lucky, my professor at the time had a brother with the sign name “beaver” for his big front teeth! 😂

I know one person who has “don’t wanna” as sign. Apparently she signed it often as a kid and was given as sign name. She seems to be chill about it.

Also a “deaf can be blunt” thing.

Two school class mates had the identical name so one was given “fat” and another one “skinny”


Later on when they’re adult at some point they’re same size…

I met a Deaf woman whose name is Martha. Someone a long time ago thought her name was Bertha. So her sign name is B*tch. I can’t remember if she said she B*tch wasn’t signed like that when she got her sign name, or if it was signed a little off center, but anyways I’m 99% sure that was her sign name.

King Charles = Big Ears.  Has led to several incidents where interpreters have signed his sign name while standing next to him, realised he was looking at them, and quickly changed to something more professional. 

Jenny Sealey (Artistic director of Graeae Theatre) = Big Boobs (she picked it herself and thinks it's hilarious.)

Trump = Big Hair

I'm detecting a theme here...

Speaking of hedgehog, mine is raccoon!!

A professor I had was obsessed with the original Batman TV show growing up, and his name sign ended up becoming something that mimicked a gesture the Joker did. It's difficult to describe what it looked like but I thought it was very unique!

Had a student who was a CODA. When her mom first signed her name, I cracked up laughing. Mom appreciated that I got the joke. Kid was the oldest of 4 and her name was ""boss"". Lmao. 

Less funny, but totally adorable: had a friend in college whose name was ""flower"" because she always picked flowers to give to her loved ones, from the time she could walk. I always smiled when I signed her name.

I don't have a sign name and not sure if that will happen. I do have a nick name my dad gave me and if that ever ended up being my sign name, I would have a giggle fit. My dad calls me Smash. 

Again I don't have a sign name. But the comments are fun to read about other's sign names.

A student I support has the name fish! :) because he likes them as pets haha
Edit: I also know a guy who’s name is 🖖 cuz he likes Star Trek

Oh, what a coincidence, I was just having a similar conversation sort of recently. Except it was more focused on really weird or funny ones.

I was discussing someone who was in my class way back in the day. He was hearing but so extroverted and so intensively involved in the Deaf community, most people just really loved him... he definitely had more Deaf friends just in one city than I have had in the world over my whole life. He also had a bunch of Deaf friends, classmates, coworkers, acquaintances, etc in many different places who didn't really know each other super well or who might know eachother but not see eachother that often (even if they knew of each other), even some folks who really didn't live super far apart. Keep in mind at this time the latest in Deaf tech was those T-Mobile sidekicks, and our school would brag on the your that they were first to have videophones in every room. It was way back when I would still come home sometimes to find friends who hadn't called or texted in my living room having eaten half my food. The dropping by unannounced thing was still common enough despite tech that my friends got through six locks without breaking a single one just by having Deaf ASL and enough patience to wait to see a Deaf person inside the next door. I *might* get a text about it if I took what they felt like was hours too long. But people just weren't as constantly connected as much back then.

So he had all these groups of friend who rarely saw each other. That meant that since he wasn't particularly self assertive beyond saying hello to everyone, each was calling him a different sign name.

He had a really common English name and so if you met someone you thought knew him (and everyone seemed to) you would be like, oh, do you know B? Except if you used the sign name you knew him by, no one did. The English name was too common to help. So you had to go through describing this dude who, in some ways, really wasn't all that visually descript outside of his personality.

Eventually they'd know who you were talking about. They'd be like, oh, do you mean different B name sign. And you'd be like, no... well, I don't think so...  but it does seem like him... and they would describe the person back to you and you would be like, that's him. You call him that?

And you and everyone you knew from your association with him would meet people from other smaller communities that were slightly but not completely isolated from one another and you'd go through the whole thing again, this time listing the name sign you knew plus the alternate you learned. And they would be like oh, you mean B[completely different name sign from the first two]. And you would be like no until you started to figure out that whatever name sign you used for him might not be the same as what the next person used.

And slowly you'd rack up this long list, of alternate name signs as everyone else did, most of them a B somewhere on or near the face. So you'd meet someone who knew him and out of a sort of ""fuck it you know this person everyone does"" everyone would just list of all the name signs they knew for this one hearing dude as fast as they could, because the list was getting loooong.

The end result was his name's signs became just a B flapped furiously in all directions in front of the face, the final reaction to the list getting too long and having that flapping (to represent the ridiculous list everyone felt stuck doing) be the only name sign absolutely everyone who knew him could recognize instantly.

I wonder if that guy was called Hedgehog because he was fast..

I am without a sign name. I lost my hearing in 2017 and my only interaction with the Deaf Community is this subreddit (small town), so I'm still working on learning more about the community and our language

1o6l29s,deaf,One earbud rule,"I'm deaf on both ears and wear a CI on my left side. At my workplace, they just implemented a new rule of ""one earbud in only"" for music and such. I understand why this rule exists, particularly for safety.

I still chuckled at the irony at this for myself. I'll still be streaming music through my Bluetooth as I can still hear external noise (like a forklift beep) and am probably more aware of my surroundings than an average coworker. Nothing like how earbuds operate.

Surely they wouldn't dare try to tell me I can't stream music while my coworkers have one earbud in for theirs.

[댓글]
My workplace has a similar rule, but for those of us who are desk workers not people out and about in the production area where earbuds are completely prohibited.  

You've got two options, 1) just say nothing and not worry about it, and keep doing what you're doing.  2) make a paper trail with HR and assure them your setup is way more like open-eared headphones only better and thus you're in compliance.    

I would do 1) and keep option 2 in your back pocket so to speak if someone gets a bug up their rear and complains.

I wouldn't tell them

I tend to wear aftershokz only because i can still hear my surroundings but when im operating forklift .. cant hear a thing anyways so classical music it is and piped straight into my hearing aids ... if anyone asks i tell them the equipment is noisy and im trying to protect my ""residual hearing"" ..  :D

I do the same at work. Nobody knows and I don't tell anyone. 
I'm safe about it and work much more efficiently with my music on.

I teach, so there’s an unspoken rule about music during staff meetings.  I wear a BAHA, so I listen to music.  Most staff meetings are a complete waste of time.

Having not worn hearing devices for years, I can trick people into thinking I hear them by observing body language and facial expressions .  I do get the gist based of that though.

Just don't mention it to anyone and you'll be fine. What they don't know won't hurt them. Also, if you can't hear them, just say it's the machinery or whatever... I've been able to use bluetooth at school or at work, but I don't tell anyone because at school, they *could* accuse me of cheating, and at work it's none of their business. Sorry for the terrible grammar.

I'm single-sided deaf.  I can use an earbud in my better ear sort of.  But then I'd be completely deaf situationally. 

So lol.  Whatever.  These policies aren't really for people like us.

1o6i4by,deaf,Are There Any D / deaf Hijabis??,"I’m struggling to find a way to wear hijab ( or even a turban ) with my BTE Hearing Aids. Are there any Hijabis who could advise how they’ve managed to make it work without altering the way your HA’s sit over you ears…?

[댓글]
Asalaam alaikum! I’m not a hijabi and don’t use hearing aids, but I wanted to say hi as a fellow deaf/HoH Muslim! 

My recommendation would be a looser style, or one that naturally doesn’t go over the ears (like some Turkish styles, Eastern European, etc.). If you still want full coverage, you could also then add an additional scarf. Or experiment with firmer (like a keffiyeh) or looser/thinner fabrica to see if that helps. 

Also if you have a female audiologist, perhaps you could ask them? They may understand how the ear moves more in a way that could be helpful! They may be able to help you reposition or clip your hijab in a more functional way.

I’m not a hijabi but this may help, I’ve also worn and met many DHH hijabis so you’re definitely not alone!

What’s the main problem you’re having? 

I wear mine in the OR under scrub caps all the time, along with head scarves etc. 

The best way I’ve found it to use either a silk/satin cap, durag, or even those hearing aid headbands meant to keep them in place underneath the fabric. 

I can typically wear a custom scrub cap that doesn’t go behind my ears, but some styles and wraps don’t allow for that. 

Try and find one that goes over (it doesn’t affect sound quality much for me since but they don’t do much). Experiment with styles and alternatively there’s some jewelry and clips that helps keep them secure.

I used to wear scarves, there's a company called wrapunzel that sells these velvet headbands and hair caps that work excellent for grip, and they helped with placing the scarves around my hearing aids and CI I had at the time. I mostly wore the scarves over the ears or partly over the ears.

Salam alaikum! I'm a hijabi CODA and have only met one hijabi that uses HAs. She would wear a long knit pull-on hijab that doesn't require pins or wrapping around the head.

Asalaam Alaikum! I am Deaf with profound hearing loss on my left side. I am not Muslim or a hijabi, I'm an Antiochian Orthodox Christian but because of our Turkish cultural influence, we frequently wear hair coverings especially during religious services. I don't make use of hearing aids any longer but when I did, I sewed a small hair clip into the front of my headscarf to hold it in place so that it could be wrapped more loosely on the neck which kept it looser around my ears and did not interfere with my HA. 

Please forgive me if I am overstepping, I hope you find something that works for you!

Salam! I’m deaf and Muslim as well but I’m not a hijabi but just wanted to say hello as well! 

I wear hijab occasionally but I don’t think my advice will be as helpful. When I was younger and had hearing aids (I have cochlear implants right now), I went for thinner fabrics and made sure my hijab wasn’t too tight as it made uncomfortable as it would press my hearing aids behind my ears. If I wear a hijab right now, I would wear a hijab cap as I can tie it in the back (which gives me the choice of how tight I would want it and how comfortable it will be). Then I would have a looser style of the scarf to wrap around it after. I don’t think this will be useful advice as I don’t usually wear hijabs for too long so dunno how it might hold after a whole day of wearing. 

You might have to experiment with different styles of wearing the hijab and different type of materials. For example, do you prefer to have something tighter to help make your hearing aids stay in place or if you need that comfort and something airy to give your ears some space. 

I’m always here if you want to message a fellow deaf Muslim !

Hello. Hoh hijabi here. I use a cotton cap and tie it losely over my HAs and wrap my hijab in one fold not more.

Salam Walaikum, I’m a hearing hijabi but wanted to say if you’re based in London there is a community of deaf Muslims in Whitechapel. Al isharah is a charity that holds Islamic classes for the deaf also open to the hearing on Fridays. And I believe they have other branches around the uk inshallah.

Any advice 

[댓글]
i use a good ol' pencil tire pressure gauge.

The ones I use, the display blinks/flashes once the pressure hits the required amount.  I always try and make sure I can also see the display.

Recently, I took my car to Discount Tire and have it filled for free. The employee does the filling.

My hearing friends and family are always impressed when I can feel a tire losing air. When you’re sensitive to vibrations and they change, you notice. That’s how I know a tire is losing air. Something feels off.

I’m not sure what kind of setup you were using, but I have a pressure gauge in my car. I check the pressure before filling, fill a bit, then check. If I overfill, I put the hose askew in the hole so it lets out some air, then check again. The pressures you should be aiming for (according to the manufacturer) should be on the inside of the door frame on the driver side. To be honest I don’t even know of the beeping you’re talking about.

Just keep an eye on the pressure gauge, I never needed my ears to air up tires

You guys have air pressure things that beep? 🙃

I use a portable air compressor (any one on Amazon will do and they are cheap you can use basically countless times) and I can set the pressure up so it stops when it's full. I don't know anything about beep.

When I get air at Costco, the screen blinks, it's the most accessible automated one I've found.

Thank you everyone! Sorry if it was a dumb question I am a new driver haha

I have one that stops when it reaches the pressure it is set to. A cheap one from Walmart.

Didn't know they beep. I use the tire pressure gauge.

I bought a portable air compressor; you just set it to the psi you want. If I have to use the one at the gas station, I try to have one of my kids with me since they can hear and let me know when the machine beeps.

I had no clue the air machine beeps!!

Get your own tire fill machine, dont get the cheapest ones cause the gauge is off and so cheap it just breaks after 10 uses (maybe spend 50-100 cad?)

They all have gauges you just read so no need to listen for a beep (they connect to your car battery to work)

Kick them or use the pressure gauge if you can't tell. IDK what's beeping. I can tell by kicking tires on my own car at this point, you kind of get used to it. On someone else's car I'd still use the gauge. Recommended PSI can vary somewhat per car too check the owner manual.

I think you're using something digital. Get something like one of these:

https://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Pencil-Pressure-10-75PSI-Vehicles/dp/B07X8GLGK3

Do u have tires pressure gauge???

You wanna come to the UK! Not only do they beep, they cut off at the PSI you set!

I got a $30 mini compressor off Amazon. It plugs into the cigarette lighter in the car, and I can watch the number go up to monitor

You can purchase automatic tire inflators, you can set how high the pressure needs to go, and it auto stops when it reaches that pressure. It's pretty good for roadside issues as well.

I have an air compressor at home and it doesn't beep. It has a digital readout telling me what my tire pressure is as it fills it.

Most gas stations near me have a pressure gauge. 

I ended up buying a $30 portable tire air pump that plugs into my car’s cigarette lighter. Bought it off Amazon and used it a bunch when my tire had a leak.  I just keep it in my car, it’s smaller than a soccer ball. It has a digital screen and automatically stops airing tire once it hits the pressure number I select. So I either stand next to it and watch the screen, or I sit in my car and go outside to check it after a few minutes.  

It takes a little bit longer than our gas station air pumps. But it’s very convenient.

I buy my own car air compressor with a screen, and with auto shut-off when it reaches the right pressure (easy to set with a knob).  

Deaf tax. 

And it's much easier &amp; quicker to use than the garage ones.

If you don't have 100% loss at these frequencies you need hearing aid with proper fitting. It usually takes few audiologist visits tuning these sounds to be audible but not too annoying.

Most hearing aids also have a function to shift down high-pitched sounds.

Also, there are sound spectrum analyzer apps for phones. I use Spectroid on android. Such beeps usually show clearly on them. It will help with audiologist too when you can tell them exact important frequencies you detect with the app but can't hear them.

I have a portable tire pump that plugs into my cigarette lighter. It has a number gauge. The tire should have a inflation range stamped on the side. Just watch the pressure gauge on the pump until it reaches the correct inflation.",2025-10-14 13:17:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o6f9im/how_do_you_fill_your_tyres_if_you_cant_hear_the/

[댓글]
https://slacowan.com/2025/09/29/ranked-deaf-characters-in-fiction/

A common recommendation would be True Biz by Sara Novic. The book is basically a crash course in form of a fiction book with some nonfiction elements that educate readers who are not familiar with deaf culture, so it’s great for hearing readers. 

(I want to note that most deaf schools I know of, including my own, are state-run, not district-run — my school is its own district with its own superintendent — so the book is a bit different on that aspect. I’m more than happy to be corrected because I’ve been curious about this since I read the book.)

I’m looking to (re)start my signing journey, but since I learned in the past I’ve developed frequent blurry vision, especially in my peripherals. 

For fellow people with vision issues who sign—how do you adapt? Just stand farther away? Bounce eyes back and down? 

In addition to this, safety when walking in a city tips are welcome! Sometimes I don’t hear or see obstacles/dangers I really need to, so I usually walk with my spouse. 

[댓글]
I'm a communication support worker for d/Deafblind people, most of whom have some type of Usher syndrome, which affects their peripheral vision. We use a technique that BSL speakers refer to as visual frame. As the name suggests, the signing window is much smaller than it would normally be, so everything falls more comfortably within the affected person's field of vision. Most Deaf people you meet are likely to have encountered someone with Usher's or at least to know what it is, so if you asked them to sign using visual frame, they would probably be able to do that quite easily.

I have horrible peripheral vision and I SO get this- often when I'm walking with my partner she has to drag me out of the way to avoid getting hit by cars- I suggest doing exercises to strengthen peripherals such as putting an object kinda near ur eyes and try to look at it (altho don't strain if u rlly cant, and try again later), bc it's basically a muscle that can be trained like any other muscle!!

1o5vor7,deaf,Deaf Retirement Communities in Asia and Latin American,"Hello, I am trying to help my  brother with living communities as he ages. He is currently in senior independent living. I think he would like to transition to a Dead Assisted Living or Continuing Care community. I found a great link, primarily for the US, through this reddit page. But I was wondering if anyone come across or compiled a list for dead residential retirement communities in Southeast Asia (e.g. Thailand) or Latin America (e.g. Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica). Costs have soared in the past ten years since out Mom went into assisted living. I wonder if there overseas ways for his to enjoy his golden years. Thank you.

1o542kh,deaf,Hearing aid at work,"Hi, im HOH on my right ear and recently (literally a few days ago) got my first hearing aid. Its not a good one but it works and its what I can afford atm. 
My issue is that I dont know if it will stay on my ear at work, I work a challenging job where im often running around, making quick movements or having someone in a restraint. Tomorrow will be my first day with the hearing aid and im not sure how it'll go, im afraid itll somehow fall out of my ear and someone would step on. I thought I could just not wear it but then again why did I get it if im not gonna be wearing it in places I need it?

Is there any way to make the hearing aid like not fall off?

[댓글]
They make clips and headbands for that. I haven't used them myself but I've seen kids with the headband.

🤣🤣🤣 nope  unless u act like rock n roll head shaking

I’m an insurance adjuster climbing building and roofs never had an issue. I used to do Jiu Jitsu classes with my hearing aids on, taped them to my head and also never had an issue.

What kind of hearing aid is it? In the canal, behind the ear etc). If behind the ear, is it one of the little tubes with a bit in the ear canal or one with a custom mold?  If it isn’t custom molded, ask your hearing aid provider if you can switch to a mold (there will probably be a fee for it FYI if finances are tight). 

I wear a behind the ear model with a custom mold and had one for over 35 years.  I’ve NEVER had it come out, even on roller coasters/jumping on trampoline/playing sports/ATV riding/dealing with physically restraining people on a psychotic break, etc.  I’ve also never used a clip or headband.  

I’d wear it and see how it goes - just be extra cautious until you are comfortable that it won’t fall off.

Use a bit of a band aid to attach it better. Then get the kind with ear molds that would survive getting stepped on. My mom used the round band aids when I was little.

If you’ve got ear moulds it shouldn’t fall out they’re quite sturdy in there but if not you could get on amazon a headband that’s made for that, you could use hearing aid clips or you could even get deafmetal jewellery if your allowed for work where you can clip ur hearing aid to an earring and it works really well

I used to do cheerleading moves as a kid with both hearing aids in. Im talking cartwheels, flips, being launched in the air, etc. if it fits fine then itll stay in :)",2025-10-12 23:26:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o542kh/hearing_aid_at_work/
1o50r0m,deaf,Deaf bluntness,"I wanted to share this story because I thought it was funny. I'm a d/HoH ASL user. I went to a deaf event near Gallaudet. To clarify, there was a designated event where people were signing. However, since we were near Gallaudet, there are more college-aged deaf students there. I was with a hearing student as she went to get water. I may have signed a few words to her but I didn't remember signing. I walked further up and this girl (around my age, likely Gallaudet student) signed towards me about 10-15 feet away, ""Where are you from?""

I didn't know this girl and it caught me off guard. I looked behind me left and right to make sure she wasn't talking to someone else and I was just in the way. I signed, ""Were you talking to me?"" She goes, ""Yeah, I was talking to you."" She repeats the question. I tell her where I'm from etc etc etc

It's such a culture shock to me because I didn't grow up in Deaf culture even though ASL is my first language. I went to deaf schools on and off so I have some exposure to the Deaf community but it was always education based, NEVER social based because I never hung out with D/deaf people my age outside of school. I already knew deaf people were likely to be blunt but I've never had a conversation started by someone completely random asking me where I'm from. No ""Hi!"" ""How are you?"" ""I saw you signing!"" ""What's your name?"" just... ""where are you from?""

It's not a bad thing, this is a Deaf bing. I was just caught off guard haha and wanted to share it here to see what other people think.

[댓글]
I think I’ve been asked where I’m from far more at Gallaudet than anywhere else. It’s typically followed by “You know [name]?” Most of the time, it’s the fastest way to make a connection. Sometimes it’s to answer why they haven’t met me before. I’m always amused by this custom.

Spanish is my first language and when I get the chance to go to Deaf events I really appreciate the straight bluntness. The hello, where are you from. 

On my home island after hello they ask where you’re from (meaning island then your Pueblo or mainland than your Pueblo), then first name and full family name. If you have a unique primary or secondary family name be prepared to analyze your family tree. So that bluntness with Deaf feels a lot like home to me.

I'm hearing, and I fucking love it. I love being able to ask what you want and say what you want, in equal measure. Of course there are still norms, politeness, and code switching. But in Deaf spaces I love just...pure communication. Low judgement.

I went to a conference at Gallaudet and was just so damn happy there. Being able to just...be. I can't even imagine the magic for my d/Deaf friends in those spaces, truly.

I can see how this would come across as blunt to someone who is new to the Deaf community, but I think it's more to do with the visual-gestural nature of sign languages. Speakers of oral-aural languages need to know people's names so that they can get each other's attention and make sure everyone knows who specifically is being addressed in a group. It's considered rude to just point at someone. But with sign languages, pointing, directionality, etc. are just integral aspects of grammar, which means that discovering a person's name is less of an immediate priority. ""Where are you from?"" is usually seen as a friendlier and more socially important question, as it's a way to figure out if you have mutual connections in this small Deaf world.

I like the bluntness.  I'm kinda direct myself, so I welcome that.

I love that!! I'm from Texas and feel at home with it!

Generally happens the same around NTID

As a multigenerational Deaf person, I don't view it as ""Deaf bing"" or ""bluntness."" It lacks social etiquette. It always turns me off when they ask where I come from, without even a proper introduction because they just want to label or judge us.",2025-10-12 21:05:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o50r0m/deaf_bluntness/
1o4smbw,deaf,HA fittings…,"Question:

Why do audiologists always seem to first initially turn HAs on at full volume, often with feedback pouring out, then work downwards if too loud, instead of starting soft then going up until comfortable??    I see a LOT of it in those videos of babies getting HAs, &amp; then they’re screaming &amp; crying while the volume &amp; screeching feedback scares them, &amp; then people are talking really loudly on top of it (as if the poor kid would suddenly be able to know their name through blaring, feedbacking HAs), &amp; it always upsets me.   One video even said the audi did it that way, “just to see if they were on”—wouldn’t it be better practice to first hold them in your hands &amp; listen for feedback, than to just turn on unprogrammed HAs into poor kids’ ears, rather than easing into it &amp; making it comfortable &amp; not traumatising??  🙁

I don’t recall ever having an audi ever do that to mine growing up; they usually started low-ish, then went up…

[댓글]
Idk. When I got fitted they did mine slowly.

Here my experience and thoughts

The reason is yes they turn up and fit in the ear and slowly dail down till they don't hear feedback.  This determines how much more extra volume client has if they were to turn up more if needed.  If they complain they can't hear loud enough or it still squel as client trying to increase can mean new mold or hearing test again to adjust the program to output feq as needed 

Thought of maxing the volume allows the brain to adapt as much loudness it can before turning down.  You want to be able to hear as loud as you can and no feedback squealing depends on your level or hearing you have left

Turning slowly up to a comfort level doesn't always allow you to max hearing you possibly have

The brain works differently from person to person.  The brain can adapt so quickly that you wanna keep turning up your volume so you are able to hear.   HA (hearing aids) are small powerful devices but it can only output enough depending on the device and once again it reflects on the amount of hearing you have left for the brain to adapt and teach itself what the sound is

Just my observation of having 20 years of HA before coming to the point of understanding that my hearing is slowly declining before opt into getting a CI


Hope this give you some insight base on my own experiences and understanding

1o3ux2l,deaf,Class reunion,"Hi everyone!

I will tell you briefly. I do not remember well that in *five or ten years* there will be a class reunion at the school of deaf, which is usual. Someone had planned it before the class reunion. The first time he invited me was on Facebook Messenger, in the class group. At first they were texting each other *normally*, and at the end they were already *fighting*. They wrote that *they missed it for some reason*. I did not understand it all. It did not happen then. A year or two later she invited me *again* on Messenger. And they wrote the *same* things. Later a deaf lady *wanted* to plan it with me. I did not accept, which is unfortunate.

Why do they do this? Who has had an example? Experience? After all, if someone does not like going to the class reunion, it is okay? Not mandatory?

I work in retail as a manger and am a deaf young woman with bilateral cochlear implants, because I didn’t begin to lose my hearing until primary and eventually became fully deaf and implanted at 17 I speak as a fully hearing person would. Most people can’t tell I’m deaf until I show them my processors.

A couple of days ago I had the pleasure of serving a signing deaf woman and her mum and friend. As I get excited meeting deaf others I let her know I was too, showing her my processors. We had a lovely conversation translated by her signing mum, and she asked why I didn’t know sign language.

This is a weird one for me, I never learnt sign language as I am luckily able to speak and hear almost as perfectly as any hearing individual. I let them know this, as well as that my family doesn’t see the point in learning sign as my processors have been so successful. I also kinda mentioned that my mums a bit funny about it, and that I think she’s upset by it (my deafness) and blames herself for it. 

As soon as I said this I was immediately embarrassed and have felt guilty ever since- is that not incredibly offensive? It got awkward and I feel terrible

I speak other languages and if it were one of those languages I would use their language directly but I feel like I need to ask this question because an interpreter is specifically for full access.
I work in ASL daily and that inspired me to become an interpreter so I am also an interpreting student about halfway through the program. I know I could ask the person how they would prefer to communicate with me but I'm curious what you would prefer if you were working in a signed language with an interpreter and came across a non-native signer. Does it depend on how high stakes the setting is?

1o3htlg,deaf,How to manage not hearing running taps,"I am severely to profoundly deaf, but I do wear a CI in one and a HA in the other. One thing that I am always worried about is leaving home, but forgetting to turn off the sink taps. In the past I have left them on, and haven’t really noticed the noise - until the sinks over flowed!

Now before I leave home, I do a physical check of putting my hand under the tap to make sure the tap is indeed off. Not ideal I know. 

Anyone have a solution? I think the iPhone has a running water notification, but I don’t want to solely rely on that.  

[댓글]
&gt; Now before I leave home, I do a physical check of putting my hand under the tap to make sure the tap is indeed off. Not ideal I know.


I'm confused, are you also unable to see the water running?


One solution is to get a  faucet with an auto shut off. There are also faucets that light up when the water is running. Also is possible install sinks with overflow prevention. Most bathroom sinks and kitchen sinks with two sides have this.

&gt; Now before I leave home, I do a physical check of putting my hand under the tap to make sure the tap is indeed off. Not ideal I know. 

That seems like the ideal solution. Google for ""pointing and calling"". It's a technique that helps prevent missing important or essential steps in a process. It may seem silly at first to put your hand under the top and to say ""the water is off"" but soon it will be a habit. Some day when you are preoccupied and walk away from the sink, or leave home, without doing that step you likely will hold up and realized you missed something important.

I grew up in an extreme drought for the first few years of my life so my habit is the moment I am not using the water just to shut it off since that’s what everyone was supposed to do back then, deaf or hearing. I don’t let it run if I am not actively using it and it goes off the second I am not using it. I don’t let it run when I was my face or brush my teeth, only when I am actively getting the washcloth wet or washing it out, or when I am rinsing my toothbrush. It stays off the rest of the time. I highly recommend developing this habit. The way they taught it to a lot of kids in school during that drought is that you have one hand on the tap and the other is whatever you’re doing with the water and when the one under the water is removed, the one on the tap turns it off all the way. It sounds a little silly but it’s a good way to get started with that habit and eventually you shouldn’t need it and will just automatically turn off the water the moment you aren’t using it. This is one deaf bing I actually don’t do because of my habits from growing up during water rationing and water shortages created a habit that doesn’t rely on my hearing at all. It’s just order of operations and doing things in the same order each time.

Ironically, the 2-3 times I know for sure I’ve accidentally left the tap running both were at Deaf schools I was a visitor at as an adult…. All the kids turned off the water as they ducked out of the activities to use the bathroom… and then then there’s me, one of a very small group of adults in that area of the campus at that time, and I got half way across campus and then was like 🤦‍♂️. My problem there is that I was anxious and distracted trying to use the taps and stuff that were way too low for me (I’m disabled but often use my crutches rather than my wheelchair around kids because they usually need my help with things that are easier on crutches and sometimes they’re nervous or unsure how much help they can ask for from me when I use a wheelchair) so I was trying not to slip and to get out of there before one of the kids walked in and saw me struggling with everything and the wrong heights for my disability and started doing something like trying to wash my hands for me or something like that. (The main version of rebellion and defiance I get when working with kids is basically “I’m going to help out whether you like it or not”. It’s definitely the version of not following directions that makes me feel like an absolute cold-hearted adult when I really have to say “no” because of boundaries or because it’s not safe for them. Other adults? Their classroom torn to shreds. Me? The kids refuse to stop alphabetizing the books and color coding the supplies and go to their next thing. There’s no way I’m not at least kind of the bad guy in 90% of the situations where I’ve been stuck gently disciplining kids. So sometimes I just run if I’m worried I’ll have to scold kids for not being able to bring themselves not to go out of their way to try to help or be nice after I said no.😅)

I’ve noticed i do better turning the tap off if there’s only 1 handle to control the water. Or if you really feel fancy, install a motion activated tap so the water shuts off automatically for you

My fear of leaving taps on are so great I check all the time even if I’m home. I can’t afford to repair any damages.

My kitchen faucet has an auto-off feature and turns off after 4 minutes.  (It's a Delta faucet that you touch to turn on/off and has a light to show water temperature, since I have a physical disability that makes handles hard and makes my hands numb so telling accurate temps is difficult. So it covers all the bases for physical disability and hearing.)

I've had bathroom sinks that have a drain hole up at the top so if the water gets too high it will drain down into that hole so it doesn't overflow. 

If you're geeky or like tech, there are sensors you can get that send a message to your phone/watch/device if it senses moisture.  That doesn't solve not turning them off, but it would at least let you know if they're getting wet and you or someone could run home to turn them off before it gets too disastrous.  You can also set a geofence notice on your phone so that when you leave the area of your home your phone sends you a note asking if you double checked the faucets, or have a door sensor or some other sensor do the same thing.  Idk what type of phone you have, but is that something an apple air tag can send you a note about? 

Otherwise I would just try to make it a habit to double check bathroom faucets before you leave the bathroom (put up a note to remind you and family members to check it?), and check the kitchen faucet before you leave the house (maybe another note by your keys or at the door to the garage or somewhere that you'll for sure notice it).

I'm big on leaving sticky notes out for myself to remind me of things. On the geeky side of things, I have certain things set up to notify me about things based on geofencing. I also have some security cameras in my house so I can check on my dog, which could be situated with a faucet in sight to double check that. 

A rock climbing friend who is a fire marshall actually just told me about a call they got from someone who had cameras in their house to check on their dog, and saw - in realtime - their dog pull something off the stove and accidentally turn on the burner at the same time. They were able to call 911 right away and only the cupboard above the stove had damage. But that would for sure be an easy way to check on the kitchen faucet. (I've actually contemplated sticking a camera in the laundry room so I can see when the laundry is done...)

Ah. 

I have stories. I actually know a teenager girl who went to work and wrecked the house because everyone else was deaf as well. Tap ran for hours.

Check them more often.

If you can re-fit your own home - maybe find a tap with a timer that automatically shuts off?

But yeah this is s truggle.

Hi there, r/deaf has no connection with r/ASL never has. Several of us find the majority of users to be insufferable. 


I don't see any reason why they wouldn't enjoy your video. You could try asking the moderators. 


Like most of Reddit there's a strong American bias even here, but r/deaf is a truly international community and as such we try to limit geographically limited posts. Your video would not be appropriate here per intent of the no sign language rule.

why are you encouraging people to keep learning? is it to center the deaf community, or to show off how much you know?

Sheeet I’m a talking deaf person, I don’t even know if it’s appropriate for me either.

I think if you have to go ask deaf people permission before you do something, you maybe shouldn’t do it. I don’t know. I think that sub is very Deaf centered and won’t appreciate your video as well intentioned as it may be. Maybe TikTok is a better platform. 

If you want people to critique you, that might be more useful on that sub. 

It’s hard to find spaces these days where deaf are centered. I’m HOH and I don’t feel deaf enough on some of these subs.  I say do what you want because it’s a crapshoot on what the reaction of whatever random amount of internet strangers see it, but understand it may not be your place to post a video like that in the eyes of other people.

Deaf community content creators already have a lot of accessible resources. There are pinned conversations in this sub about resources. 

If you want to post videos to improve by getting advice/critique on something you are trying to interpret or about something you have filmed as long as it's NOT used for profit that is I believe allowed and appropriate.

Sometimes these kinds of questions make me pause and check the group rules and pinned conversations. Usually the answers are already there.

I’d expect some people there to enjoy it and some to find it cringey. I have no idea what that ratio would be though. Either way, your enthusiasm for learning is great.

If you repost in the /asl group, I’ll answer there.

I find it weird and not really a good weird. I am not saying you can't feel proud of yourself... You've been putting in time over quite a while and so that alone in itself is a bit of an achievement before we even see your actual signing...  but I would prefer you ask more honestly and directly without pretense (and less implied ""qualifications"") that we celebrate your progress with you and keep it to that. 

Unfortunately I am on too many painkillers at the moment so I am not sure how to get entirely coherent with the why... but for me the way it seems like you're currently set up to do this post is definitely a bit cringe at best... and it could go worse depending on how you put it.

If you want us to celebrate your progress with you I suggest re-signing something you signed earlier and posting both two, clearly labeling them for dates and what you did in between to improve. (Do not just act like you learned by ✨ magic ✨ at it was all easy because Deaf know you didn't, that's frustrating for many hearing, and if you did learn super easy it is enough of an atypical experience that you would be wise to be more humble about it so other's don't feel they're incapable just because they have a more common experience learning.) You should also clearly prioritize and welcome Deaf feedback-- like center it as a major purpose in addition to celebration--- and accept it when you get it so you can continue to improve. (Ie- If you think you would feel like arguing with the native Deaf ASL teachers if they're not impressed and correct you rather than thank them for the free top of their game expert feedback, do not post a ""look how good I am doing"" post.)

Hearing people get in themselves trapped in their own weird echo chamber sometimes where they go round and round in it (not even noticing the lying, low hearing culture din of ""help Deaf, Deaf need hearing help"" going on in the background and end up taking up too much space to the point they don't even give themselves the opportunity to realize a very basic truth-- that most Deaf are naturally more lifelong experts on both Deaf *and* hearing than the vast majority of hearing people, including most signers, can usually ever hope to be. We may be a new world opening up to you, but in most cases ya'll have had us surrounded since birth. The majority of us are experts on hearing people and naturally tuned in with Deaf. I think that's something to know everytime you put yourself out there in matters realted to Deaf and Deaf culture (ASL is both).

What I would really love to see more of are hearing people who sign deeply educating themselves on issues around Deaf education, language deprivation, parenting Deaf kids, etc and then use that knowledge to compassionately and without blame change the hearing cultural norm to be that all hearing parents just automatically assume when they have a Deaf kid that they are going to make sure that Deaf kid learns sign as their first language and continues to have that access through life as they build out their billingual skills.

Less ""this is a pretty language and hearies you will love it as your next hobby/ project for rescuing Deaf from some imagined second rate state of being where only hearing have the keys out"", and more ""hey, this is a real language that's great for deaf kids, let's have  sign be the hearing cultural norm for a first language from the moment you realize your child is deaf, and their second language that you sign them up for the moment they start to show signs they don't hear as well anymore or are loosing their hearing or have a condition that means they will loose it"". Less of a hearing people echo chamber and more using your newfound access to the community to support the sorts of cultural narratives and the conversations and information sharing that supports more meaningful changes for the Deaf community than your Starbucks barista learning to fingerspell. (Like, that's nice but the impact is usually much less than her learning hearing aids don't ""fix"" deaf or sound the same/ provide the exact same access as natural hearing or him just stopping himself from saying, ""I am sorry you are Deaf"" and then having our own and paper or gesturing or holding up the cups and different kinds of milk without being asked.)

I would also like to see hearing people sharing more about their own cultures in ASL for several reasons:
1.) Deaf sometimes have poor access to their own cultures outside of Deaf culture because they're Deaf,
2.) Hearing people can learn what their culture looks like with Deaf sensibilities and access applied to it in some cases where Deaf have been included in their own cultures
3.) Deaf and hearing can bond on equal footing sharing their cultural similarities and differences.
4.) Recognition of one's own culture, pride in it, and getting to see it through someone else's eyes often helping hearing people resist the hearing dominant culture tendency to ""other"", exoticism/non-sexual fetishizing, or making often appropriative grabs at Deaf culture.
5.) It's often just fun.

Like, surely you have learned how to do something more creative and useful with your ASL other than play hearing saviour to cheer on those under-motived hearies who will somehow magically ""help"" those poor Deaf by learning ASL. I am not saying that is your attitude for certain to be clear, just the road that runs parallel to this action is often that.

[Anyway, sorry this was so long and probably very round about. My pain levels have been through the roof lately so I finally gave in and too my painkillers and now goodness knows if I make sense anywhere except in my own head.]

r/ASL really has nothing to do with r/deaf. The culture and rules of each subreddit are different so it would be better to ask there. I couldn't tell you if your video would be appropriate because I am not qualified, I haven't seen the video, and because there will always be people who agree and people who disagree. There are a lot of Facebook and discord groups for ASL learners if you want a referral, they are set up with space specifically for mostly hearing learners to share videos of themselves signing.

1o38982,deaf,Parents blaming my hearing aid,"Hi. I'm 15 years old and i am hard of hearing since i was 4. My parent keep blaming my hearing aids for being hoh. My brother is also hoh and my second brother is not.
The second brother is not but when he was little they also told my parent that has little bit of hearing loss. My parents refused to get hearing aids for him and he is hearing fine now.
 I just find a stupid argument because my older brother who is hoh didn't wear his hearing aids for the whole secondary school and his hearing is now way worse. 
I really hate that they keep blaming my hearing aids for my hearing loss. If you have any tips to change their mind or any other advise please let me know. 

Byee

I'm so sorry to tell you this but your parents are very stupid.

That’s sucks. You might want to take your parents with you to audiologist and have them talk to audiologist because sometimes someone who’s professional explain or educate them might help them understand or get a new perspective about it.

Well, what's the specific pathology in your case?  not that it matters, you can't change their minds. 


In a few years when you're done with high school, you can move far away.

Honestly. Ignore them and realize they are idiots.

Have them take you to an audiologist and ask the dr in front of your parents. Of course you already know the answer but having a dr answer the question might help them realize they're wrong without putting them on the defense.

My advice is to learn what you can control, and what you can't control. Sometimes it helps to draw a circle and put the things you can control in the middle, and the things you can't control outside it.


In this example, you can't control what your parents think, you can control how you react to them. (another phrase I really like is reasons are for reasonable people) 


You can control your reactions though. Find something that's helpful to tell yourself when they say something like this (eg  they are just trying their best then though they don't understand) and come up with scripts in advance of what you'll say when they say something about it to you (mostly switch the topic asap) a therapist can be good for this if you can access one 


If there was any way to change their mind you would have by now, when looking to see if you can change someone's mind you need to look at how they take in new information, if they are open and curious it's worth continuing, if not don't bother. You can still introduce them to new ideas, but don't keep trying to change their mind on a thing they closed off about, the best way to convince ppl is to live the things you believe in, and give them time to come around to your way if all their own baggage will let them",2025-10-10 18:03:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o38982/parents_blaming_my_hearing_aid/
1o37lvs,deaf,deaf gains,"please post any Deaf gains you can think of. i have been rapidly losing my hearing since june (after years of fluctuating loss) and could use the positivity as i continue to adjust 🤟🏻 TIA :) 

[댓글]
Gains for me.

* Positive role model for my deaf kids
* Free access to US National Parks
* Sleep through thunderstorms
* Free college tuition in my state
* Bluetooth streaming to my hearing aids

My two favorites are Bluetooth streaming and the ability to “turn off” my hearing whenever I want to which I do whenever people are arguing around me or whenever I hear any annoying noises that irks me.

Having higher quality friends and people in my life.

in addition to turning off hearing which others have said, i offer:

not being distracted/annoyed by recurring background noises (squeaky chair wheels, hvac whirring, etc.)

&gt; after years of fluctuating loss

Confidence in navigating the world despite our wonky hearing. I'm still not completely deaf and I don't know if I will one day be.  But I'm increasingly able to navigate a world without needing to hear-and-understand speech.  With that comes confidence.  

When I had more hearing I was reluctant to grab the bull by the horns.  Voice off.  Pad and paper out.  Start learning to sign.  I didn't want to do that ""until I had to"".  But knowing that I can navigate the world as a deaf person is a source of strength.  The hearing I do have becomes a bonus rather than a necessity that I am terrified of losing.  My fears of hearing loss relate mostly to music / environmental and not social isolation.  By the way I suspect my talent for rhythm comes from the hearing loss as a musically inclined person.  I do hear music differently.

It often shows a person's true colours.  The little back and forth we have to do to establish effective communication could be thought of like doing a quick interview.  Do they show respect to someone who is different?  Are they adaptable?  For me it often has to take place even before small-talk can begin.  I'm not sure I even want to bother to talk to someone who doesn't have a base line of patience, respect and adaptability.  Someone else can deal with them!

Interpreters at concerts (you have to learn sign language). You can buy the cheapest seats and the venue will have the interpreter area a lot closer to the stage. The terps are usually pretty chill and just as excited to see the show as you are! You don’t have to be perfectly fluent in ASL before you ask for interpreters. 

Downsides: you have to request terps in advance. You probably have to call the box office (IP relays are a gain and a bing). People will fishbowl you a bit.

Bluetooth streaming straight to cochlear implants/hearing aids/whatever. Double bonus is that you can bluetooth stream music as loud as you want to you and it is literally impossible for anyone else to hear it

Also sleeping through thunderstorms, dogs barking, planes/helicopters flying around, etc

also fewer distractions while working, and we're better drivers than hearing people in general because of it

Bluetooth straight to my hearing aids has been an absolute joy for me. 

Also there are annoying squeaks and beeps in the world that drive other people crazy that I just don’t hear.

Lawn guys came scheduled to do work by my landlord and decided I’d take a nap. 

When I woke up there was a fully grown, 100ft+ tree missing from my backyard.

Personally, my PTSD gets triggered a lot less the more deaf I am. Avoiding soliciters. There are a lot of sounds I don't miss. Kids screaming, alarms blaring, thunderstorms. Being able to choose whether or not I want to hear. My hearing aids double as earbuds which is cool.

On a flight with crying kids and wanting to sleep. I turn off my processor and sleep.

I'm a med student. I take care to minimise all background noise before I begin talking to a patient and I don't look away from their face, as I need to lip read. This helps them to feel heard on all levels. I lose count of the number of times I've been told, ""I wish everyone listened the way you do.""

If you know how to do it right, you can troll the hell out of hearies :)

I never realised that noise cancelling is a *thing* for hearing people.

Like for me, I can put a pair of headphones on and be oblivious. One time I took my headphones off to discover the fire alarm was going off.

Whereas hearing people have to actively work at noise cancellation. My coworkers can still hear what's happening in the office even when they've got headphones on and I find that so weird.

Can't hear the ghosts (?) anymore.

My deaf son has lost his voice but because we use Auslan he can still annoy us, I mean communicate with us ;)

i’m way deafer in one ear than the other, and i was able to cover that ear and test all the fire alarms in my house for my roommates haha, i also only ever felt the need to cover one ear during fire drills and such when i was at school. being deaf in these kinda situations has always been a plus for me

Never been startled by loud snoring roommates.

Can have private conversations across a crowded room.

No phone spam calls.

We can easily tell who is and isn’t worth our time

Our community can be found anywhere you go and is usually very welcoming

Screaming babies and whining children in public have no effect on your enjoyment of the outing (except if they are yours).

For me, it was finding new friends. Getting an opportunity to learn a new culture and language. 
Plus, the ability to turn off my hearing aids when I need a break. Hearing people can't do that 😏


I probably have more, but I'm drained from studying

I don't have to talk to any hearing people if I don't want to. I type on the app BIG and then they usually don't try to talk to me anymore. I get to decide who I invest my energy in. Some people are great and gesture with me. 

If I use my voice I sound like a person with full hearing and then ppl often don't want to work to communicate with me so I'm picky in places like store about when I use my voice. It's easier not to talk and just use other communication. I get to choose.

Had an intruder drill in my school last week and the alarm for it is like a fire alarm but far worse and far louder, my best friend looked at me and stuck her finger up at me out of jealousy when she saw me turning down the volume on my devices😭

People annoy me way less with their noises lol.

I always know if there’s a cop ahead in the highway because being reliant on my environment for clues has taught me to pick up on unusual differences, ie cars suddenly grouping together at the same limit on the highway tells me they all slowed down to exact same speed limit because they saw a car. I can feel when my car tires are losing air, I don’t have to listen to crying babies, if I’m overstimulated, I can just turn off my aids for instant mental peace. so many advantages.

No worries about the pesky CO2 detector when you're cooking in your RV wth the propane stove and all the windows closed.

My favorite part of my hearing (and lack thereof) is being able to roll over so the ear with some hearing can hide against the mattress, and my deaf ear catches all the traffic noise…so I can sleep like a baby! 🤣

This may not be applicable to you, but for me I feel like being deaf allowed me to appreciate my senses more. Do you ever listen to loud music just to feel the beat in the soundwaves? I love the way speakers FEEL when blasting tunes. This world has love letters to you everywhere, and I feel like being deaf made me more aware of it.",2025-10-10 17:39:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o37lvs/deaf_gains/
1o2rsgs,deaf,Anxious about going Deaf,"I've had hearing issues my whole life, I've had tubes twice and during my healing both times and just in general my dad boxed my ears while I was growing up. I've been genuinely Hard of Hearing since around my 2nd procedure in 1st Grade and it's progressively gotten a worse since then. 

I met my husband in high school when I was a freshman and he was a Junior. He has 3 years of ASL under his belt and got super involved in the Deaf community while we were in high school, he knew about my condition and I've proceeded to have ear infections and hearing issues throughout our relationship. We've had 3 kids, eldest in Kindergarten and youngest is almost a year old... 

I feel like my world is closing in on me. I'm 28 now, turning 29 this year and I feel like my hearing is only getting worse. I currently have an ear infection and each new ear infection I feel like brings a little worse hearing each time. It's heart breaking. I am filled with dread right now wondering what my new normal is going to be. 

I'm blessed to have a husband who knows ASL and has only grown his knowledge and enjoys teaching our children ASL, but reading lips is difficult for me, and hearing aids really upset me for some reason. My Aunt is mostly deaf, my grandfather is deaf in one ear and my dad is deaf in one ear so the odds are stacked against me on this. Watching my Aunt struggle through hearing aids and seeing how frustrated and sensitive they made her makes me anxious. 

I just feel like I'm losing my world... it already impacts me enough to where communication is difficult. I can't watch things without subtitles at all, I have to ask people to repeat themselves all the time, I go through life nodding trying to pretend like I know what someboody is saying and I'm just scared. 

I've been told my whole life to prepare for more hearing loss and I have, but I don't know where to go from here. I don't know what to do. Do I get hearing aids? When should I start preparing to actually learn ASL (we already use some small signs here and there)? Should I get another ENT? I haven't been since high school, but I'm so scared. I KNOW my hearing has gotten worse and I just have alot of anxiety over it. 

My husband has been amazing through all of this and has actually ensured we've taught our children baby sign language... he works with our children on the alphabet so if all else fails they can finger spell. Our kindergartener is starting to get it down especially with her Kindergarten class using ASL. I'm grateful to him, and he's suggested hearing aids already, but to me it feels like giving up on my hearing. Like once I have hearing aids... what then? 

Has anyone gone deaf or mostly deaf as an adult? I could really use some kind words. I've struggled my whole life with my hearing, and it just feels like my body is finally betraying me.

Hi friend, it’s all very confusing but there’s thousands of people who’ve been right where you are, there’s a huge community and world on the other side of this.

Lots of people become deaf later in life, they’re referred to as late deafened adults, many of them have the exact same struggles. Find these groups and connect with them. 

Everyone handles things differently. Some people learn to lip read, some use hearing aids/CI’s, some use ASL, and some just use writing/texting. But once you get into the flow of things and learn how to accommodate yourself, things aren’t as difficult. 

ASL is a useful tool for you, especially seeing as your husband already has knowledge and connections. It would be a great idea for you to start studying now, going to Deaf events, and connecting with people regardless.

You should get another ENT and audiologist, visit them yearly and keep your health in check. Talk to them about your options, family history and what tools and resources you have access to. If you have frequent ear infections, visit your pcp, some may need antibiotics.

Depending on where you are, there are rehab facilities and groups that can help, some are through DHS, hospitals, and Deaf schools. They help with classes, technology, work counseling, advocating for yourself, and so much more.

Also, as someone with Ménière’s disease, I’d suggest you might want to look into it. There’s plenty of reasons people become deaf but familial single sided deafness is often related to this condition. It might not be but it’s good to rule things out.

I’m astonished and a bit confused by your attitude… why haven’t you learnt ASL already? Seriously? If your husband knows it, what on earth prevents you from learning? You should have done that yesterday. Download Lingovano today, before reading the rest of the replies here, and sign up for classes. It’s just a language, and it’s open for anyone. As long as you have eyesight, otherwise I’d recommend protactile. I can’t believe people are putting off learning. Do you think it somehow will be easier or more exiting to explore the language once you maybe have no hearing or less hearing than today? Just do it.

I’m just as baffled at the attitude towards hearing aids. There is nothing odd about them. They’re just microphones connected to electronics that can amplify the frequencies you need amplified. You need to get better role models for hearing aids. Buy some jewelry from Deafmetal and look at all the millions of hearing aid users who aren’t old and whichever no issues with their hearing aids. The trick with making the hearing aids work, is to get a really good audiologist who you trust. They can guide you and fix any problems you encounter. The best way to have problems with hearing aids, that’s waiting too long before starting. The longer you haven’t hear a sound, the harder it is to adapt. Getting hearing aids early and having a good dialogue with your audiologist will save you a lot of headache.

Hello! Thank you for sharing your story. My experiences differs from yours but here’s what I know. I’ve been deaf my whole life and been wearing hearing aids since I was 2. I have kids now and they are also just like me, it’s genetic. They have taken to hearing aids and the Deaf community so well . They are proud of who they are. I see other parents that are hearing struggle to get their young children to wear hearing aids or understand their kids from their perspective. 

Since you mentioned family history, it may be a positive experience for them to see you do the booth and get hearing aids if that is something they want in the future. I strive to be the positive role model for my kids. I didn’t have Deaf adults around to guide me. 

Obviously you don’t have to get hearing aids but if you have a hearing partner and children, it could help and improve your quality of life. It’s up to you. But don’t be afraid to push back if you don’t like the hearing aids you get. Changing programming or brands can make all the difference. 

Additionally, having a recent audiogram may be helpful. If you are in the US, you would qualify to get free access to National Parks and potentially services from your state’s vocational rehab office if you are interested in working or going to school.

&gt; Has anyone gone deaf or mostly deaf as an adult?


Yep. I had ear tubes twice in my left ear when I was young, like you. Then went deaf a few years later due to unrelated causes. 


It was first noticeable in hearing tests when I was about 13, I was 100% deaf on the left side before I finished high school. 


You're not even 29 yet, when I was 29 I was severe to profoundly deaf in my good ear. I couldn't use a phone without 2-line vco (the precursor to captioned phone) it's about the time I switched from considering myself hard of hearing to deaf.


The best advice I can give you is to learn to be comfortable in your own skin. It seems like your deaf family members weren't good role models in that regard. Try to see if you can find some peer support and possibly a professional to help you through the anxiety your feeling.


From what you say it sounds like your loss is conductive, have you considered a BAHA? 


Do I understand you correctly that you don't have hearing aids? You probably should have had them your whole adult life. I'm sorry that you've been unable to pursue that. Giving up on your hearing? What does that even mean? 


I'm sorry if this comes off as blunt or insensitive, but your biggest problem is your fear and anxiety surrounding your deafness. Please seek out some behavioral healthcare, some kind of counselor or therapist.


I genuinely wish you the best. You're almost 29, and your 30s can be awesome, even if you're deaf or hard of hearing. (Honestly, my 30s were pretty good) Once you move to a new paradigm you can really take control with one foot in the hearing world and the other foot in the deaf world. There are many different ways to be deaf and you're among thousands of people like you. We just tend to be separated be geography and time. 


Good luck, please post again if you want to ask about specific solutions in being alive while deaf.

""I am filled with dread right now wondering what my new normal is going to be.""


The dread is the worst patt though 💚💚💚 what you are facing is a lot of fixable problems, but most of them are just that - fixable. Like subtitles are a great example. Why does it matter you can't watch without subtitles, subtitles exist, you got this 💚


I'm not saying being Deaf is easy and you are never going to have problems (oh you want subtitles at a Cinema? Lol good luck with that 🙃) but overall, your life isn't going to be all about struggle. My advice is stop nodding along, stop asking people to repeat themselves, and start leaning into supports that actually help you. Like now is the time to learn asl and get your extended family to do the same. Now is the time to start asking people to write things down you missed, or use live captioning on your phone. It's okay to still grieve not having the life you expected, but that grief will be easier to manage when you are actually addressing the things that aren't working for you now instead of letting them overwhelm you   


Id also recommend connecting to your local Deaf org,, like others have said they'll be plenty of other ppl in your situation, which might help you feel less alone

I lost all hearing in one ear 18 months ago and partial hearing in the other.  I was pregnant with our third at the time, so possibly a side effect of that.  It was a matter of hours.  It’s not returned.  I have had other issues in my life.  Tubes 6 times, 2 sinus surgeries.  But no hearing loss really until 18 months ago.

First, find a good ENT.  Your ENT should be working with you on these issues.  Have you had MRIs and CAT scans to see if a sinus surgery would help?  Ghey should be proactively working on the infections and also be working with you on an approach to hearing.  I’ve had many that don’t.  Find one that will and they’ll help you navigate which device is a decent option for you.  Of the hearing aids mess with your ear canals, talk to your ENT.  I’ve started just using paper and pen for transactions like fast food and pharmacies.  There is also captioning apps and I use the captioning accessible feature for phone calls.  I use captions for TV and movies.  And my kids and husband are very aware they have to be loud and in my eyeline and facing me.  I will be getting a CI soon.  

I think your concern is that you have functioned as hearing and now you’re having that threatened.  It’s an understandable reaction.  For the most part, sign isn’t much use to me.  Even if my husband and kids learned enough to have conversations I have church, book clubs, kid and mom groups, all the places I take my kids that sign wouldn’t help.  Tracking them in crowds when I can’t hear their voices.  Sleeping through a fire alarm when it went off in my bedroom…I mostly worry about function and accessibility.  So I’ve leaned into a lot of technical solutions…walkie talkies where they can hear me ask them to come to my eyeliner, bed shaker alarm, accessibility apps like captioning, and I say up front I’m functionally deaf and I need x, y, and z.

Not to get all audist I know this is a deaf forum but if you are functionally oral with some residual hearing you really should try hearing aids if you haven't yet!  

I am deaf without my hearing aids.  I can lipread if someone has a loud voice and talks as loud as possible without shouting.  But no one has the patience and many settings don't even allow people to talk that loudly without everyone staring at them.  If I put a smartphone on max volume up to my ear on a call I hear a tiny little faint sound I can't understand.

With hearing aids, I can pass as hearing in a lot of situations.  I can understand speech without lipreading sometimes.  I can use the phone sometimes but I avoid it because it's really hit and miss.  

If your hearing is better than mine and it sounds like it is -- you will probably benefit even more from hearing aids.  This is oddly counterintuitive and so many people don't understand this -- the better you hear the more you can benefit from hearing aids.  To wait until it's ""bad enough"" to justify them is so self-defeating and I don't know why people ever got that idea into their heads.  It's like waiting until you're fully blind to get glasses.

Just don't torture yourself with them.  They will be unpleasant and set you on edge at first.  Think wearing them for 10 or 20 minutes a day at the start.  Ease into them over many months.  Have an ongoing discussion with your audiologist about their programming.

The anxiety is due to lack of confidence due to not knowing how to engage the world on deaf terms.  When you learn that (and you can and will) the anxiety will lessen.  I've been there too.  You got this.

The other commenters are ultimately right about sign language.  We can adapt to get by and communicate orally.  But effortless casual conversation - I don't know about you but I personally am largely cut off from that with spoken language.  From what I understand it's necessary for psychological well-being.  And so I've been learning to sign.

Hi!! I’m sorry it feels so scary. I lost my hearing when I was too young to remember, so I can’t imagine what *losing a sense* feels like. The other commenters advice on learning ASL is a good idea, and I second them - but I also just want to assure you a bit: everything will be okay. 💖 hearing or deaf, hearing aid use or lipreading, you will be okay. I promise. 

I was raised like a hearing child though I wasn’t, and so even though I KNEW i was deaf I tried to pretend I wasn’t. I was ashamed and afraid, and kids were mean. Then I went to a deaf college and met hundreds of other adults and kids like me, watched their art, their music, and their theatre and the fear began to recede. I haven’t learned ASL fluently yet (other disabilities make hand movement painful) but I found that the world was still just as beautiful and wonderful and people were still kind, even though I cannot hear most of it. There are dickbags yeah, I won’t deny life is hard, but you will still be loved. You will still be YOU. 

You deserve to be included in conversation, you deserve to have fun in the world, and most of all you deserve to be happy. In whatever way you will feel best supported, you deserve to pursue it. &lt;3 

If it helps, maybe you can frame it in your mind as being a good example to your kids. I’m sure they can tell you’re anxious, I knew my mom was with every dentist appointment she called to make, but she still went. She modeled for me what it looked like to be brave for your own sake, and I walked into every audiologist trying to emulate her. “Do it scared” was the best lesson I learned as a youngin! 

I wish you and your family all the best. 💛 Good luck, my friend!! 🍀💫

I understand you 100% except I had normal healthy hearing until I had an incident at my old job. In the five years since it’s progressively gotten worse and I have hypersensitivity to sounds which are kinda hard to avoid. I wear earplugs but they don’t always seem to help. In the last year I’ve lost hearing about 4x slowly but steadily. So I’m glad you have some support with your family. I’m scared of losing my ability to hear talking. I’m scared of leaving home cause of the next big impulse noise. I’m scared of losing my ability to sit down after work and watch a youtube video or netflix for example.

Many people who become Deaf as adults feel grief, confusion, and isolation. Therapy with Deaf clinicians can make a big difference. Deaf Counseling Center is a Deaf-owned national therapy practice offering ASL-based and text-based teletherapy for Deaf, late-deafened, and hard-of-hearing people. Their team understands Deaf identity, communication access, and mental health from lived experience.

1o2rl2i,deaf,uni loneliness,"hi, i’m 19F and in my 3rd week of university and i’m severe to profoundly deaf with one cochlear implant!
i’ve made many hearing friends and have gotten really close to them and everyone has been really kind and supportive about me being deaf but i feel weirdly lonely because i just feel like im the only deaf person here. 
i’ve grown up completely mainstream being the only deaf person everywhere i go, sometimes i just want someone that i can really connect and relate to, if that makes sense?? 
i’ve not met a single deaf person here and there’s no deaf/disability related uni societies and i’ve tried city-wide events but there’s no one my age that attends them so it’s been really hard to find anyone.
I love my hearing friends but it gets tiring when i’m constantly explaining things and having no one that can truly understand.

Hey! I definitely feel this growing up mainstream although I'm Hoh...even then it's pretty rare where I am..the loneliness of not being able to connect with someone that ""gets it"" is a very valid feeling to have.

I'm not sure if this specific area was covered but If this helps I would recommend checking out your university's student representative association, at least where I am we have either disabled cohort/associations &amp; a National Disabled Students Association this might help outreach to other folks involved that are a part of the Deaf Community? I know you kind of mentioned this though...

Are you in touch with the Local Deaf community centres &amp; spaces (And even disabled spaces)?

Sorry if I'm not very helpful! but hopefully something was.. :''') but hey also always looking to make new friends if you're keen :)

Does your college (or one nearby that you can maybe do a one class exchange with) offer BSL (assuming you stayed local) classes? That’s a good place to meet people who sign/ are learning that are your age, meet at least one Deaf person (hopefully) who can point you in the right direction in the area, and hone your own skills (looked back and your profile and it said you didn’t sign three years ago, so a class is either going to teach you new stuff or if you’re already signing a lot more it can help you clean up your signing to make it look more clear and native).

Any non-signing deaf community is often very hard to come by (unless you want to go all low key self-hating like AGB society) once you graduate high school, so if you’re feeling that now, college is a good time to look at getting more involved in your local Deaf community, getting super comfy signing, etc if being around other deaf is something that feels like it will have an enduring importance for you through your lifetime. It’s also a very common time for mainstreamed folks to try to learn to sign and become more immersed in the community, and you’re still young enough that people will see you a little bit as a kid since you’re in a transitional stage of life, so you may get a little extra support that you might not get if you wait too far into adulthood. (It doesn’t always happen, but generally if you do get a lot of extra help finding your way in the Deaf community, it’s going to happen when you’re younger and tends taper off as you get older and people expect you to be more independent, self-guided, and self-assertive… and as their lives get busier with more and more adult life demands as well.)

I would also go to the events with older people. If they’re like Gen-X the chances they have kids your age is pretty good. Tell them you’re having problems meeting friends your own age and ask them for help. And older friends are good to have. They can help bail you out of the perils of being young so often by good advice, helping you with a skill you didn’t know how, or by being full on, well-settled adults who don’t have 50 roommates and have own their own darn couch you can sleep on. So make friends with them and ask about their older teen and young adult children. It’s less weird in the culturally Deaf community to be friends with both the parents and the teen or young adult kids…. They aren’t going to be mad at you usually if you merge more into their kid’s friend and their “adopted” extra adult child who they like to hang out with, and family friends who both generations enjoy having around are often a bit of a relief for both generations because it’s easier to plan to include you as a guest in family stuff.

Hi, we have a free Deaf dating group with more than 14,000 members worldwide. Although it is primarily a dating group, some have found awesome Deaf/Hard of Hearing friends there. We are confident some of our members are in your area.

There is a link to the group on my profile. Please feel free to check it out and join if you are interested. Cheers! 🙂

Hey, I totally get how you feel. Even when your hearing friends are super kind and supportive, it’s just not the same as being around someone who really gets it without you having to explain everything. It makes total sense that you’re feeling lonely being the only deaf person around can be exhausting sometimes, even if everyone means well.

It sounds like you’re doing everything right by putting yourself out there and trying to find people to connect with. It sucks that there aren’t many people your age in the local deaf community, but you’re definitely not alone in feeling this way. Wanting that kind of connection doesn’t mean you don’t appreciate your hearing friends it just means you want someone who understands on a deeper level, and that’s completely valid 🩵

Hey ! I’m 22 and just finished uni as a deaf chick myself,, dm if u wanna chat :)

I’ve felt that too, it’s totally okay to feel this way. Being the only deaf person around can be really isolating sometimes, even with supportive friends. You deserve to have people who truly understand what it’s like. Maybe you could try looking for online deaf student groups or forums, sometimes it’s easier to connect that way until you find others in person. But really, you’re doing great, and your feelings make complete sense 🤍

I’d gently suggest reaching out to Deaf Counseling Center (Deaf-owned, national therapy in ASL/voice/text). Their Deaf therapists specialize in helping people adjust emotionally and rebuild connection. [Www.deafcounseling.com](https://www.deafcounseling.com)

Cuz u are feeling that u don’t belong in ur world .   I am only deaf in hearing family and grew up 2 worlds. I do speak and lipread and asl since i was 3 now i am 52  maybe u should go deaf/hoh gathering  and see if u feel like where u should be ???  If it isn’t?? Maybe u need to see advise

as a 45 year old married parent ... i feel the same .. my wife and child dont really understand and its hard when you have none of your community around :(

Here's yet another idea, just winging it with this:  go to the website for Gallaudet University. I think they have strong connections to deaf Hoh networks and communities that are geographically diverse, not just at Gallaudet itself, maybe these were originated at Gallaudet.  So you can connect with that plus tap into any other connections &amp; resources there. Yeah, doing that would be online not in person until you dig a little deeper. But I think you would like what you find there.",2025-10-10 04:37:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o2rl2i/uni_loneliness/
1o2j09g,deaf,Opinions on AI Sign-Language Tools,"I've become a go-to person for accessibility questions at work, mostly because I'm always advocating for more accessibility mindfulness. But here's the thing I've learned: my own lived experience with disability doesn't make me an expert on every disability community. So I'm practicing what I preach... When you want to understand something, you talk directly to the people with that lived experience.

Recently, someone asked me about [Sign-Speak](https://sign-speak.com/), an AI-based service that claims to provide real-time digital ASL interpretation. I can see potential benefits and drawbacks, but honestly, my perspective matters less than yours.

For those in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community and professional sign language interpreters: What do you think about this technology? Are you excited about AI interpretation becoming more available, or does it concern you? I'm genuinely curious whether you see this as helpful progress or something that might make it easier for hearing people to skip providing real accommodations.

I really appreciate any insights you're willing to share. Thank you for helping me (and hopefully others reading) understand this better.

*Stay awesome.*

We will probably remove any further posts on this topic for a few months as this subreddit can become overcrowded with people asking ""oh have you considered this new technology for the 1000th time????"" if we don't.

Please report further posts of this nature as ""AI"" or similar and we will make a judgement whether enough time has passed.

Absolutely not interested in AI in ASL ever. We require human beings. AI and ASL is nothing more than hearing people trying to not learn ASL.  There is nothing you can say that would change my mind. AI lacks soul, would lack the ability to provide non-manual markers, it would fail in every regard and fail the deaf community.

It’s a huge no for me. I’m barely interested in automated speech-to-text due to the error rate, and the newness of softwares like Sign-Speak means an inevitably higher rate of error/innacuracy. 

Rikki Poynter did an [ad for SignSpeak](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rikkipoynter-1b94171ba_ad-signspeakpartner-activity-7342278337962176512-CDkR) where she demos using them to auto-caption her videos, but if you pause at the right time before she corrects what Sign-Speak generated for her, it’s pretty nonsensical. The software hasn’t figured out how to differentiate signs based on context, and even makes pretty big errors (caption vs count). 

Moreover if you look at the samples the official Sign-Speak website provides, it’s pretty disingenuous. They aren’t showing how the product works in real time, but portraying how it would *ideally* work in hyperspecific situations, using the people who trained the models/software as the sample providers. 

The speech to sign avatar looks uncanny valley-ish, like an interpreter suffering a low bandwidth. The sign to speech sample just displays the text already on screen, with no demo of potential lag time, real-time correction, etc. 

These kinds of AI softwares are also going to put all the more onus on deaf people to conform to hyperspecific styles of signing so that they can even be read correctly by the software to begin with (since it can’t adapt to context, regional variations, slang, jargon and special signs created by individual deaf people working within certain fields, etc.). They won’t be able to collaborate with the avatar-interpreter in order to create sign names/abbreviations, and the avatar will not be able to ask for clarification on anything. 

If the deaf person gets lost in any way—whether they don’t understand a topic being discussed because of poor interpretation or poor internet connection—that impacts how others perceive their intelligence and capabilities. 

It’s all around a bad deal for deaf people, and a cost-saving maneuver for hearing employers. If the deaf person sinks instead of swimming, the employer has an easy out and says they provided reasonable accommodations (this AI interpreter) and can fire the deaf employee. Then the deaf person has to undertake the legal fees of fighting it and find a way to indisputably prove that AI was insufficient, and/or that auto-captioning was insufficient, etc., which the vast majority of us can’t do. 

If you’re arguing for language access, you have to argue for access to *real* and *full* language. If it’s unacceptable to communicate solely in auto-captioning to everyone, why is it acceptable to do so with the deaf employees? If it’s unacceptable to communicate solely via glitchy AI avatars to everyone, why is it acceptable to do so to deaf employees? Why do deaf employees get AI interactions instead of human interactions? 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

AI is limited to what it trains on, and the mainstream is full of ignorance and misapprehensions about signed languages and Deaf culture. 

Currently, unless it’s being developed, coded, and programmed by native signers, it will fail for this reason. Even unconscious bias from well-meaning hearing nonsigners will have a negative effect.

AI hallucinates and cannot be trusted with something as simple as recognizing that “February 29, 2013” is a date that doesn’t exist. It is nowhere near the level it would need to be for effective signed language interpretation, no matter how many greedy techbros are ready to make money off it.

Oh hell no.

Absolutely not. Like a lot of things that have to do with AI, the goal seems to be saturation and money, not providing an actual benefit. So many in that space that cannot be trusted.

My fear is the hearing community could use AI to further the so called 'advantages' of paternalism - eg the eventual eradication of the Deaf, perhaps under what could be seen as new and cleverly constructed forms of fake benevolence. I agree that AI has its uses and could be a great asset to the Deaf but at the same time, it needs to be remembered there are nefarious elements out there who do not wish to have anything other than a fully fledged hearing/speaking society through AI - combined with other factors such as robotics etc. The number of hearing vs the number of Deaf simply means its wholly outnumbered en masse, hence in order to even elevate an equality on a like-for-like basis, the Deaf would need to work even harder than before to prevent the tables being turned through clever use of AI. Essentially such hegemony never goes away thus AI is simply not about having readily available interpretation or instantaneous transcripts as many seem to think. In that sense we are already failing the first hurdles on that road. As one other (u-lala-lation) has put it, its a case of sink or swim - and illustrated how employers could use AI to push the Deaf aside in any process where inequality/discrimination might have arisen.

I don't have any experience with this, as ASL isn't my country's SL, and I keep meaning to learn BSL, but other health issues have got in the way.
So I want to be clear that right now, this is not a technology I would need to rely on, so I don't want to suggest something that someone who would need to rely on it, would find to be a bad suggestion.
So I'll talk more about the topic around the tech, rather than the tech itself. And I'll use my experience with subtitles, because that's what I'm experienced with.

The obvious best case solution, is to have hearing people using ASL more, and to have interpreters available when needed.
Unfortunately, we live in the real world, and neither of those is a thing.
I could see people needing to rely on this kind of tech, purely because they have no other option - there is no interpreter.
And when that happens, the abled world shifts. It decides there's a solution, so it doesn't need to work on *real* solutions.
And it will only improve it so far.
Look at subtitles, and especially generated captions.
They're bad. Still.
Google can't caption English, the language of its primary workplace, yet it's decided it can now caption and dub other languages. I dread to think what they're like!

Often, subtitles will be so incomprehensible there's just no point, and that's from someone who has above average hearing, so I can at least pick up on vocal tone and try to guess (I have auditory processing disorder. Most of what I watch is clear spoken with a good microphone, with only one person speaking at a time, most of the time.)

That's when I speak the same language as what I'm watching, English. I do watch a lot of foreign language stuff, and that's different.
With the same language, if you have some hearing, you can hear where the words are, though obviously there's a spectrum. But SLs aren't English with a hand alphabet. They're totally different languages, so you lose any other supplemental methods. I can't use lip reading if I'm watching something in Korean and using English subtitles, for example.
Subtitles have been bad for decades. They've only got worse, because companies use automated methods. And because they want to be able to pick up proper nouns correctly, so, rather than make a closest sound guess at a word it didn't pick up properly, it will just insert some letters that might have been in it, as it thinks that word wasn't this language, so it must be a name, or a word from another language.
I can't even imagine how bad it will be when it's deciding sounds are random, unrelated words, and putting signs in that then change the whole sentence.
Sure, subs can change the whole meaning of a sentence, but more often, it's a random collection of letters, so it's obvious that it's just failed completely.
I don't know ASL, so I don't know the grammar, and how much a single sign could really convey.
Like, if subtitles messed up a couple of English letters, we'd get a nonsense word, or a different word.
If they mesed up a single Kanji, we'd get a whole word, and sometimes a concept that conveys more to the sentence than just a word.
I don't know how much signs can convey beyond just words, as I'd kind of expect them to short hand some more language into them, simply because of need for a certain speed, and length of making a sign compared to speaking.

So my worry would be that it would be a very poor substitute for a human interpreter.
And that hearing folks will decide it's enough.


Then there are the general issues around AI.
You need a lot of data, so I can't imagine they just hired people to sign out a load of stuff in front of a camera.
It's most likely that they used other materials. Though there's certainly less signed material available online than, well, just reddit for text.

There's also the obvious issue that when people in charge think they've solved a job, and can do it with AI, the humans that would have done that job, no longer have jobs.


I personally think a good idea would be to suggest some people at the company learn ASL.
If you have customer facing staff, give them the first shot.
Have the company pay for courses.
Explain to staff that having ASL on their resume will look good. When going for customer facing roles, they'll be able to point out that they can help a company fulfil it's ADA requirements more easily, and make Deaf/HOH customers and staff feel more welcome there.

It's a boost for your company, and it's a boost for staff who want to do it.
For extra convincing the penny pinching bosses; learning new things makes us improve at things we already do, in multiple ways.
It creates new synapses and pathways in the brain.
That means we get better at everything we do that involves thinking. For SLs, that's also spatial, so if your company has people using their hands, or doing things like 3D visualisation, that will improve simply by learning ASL.
Learning new things also gives us a dopamine boost especially if there's a chance for higher pay down the line thanks to a new skill on your resume!).
Dopamine boosts make for happier people, makes for more productive people.

It will help any DeafHOH staff with communication, obviously. That means better facilitation stuff (business speak) between staff members.

If a number of staff are allowed to go on a course together, that improves bonding, which helps businessy things. Sorry, running out of steam hehe!

There are no downsides for a company spending the money on staff learning new skills. Companies pay for that all the time.
There are some pretty good upsides to it.

Sorry, this got long. I struggle with communication, so tend to over explain stuff.
I hope it helps!

Realistically, I see it going the same way as automatic speech recognition, where it was really bad at first but, after years of iterative progress, is now usable in 90% of situations and has been approved by the FCC.


Likewise, it is going to face serious resistance by the community. However, it would be naive to think we can close Pandora's box after it's been opened. The most we can do is delay its adoption.

I just saw Sign-Speak this week at M-Enabling. 

What I liked was that it could “read” ASL, and produce text captions for the hearies. It is the first tools I have seen do this and I appreciate the approach. (It will also translate spoken English to ASL via an avatar).  

While I much prefer human interpreters, it was nice to see something that was at least partly equitable.

To be honest I like the concept of AI interpreter means no more wait for a real human being. In my area, we have a high rate of ""interpreter shortage"". Interpreters not showing up occurrence more often.  Not like we can sue to whowever that need to provide asl accommodations left and right. It's just a systemic thing. With AI interpreters, it can solve the stop gap.

It is not meant to replace the in person interpreter entirely. 

In retrospect, we should welcome it, own it, and improve it.

$500 for a product no other company has gotten to take off is ridiculous. Smart glasses get launched every few years by a different company, they act like it’ll be the next big thing, and then it silently goes out of business when the early buyers review it and people learn they don’t work as well as the company claims; these ones will go the same way.

$500 I’d extensively look into reviews and reviews in this subreddit cause I haven’t anything positive about any transcribing glasses.

Here's some tee for ya...
I got this glass under beta testing couple years ago, provided so much of feedback, they underwent so many iterations, had labelled it as poor man's glasses or how these would help poor deaf kids to grow well in an abled classroom...and then at the end they make it for US audience at a whopping rate!!! And also the subs model! I mean I understand that it's all business but hey don't start off with a vision of helping folks and then pivot to money making business. 
Also, couldn't wear this for too long - could only get used to reading on the small screen for a while.

The key aspect is to have the microphone as close to the speaker as possible. How do you mean glasses could get a meaningful input?",2025-10-09 16:55:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o2bbw2/transcribeglass/
1o2aqf3,deaf,Genetic testing,"3 generations of hearing loss in my family, but with all different patterns of loss. I was born HOH but never got much work up for the cause, have been wearing aids since I was 7 but have recently gotten curious about predicting how much my hearing loss will progress. I have consulted ENT and AuD but would be interested in others lived experiences. 
What experiences have people had with genetic testing for hearing loss? If you have found a genetic cause for your Deafness, was that helpful in planning your life? 

[댓글]
My hearing loss is probably genetic, though I'm the only one in my family with this type of hearing loss and the only one in my family that had hearing loss at the age I did (teens).  I was born hearing though and in the process of getting cochlear implants this past year I learned that my anatomy is weird. Among other things my cochleas only have 2 turns instead of 2.5 that's typical.  

Here's the thing though, insurance doesn't cover genetic testing unless it's directly relevant towards treating a disease, and there are over 600 genes that can contribute to hearing loss. So I've never looked into it.

No the only thing I could come up with is my egg donor took a morning sickness medication while pregnant with me. This was in the 70s and the medication was shortly after pulled off the market. There’s no other history of hearing or birth defects in my family.

My son is HOH (dxd age 22mos) and he was genetically tested by recommendation of his Pediatrician.  His hearing loss is caused by Connexin 26, which was only discovered 10 years prior to his diagnosis.  We were happy to find the cause, it is non-syndromic and usually doesn’t progress much until middle age.  It also led us to discover his sister is also HOH due to the same gene.",2025-10-09 16:32:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o2aqf3/genetic_testing/
1o24460,deaf,"Working with a deaf girl, any advice on how to make her feel welcome and okay?","My university is organizing a huge event and a bunch of people are volunteering, we needed one extra person with certain graphic design skills and I recommended her because she was so good at it. I have known her previously through mutuals but we’ve never really been that close to warrant any interaction. She was very happy i thought of her and immediately said she’d help. We had a meeting with everyone a few days ago, I told the managers that she’s deaf and that we have to be considerate. Everyone asked me how to make sure they’re not being mean or anything so I told them just to speak slowly and a bit loud so she can understand. However, she was very quiet and she seemed a bit uncomfortable, and she even told me she’s leaving because her head is starting to hurt. I wonder could it be because there were so many people and they were speaking over each other and it was super loud? I thought it was maybe something someone did. I told her we should hangout and work on our proposal of said event, we met up and everything actually went better than it was, but i did pick a place where there wouldn’t be a lot of people and is known to be  calm quiet place. We didn’t end up finishing all the work we needed to, so I said that’s fine we can finish it over the phone tmrw or any other day. She told me she can’t hear phone calls or voice recordings but that one of her family members can listen and tell her. I totally understood that and told her perfect we can work through that. Anyways, I’m her team leader and i want to make sure she’s as comfortable as possible with everyone because during meetings we are very social and i noticed she tends to isolate herself sometimes. What can I do to make her comfortable? Would it be okay if i opened up the topic of all this to her or would that make her uncomfortable? What things should I say to my team to help her feel in place with us, and any ideas on how to work best with her, anything I should avoid or not do? 
Thank you in advance. I know this was long but I really just want to make sure I’ve accommodated myself and my team to make her feel comfortable with us since this is a group effort.

\&gt;told them just to speak slowly and a bit loud so she can understand.  

Oh fuck,  um, no.  (Unless she told you that herself this is horrible advice) 

\&gt;  so I said that’s fine we can finish it over the phone tmrw or any other day.

I'm glad you're here asking for advice because this is a common faux pax that people make, our ability to use the phone varies and we'd rather not make phone calls generally speaking. 

\&gt;  i noticed she tends to isolate herself sometimes. 

NO. My own mother accuses me of the same thing at family gatherings.  You're being inaccessible to her. 

\&gt; Would it be okay if i opened up the topic of all this to her or would that make her uncomfortable?

Don't make her the meeting topic, but you can discuss it privately with her. (can you imagine how you would feel if you were in her shoes?) 

You're going to have to talk to your friend/acquaintance and discuss her specific needs. Deafness is a spectrum and with out knowing more about her I can't really advice on specifics. However from your description your meetings sound like a free-for-all of overlapping voices and a cacophony of noise. If you had more structure to your meetings and made them less ""social"" where only one person spoke at a time, it would probably do wonders for accessibility.

How much time do you have?
How long will you work together?
Does she sign? Is so, what language?

Get everyone to load Cardzilla on their phones to do speech to text 

Hold all meetings on zoom or similar with captions on

Get an interpreter 

Learn sign.

No one here can tell you exactly what she was feeling or needs, but you can ask her privately.

I feel I should share a bit more information so you have a general idea going in. 

It varies from person to person, by as a general rule, by not singling them out and treating them normally until otherwise asked. 

For most dhh, me included, talking louder and slower actually makes it much harder for us to understand compared to normal speech - and that’s if she lip reads. 

Not all deaf/hoh sign/lipread. Everyone is different.

Good: Quiet areas, talking one at a time/not talking over people, facing her when speaking, good lighting. Access to transcripts, captions, and interpreters if needed.

Bad: Talking too loud/quiet, talking with food in your mouth/covering your face, over-enunciating words, talking while walking away, “I’ll tell you later” if someone asks for clarification, assuming what she can or can’t hear.

On a more personal note, if this happened to me I’d be embarrassed and feel ostracized. I also wouldn’t be able to understand anything and I would’ve left early as she did, I would be overwhelmed or upset. I would also be upset if someone told others I was deaf without asking, that’s my information to share. You shouldn’t be having conversations about her without her knowing or being involved.

I’d prefer if you had pulled me aside privately to ask what worked best for me and what I needed, or I spoke to you, then I’d tell you what accommodations work best. 

I would prefer text communication or written, but there’s not a great way to avoid dinner table syndrome. There’s very few ways to keep up with more than 2 people talking at a table. Captions, interpreters, and more only go so far. 

For example, I would personally ask for transcripts/recording and a presentation style meeting, an overview/bullet list of the meeting beforehand, and an interpreter.

Most of us have the exact same experience very regularly, and it is interesting how hearing people so often just don’t understand. You haven’t been in her shoes, so it’s natural, but it still genuinely is fatiguing to us to try to patiently work through these situations. I’m not really sure what to say to be as helpful as possible. I’ll just list a few bullets, and hope you can work from that. I’ll base it on my own hearing level, and it should be noter that experiences can vary - a lot.

* Hearing aids and CI helps when: Quiet environment, you see the person speaking clearly and the distance to the speaker is short. (Any noise or unclear voice can make the conversation go from hear you perfectly to not hearing you at all.)

* Hearing technology doesn’t know what we want to listen to, which means several sounds at once is just noise.

* Hearing aids can only amplify, not remove the hearing loss. Amplified sound can therefore quickly become noisy without necessarily becoming any clearer.

* I don’t do phone calls. Period. (Why? I tried to be nice and lost a lot of money in conversation with my bank. Plus, it’s exhausting and people treat me awfully when I can’t hear.)

* Just change your mindset about what communication is. Learn sign language. Offer a zoom/teams meeting with captions - and make sure you learn exactly how to make them work. Use interpreters, use CART. Use pen and paper. Use chats. Basically, anything whatsoever that doesn’t rely on me having to hear you.

* Processing sound isn’t effortless and automatic to us. Hearing what someone says requires active focus. We can only make out cognition do that for maybe 20 minutes before becoming fatigued and needing a break. (See Rönnberg 2013 Ease of language listening model.) In short working memory is used for processing the sound, instead of being available for information processing.

* we feel extremely frustrated by being in a group of people and being forced by social norms to look engaged and enthusiastic and nod at the right moment, while we can’t hear a thing of what people say and just make good guesses for what to to when. It’s absolutely exhausting. And as HoH don’t frown automatically when you try to interpret the speech, because if you do that and it takes a millisecond too long to reply, then people will thing you disagree with what they said.

* Basically, focus much more on what’s really accessible. If you can’t buy interpreting services and we have to go by anyway, don’t pretend it’s ok or ”good enough”. It really isn’t, and you need to acknowledge your communication privilege. Unless you really offer accommodations fully, the Deaf person is always at much bigger disadvantage than you want to admit nor accept. You really need to think about things differently, and it’s hard.

If you want to, read a lot about deafness and look for diverse perspectives. Deaf Utopia by Nyle Dimarco, Tru Biz by Sarah Novic, research by Patrick Kermit, and much more. There is information out there, and you just haven’t had a reason to really reflect on deafness at a deeper level. Try to move on from the ”looking for a quick fix” stage.

I will put it straight to the point. 

""Speak slow and loud."" This is an insult to so many of us Deaf/Hard of Hearing people. She is not stupid. She simply is Deaf and cannot hear, your job is to provide and Interpreter for her because you are bringing her in on this project. Look into Boostlingo and Prestige Network you may find someone who speaks English and is a Trilingualist. English, Arabic and Arabic Sign Language.

If she’s fluent in sign language, get an interpreter for the meetings. As lip readers, we get migraines from all the overtalking from every corner of the room. 2ndly, use speech to text apps. 3rdly, don’t be shy to step in and say “hold” when overtalking happens. Friendly reminders to not interrupt. And also friendly reminders to look at her while speaking so she can follow. Also wait for her to realize who is speaking before talking.
Also, FaceTime also has live captions, use it instead of voice calls. I used to be a freelance graphic designer and never did a single meeting. I worked for the team leader and nobody else.  I’m not sure why you need a big team to talk to a graphic designer. It should only be the production leader and nobody else.
With my clients ( high end fashion retail), We communicated strictly by emails.

Ask her how she prefers to work or how she works best. Don’t state it as an accommodation but as a way to integrate her effectively to the team.",2025-10-09 12:05:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o24460/working_with_a_deaf_girl_any_advice_on_how_to/

1o1huix,deaf,Ableist vents I need to get off my chest,"Hello ! Apologies if this isn't appropriate to post and the length.

I need to vent and know I'm not crazy. 
For context, I'm hard of hearing and I wear hearing aids. I'm training to become a hearing aid specialist (whatever the proper term is called in English). I'm in my first year.

Some of my classmates are becoming annoying. They're uninterested in the lessons and talk loudly in class. My hearing aids picks up their voice so I hear their nonsense more than the teacher despite sitting right in front. Even my hearing friends who sit with me agree that's it's very distracting and annoying. 

The class rep made a statement to the rest of the class about it. They did not show any sort of empathy. I tried to tell them about my situation after class and they did not show any empathy, not even ""I'm sorry, I didn't know"", naaaaaah their excuse is that they're bored. Not even ""oh we'll quiet down"". I was on the verge of tears and cried to my friends (I have other crap to deal with). 

Why did they even choose their course if they don't give a sh!t about the deaf community or disabilities in general?? Like get lost. It's a super hard course to get into. As a HoH, I'd rather have someone with empathy than someone who knows how electrical circuits work. 

Also, we all know the ableist stereotype that ""all deaf people can't hear anything!"". Well, if ableist people believe that, then why the fck do they send me voice messages despite the ""NO VOICEMESSAGES I'M DEAF"" on all of my social media profiles ?? Their excuse ? Because they're too lazy to write, they're not even neurodivergent. 
And yes, they're in my class. 
Wouldn't it be obvious that I would hate listening to voice messages ?
Please tell me I'm not the only one who hates them. 

Another thing, as someone who has a bachelor in linguistics, sign language is absolutely a language and guess what, it allows the development and acquisition of language. It is absolutely beneficial for everyone, not just for deaf people. 
I recently saw a petition that they're closing the masters degree to teach sign language (I'm in France) this year. Wtf 
We're also trying to get them to include sign language as part of our curriculum.

There's prob other stuff I was pissed about but can't think right now, thanks for reading and sorry if it's badly written. 

[댓글]
The good news is that most of them will probably drop out by the 2nd or 3rd year of your program, we can all hope.

I know it's a vent post but have you considered a remote mic?  like to clip to your instructor's shirt or on a lanyard around their neck.  Really helps cut down on background noise in a lecture setting.

&gt; Please tell me I'm not the only one who hates them. 

Oh the word you want here is not ""hate"" but ""can't"".

I got bullied by my family and everyone else over the phone.  Just get used to it.  You need practice.  Get used to it.  You need to get used to it.  Get over it.  It's my emotional reaction that's the problem was the overall message and I really internalized it.

That is like asking someone who is almost legally blind to drive on the highway at night.  And then lecturing them for feeling afraid.    No no no.  We cannot hear.  It's not ""uncomfortable"" for us etc.  It's as simple as we cannot.

If they're too lazy to write it down, then what they have to say must not be that important.

Welcome to the club. I have so many similar peeves.

This happens a lot. It isn’t about you, they are just immature and self focused. 

Do you have a blue tooth? You can have the teacher speak in a Mic and it goes directly to your device and filters out their senseless chatter.

Sorry I offered a solution rather than validation. 🤷‍♀️

Having such disrespectful and uncaring classmates in a class you care a lot about and are trying to learn is frustrating beyond words. Totally agree that if they're bored they should just drop the class, or move to sit in the back, there's a reason why you're close to the front!!! And the voice notes.... they say they're too lazy to type so they use voice notes and entirely bypass speech to text technology. The option is right there! Voice notes feel too much like voicemail and , I'm grateful my phone provides transcriptions for voice notes, and voicemails. 
I will never understand blatant and belligerent ableism and audism. I'm sorry that your classmates are absolutely awful and feel no shame in disrupting another student's learning experience. 
Your anger and frustration is entirely valid and it must be exhausting trying to accommodate the hearing people in your life and them not even trying in return.

I understand. Just yesterday I was trying to interact with a cashier that knows me and for the love of Mike this guy behind us stocking products was just slamming the crates on top of one another and even with HAs on, I couldn't hear the cashier and he was standing on front of me. The cashier did speak up and tell the guy to not be so loud. But dude kept on doing it anyway. Its also that time of month so I'm easy to tick off.

Also, hi fellow linguistics person! I did start out majoring in linguistics but the in-person classes I couldn't make due to my disabled daughters schedule at the time. So, I instead used it as my emphasis under the change to majoring in multidisciplinary studies. I hadn't done the class you're describing but another student I knew was and she would definitely agree that it's a tough class. Just reading over her assignments, I applaude anyone going into related jobs like speech therapy or audiology or any other major that linguistics plays into. My mom would always ask questions and when she found out the types of jobs you can get with such a degree she realized how crucial a program like it is to man professions. I hope to go back and maybe minor in it since they finally got a minor set up for it. 

Whats been some of the most interesting or surprisingly difficult classes you've taken so far? I found the history of English to be harder than I anticipated. But applied linguistics was kind of fun really. I got to volunteer work with exchange students. 

Hopefully these other classmates just drop out. Linguistics can be a difficult subject and I don't think taking it lightly will work to their benefit.

&gt;Well, if ableist people believe that, then why the fck do they send me voice messages despite the ""NO VOICEMESSAGES I'M DEAF"" on all of my social media profiles ?? 

It's kind of silly to think that every person is gonna to read and memorize every part of your social media profile. Never assume someone is going to know everything in there, because most people don't read those.

Halo! I am hoping things get better for you, and you can always vent here - we all want to be heard! While you are dealing with this, I would tell you one thing a DEI consultant had told me about how disabled (or deaf people) whenever they are in the ableist system (which is always) you have to be your loudest cheerleader and have to develop a thick skin! This is college and sadly I belive things might continue even at work etc. there would always be few kind, empathetic folks around ya, be with them. They would make you feel lot better but yes, it won't take away the pain or possibility of being with such non kind folks. Take care. People have already suggested what might help you, just one thing I use a pixel phone, so voice messages get transcribed for me - so I don't feel totally left out in the ongoing conversation (family chats, friend groups etc)",2025-10-08 17:59:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o1huix/ableist_vents_i_need_to_get_off_my_chest/

I'm being very terrible at case management when calling a lawyer that found confused himself and tried to get their supervisor when callback later at the day and nothing, no call. Legal aid organizations, and other legal organizations cannot help because of not one of their list they can help. Second, I can't go to see ASL therapist because found unusual activity after someone contacted that I mention their name. I no longer go to see therapist until must to sue to the legal system where based from like a hidden court or controlled agency without my knowledge. Caught the interperter walked out of room to talk doctor possibly. This how health system changed but i was young and feels like dependent but taking some years to learn legal resources. Too late.

If you going run to get information of local legal aid (state is referring a county include fees) or popular firms but same info from few of organizations in Florida. It's not going help that out.

[댓글]
Contact your local Center of Independent Living, they can help you with more resources and can provide ASL interpreter.

So, I’m just trying to understand what you’re trying to say: 

You have been looking for deaf advocate and lawyer that does pro bono for 10 years?  You wanted to sue because something happened 10 years ago?

You tried to contact legal organizations, but they can’t help?  What do you mean by list?  List of lawyers?

You can’t see ASL therapist because you think they told someone that you were talking about them and they got mad and contacted you? That sounds like HIPAA violation. 

What do you mean hidden court or controlled agency? 

You also saw interpreter talking to your doctor outside of the room? 


You want to sue who? ASL therapist? Interpreter that talked to your doctor? Or your doctor that talked to the interpreter? 

You called 911 for emergency and you saw 4 women and you think they know ASL because they were watching you talking to 911?

You think one of women called 911 and try to have them dismiss your emergency?

Hey, have you tried contacting your deaf org or as someone else suggested, a Center for independent living?

I understood none of this.

There is a limited amount of time to file this. You are past it. Most ADA complaints it’s two years. Most HIPPA (health privacy) complaints it’s 180 days. So it’s probably ~8-9.5 years too late.

In what context did you mention someone’s name during therapy? Sometimes that gives them not just legal permission but legal obligation to share it.

Therapy is only *confidential* not 100% secret, so there are certain times when information can be given away about you. I can explain when it’s legal if you’re interested. (I used to be a mental health and substance abuse counselor for many years, so knowing when it was legal and when it wasn’t was part of my job. It might be useful to know that way you feel more confident using therapy again if you need to. It can feel very confusing and unfair if you don’t know all the situations information can be shared and then one of those happens and the doctor shares information.)

One example of when a therapist can share without a client’s consent:

A therapist working in California, there was a court case (Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California). This happened in the 1970’s. A man named Prosenjit Poddar told his therapist he was going to kill a woman named Tatiana Tarasoff. Then he killed her. The court ruled that the therapist could’ve prevented Tarasoff’s death by breaking confidentiality (warning her that this Poddar was going to try to kill her), and that it was more important to break patient confidentiality in similar cases. Because of this ruling, therapists have a legal obligation to protect and warn anyone who a patient identifies they wish to kill or seriously harm. They don’t get in trouble for it and they will get in trouble if they don’t do it and something happens to that person. They don’t need to ask first or even tell the patient they did so. Patients in most states do not have a right to find out if someone reported them under this law if the therapist does not wish for that information to be disclosed to the patient.

This is just one example but there are several. You can also sign away your right to confidentiality. This is often a problem in larger hospitals where they use electronic patient records. Most people do not read (or understand) the paperwork and may sign off on their therapist’s notes being shared with other doctors, admin, etc without realizing it.",2025-10-08 06:32:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o133i4/deaf_floridian_need_help_with_privacy_issues/
1o0zo77,deaf,any swedish people here? I have a question for you,"I visited family in Sweden over a year ago, and part of that was meeting an extended family member who is Deaf-Blind. I'm wondering what your interpreting services are like there? I remember she was able to book two interpreters for our meeting, and had a personal caregiver who was there weekdays. I live in the US, and the interpreting services here are an absolute crapshoot. It's expensive and quite often falls on the Deaf person to book, or even pay for (in certain areas of the country), which isn't exactly legal either, but that's a whole other thing. 

Anyway, I'm just wondering what it's like to book or hire an interpreter for a personal meeting like that. Does it cost money out of pocket? I've literally been thinking about this since we met in August 2024.

[댓글]
Not Swedish but German and what you describe works also for us.

In Germany, deaf blind people get disability allowance and other financial support that they can use for anything related to their disability, hiring interpreters and caregiver assistance.

Our system is amazing and a disaster at the same time 😊

You basically have free interpreting as much as you like for anything that you do at your spare time. Family gathering, hobby or going for a drink with colleagues after work - no problem. Any contact with authorities, including doctor’s appointments, school visits as a parent or whatever is also tax funded. You don’t have to prove hearing level or anything, just contact the booking center and you have an interpreter.

**BUT**

Of course there can be tons of issues in practice.

* If you live in an area with a lot of Deaf, there might be a shortage of interpreters, and they start to limit some things due to budget reasons. (I’m lucky to live in a place where we don’t have this issue.)

* Authorities must have a accessibility budget that covers interpreting, but if they are not used to meeting Deaf, you might run into problems because they want to solve it a cheaper way.

* University is brilliant! That’s the only place you normally have no problems whatsoever and excellent service, and really skilled and passionate interpreters.

* Which makes it weird that you ”almost can’t” get any interpreting for work. Well, if your manager has an information meeting, that isn’t related to your work, then you can get tax funded interpreting. There is a system for applying for a small sum for interpreting for other sources, but it’s so complex and poor that everyone hates it, including the employers. A lot of Deaf are unemployed primarily for this reason.

* If you’re the organizer of an event as a Deaf person, then you can’t get interpreting. You only get that as a more or less passive participant. That means Deaf have some challenges if wanting to be more active and managing events, or for example if becoming a manager at work, then you suddenly loose any interpreting you might have.

* Deaf blind might have good rights for interpreting, but they often can’t use them, because guiding the Deaf blind person to an event is not included. Due to how the system works, there is a risk of being stuck at home with too little support.

Do you read Swedish? I could share some resources if so.

1o0mwj5,deaf,Captions on Social Media,"Hello! I am not hard of hearing or deaf. But I recently heard from someone who is also hearing say that the captions that bounce, like the ones Mr. Beast uses, they are not friendly to the deaf community. As someone who edits videos for people, I am curious what your thought and opinions are on this. I would love to know. If that is the case, I will not use those type of captions in videos. Side note: is there a preferred look of captions that the community likes? Much appreciated! 

[댓글]
As long as the captions stay in the same place and don’t flash one word at a time, it’s good. It’s helpful if the letters have a contrast border so they don’t blend into the video. 

While you’re at it, add the full transcript and video description for DeafBlind and blind people.

I absolutely hate TikTok style social media captions. They are hard to follow and read. Closed captions should look exactly like they do on TV or movies.

I guess its a trend the way they and most social media posters do them, but I really dislike that style and its a strain to read. IMO for captions that are informative and easy to read I'd try to think like movie captions:

\-placed entirely at the bottom or top  
\-full sentences   
\-good contrast from the back drop  
\-if its unclear, or the speaker is rapidly changing, show who is talking  
\-showing non dialogue noises in brackets -Not auto generated text, because it gets a lot of things wrong on translation

Show more than one word at a time, preferably complete sentences if possible. I can't speak for everyone, but personally my brain has a hard time processing each word individually while simultaneously trying to string them together cohesively.

For social media platforms like Instagram, I find that I prefer captions to be in the center or just above the profile name because a lot of time there are other texts blocking the top and bottom parts of the video such as the account name, video caption, etc. 

If it’s a video like on YouTube, then yes, TV-like captions. 

I don’t like when it’s one word at a time, like on some TikToks/Reels I’ve seen or like auto-generated captioning. It’s distracting.

I absolutely hate TikTok style social media captions. They are hard to follow and read. Closed captions should look exactly like they do on TV or movies.

Please use fonts that are legible, like Helvetica or Arial. I can’t stand when these influencers do it to be cutesy and bare minimum, and especially when they purposely use the wrong terms as sarcasm.

I’ve never seen a Mr Beast video so I’m unsure what you mean! I don’t mind if captions move slightly, but it’s difficult to follow when there is a lot of movement and the captions blend into their environment. I also wear glasses!

I’m hard of hearing and the best subtitles are those preset captions found on Netflix and films n stuff. Auto CC really struggles and can totally get words wrong or not at all. Netflix is ok but they condense their captions so sometimes the text will not be what the actor is actually saying. I dislike that. But as I go more deaf I do understand the value of that. Beauty of the English language I suppose.

Please use a clear font that's not flashy. As flashing lights can trigger seizures for some.

Yes, definitely very annoying. With good captions, you just land of have them in the peripheral vision and focus on the actual content of the video. If the captions are unclear, for example autogenerated, or have any weird design, like bouncing, then they suddenly require cognitive attention and totally distract from the actual message. It’s like you do a picture with to many strong colors everywhere in a messy way, or if you produce a soundtrack with tone of distracting sound effects that distract from the content. It’s not impossible to do something like that for artistic purposes, but in 99% of the cases, it just becomes horrible.

I recently watched a short video with full closed captions blocking the face on YouTube. I hate it! I can't see the face. I am not sure which video app he used before posting on YouTube.

Anything that looks different will irk me and will likely make me feel like a slow-reader being spoonfed grains of sand. 

I hope OP will keep it simple with captions. I think the tried and true (looks like tv) is best unless we can each customize it for ourselves. I find most captions are too tiny. I wish I could make them bigger like others adjust volume. Or the captions are hidden under a title, description or some other text. Or they're white and disappear. Or they block out the video. There's so many ways to improve.

Generally speaking that is correct these fancy schmancy captions are, of course, better than nothing but they are not friendly to people who rely on them. (I've not seen Mr. Beast video specifically but I know generally what you're talking about). Not only are they annoying when they bounce or whatever, but they often aren't corrected for accuracy and have very obvious errors (wrong words, homophones, etc). Worst of all they stop and you see a thing that says ""Sound on!"" my first thought when I see that is ""fuck you too!"" 

Since you edit videos you should know and be aware that captions are a relatively easy part of post production, it really should just be part of your post production workflow, If you don't have the means to do it in house it's super easy and economical to out-source it to one of the major players in the industry (such as Rev, or 3PlayMedia and others) 

3PlayMedia is an industry leader in captioning online and they have LOADS of free resources, info and links to other sources of standards and best practices. Dig through their website and take in all you can about best practices.

I see people upset about the TikTok captions, I actually enjoy those. They have enough contrast that I can read them, the ones I see are full sentences with the primary word enlarged slightly so that it goes right along with what is being said as it is being said. I'm just grateful that people are taking enough time to capture their videos.  A year ago, hardly anybody was doing it.

I use captions all the time and some are so fast … Im not a speed reader.

Keep it viewable, not where the caption is, not 0.5 pixels big, and white w/ black border. Bouncing is a no no, and one word at a time is just asking to get cussed out. I like when its highlighter per word, like you can see the full sentence but theres a word bolded or highlighted to show how fast the speaker is talking that way we can adjust our reading to follow it!

I used to work in captioning, and ran a focus group once with Deaf participants when we were testing new software. Interestingly, they didn't even like the ""accepted"" moving/coloured type (used for differentiating speakers, or sometime to avoid obscuring onscreen content). They preferred captions that were clear and consistent, in both colour and location on screen. Easier to read quickly.

Also flashing things and swooshing things can sometimes cause problems for people who've had TBI or concussion. I don't have either TBI or concussion but I do find moving captions make me feel kinda seasick.

I've never seen one of his videos so I'm not sure what you mean by bounce, but if the words are literally bouncing around the screen, they'll be harder to read.

I would say there’s a reason the standard black box with white text remained unchanged for decades for a good reason. The whole point is accessibility.

I like them. I think they add character. I like different fonts for different speakers, CAPS when yelling etc…. Have not had any friends complain.",2025-10-07 18:26:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1o0mwj5/captions_on_social_media/
1o0h58e,deaf,Envoy Medical Receives FDA Approval to Expand Its Pivotal Clinical Trial to Final Stage Based on Submission of Promising Three-Month Data,"

[댓글]
&gt;Envoy Medical believes its investigational fully implanted cochlear implant has the potential to address a massive, underpenetrated market opportunity. Of the estimated 2.8 million U.S. adults eligible for cochlear implants, it has been estimated that fewer than 5% currently receive them. In other words, this data indicates that approximately 95% of the adults in the United States who could benefit from a cochlear implant have not received one. Envoy Medical believes one of the primary reasons for this is that most people would prefer not to have a bulky medical device attached to their head telegraphing their hearing disability, which is the case with current partially-implanted cochlear implants. By eliminating external wearable hardware, the Acclaim is designed to overcome practical adoption barriers that have long plagued market penetration in the cochlear implant industry.

Just the way this whole article is phrased is morally repugnant to me.

Set aside the ""to CI or not to CI"" debate - the sheer blatant profiteering of healthcare is disgusting.

""**underpenetrated market opportunity**"" - fuck off.

I think this also shows why hearing technology is pushed above all else, and sign language downplayed and side-lined. Because for profit healthcare makes some people a LOT of money.

1o0ecwr,deaf,My fiancé keeps invalidating my identity as a deaf person… Is this worth breaking up over?,"My profound hearing loss was discovered when I was super young in grade school, so my deafness has always been a core part of me and how I identify. I used to wear hearing aids, but I rely on lip reading nowadays… so yes, I’m aware that I can come across as “normal” (for lack of a better word) to non-deaf people, such as my fiancé. 


When we started dating, he seemed a bit confused but he was supportive. Like most people, he thought deaf just means zero hearing whatsoever and offhandedly made some terrible jokes about me not really being deaf. I didn’t laugh and simply brushed it off the first couple of times, which was probably a mistake on my part. 


While it didn’t happen constantly, it left a bad taste in my mouth to the point where I had to tell him to stop making such jokes. To his credit, he took it seriously and apologized; I haven’t heard any ignorant jokes from him ever since, but he stills comments on how he views me as hearing impaired rather than deaf even after I tried educating him on the differences and how strongly I feel about that label. 


I think what makes it worse is that we have a mutual guy friend who is blind. He can see well enough to drive and live normally by wearing extremely corrective lenses…  Since he doesn’t consider me to be fully deaf, I thought he would’ve also considered our friend to not be fully blind, but no. He insists that he’s actually blind without his glasses, whereas I can still somewhat hear with or without hearing aids. I kinda understand the point he’s trying to make, but I’m frustrated.

She is deaf and uses ASL. 

I would never turn a child away and have taught children with down syndrome, diabetes, adhd, etc.
But this is a new one for me!

I know zero sign language and have no experience working with deaf children.

I have a few days and hope to learn some things so that I can connect with her (literally on youtube trying to learn the alphabet) and find ways to ensure that she is comfortable and that the class is enjoyable for her.

My classes run back-to-back and I have another class  beforehand, so there will not be time for me to engage with her one-on-one ahead of her first class.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you.

1nzhftn,deaf,"Hearing Damage Anxiety: Is 6 months (25 sessions) of clubbing enough to cause permanent, irreversible harm?","I am 31 years old, and I have recently developed a major fear of hearing loss after a new period of frequent clubbing. I had never done this before, but over the last **six months**, I realized the significant risk loud music poses to my ears, and I am extremely anxious about the damage I might have caused. For now, I don't feel any difference in my hearing. I took many online tests and all said that I don't have any signs of hearing loss. But I worry if this is because I am currently young and this exposure will come to bite me later in my life. 

I have vowed to stop clubbing immediately, but I need some perspective on my situation.

# My Clubbing History Details

I'm trying to figure out the maximum exposure I had. Here are the specifics:

* **Total Timeframe:** Approximately 6 months.
* **Total Visits:** Roughly 25 times this year.
* **Average Session Length:** 3.5 hours.

# My Core Questions/Fears

1. **Am I ""doomed""?** My biggest fear is that I have already caused severe, permanent damage and am now on a fast track to deafness. Is 6 months of this level of intermittent exposure enough to cause this kind of severe, irreversible harm?
2. **Can I recover?** My hope is that the damage I might have done will naturally recover now that I am eliminating this exposure completely. Is this a realistic expectation for the ear structures?
3. **What should I do now?** Should I go straight to an audiologist for a full hearing test?

1nzd5fm,deaf,How would you respond to this?  Advice needed,"I'm negotiating reasonable accommodation.  BACKGROUND: Since we do phone work remotely, our employer wants to emulate 1 room school learning. Two people do their call work from home using their own home technologies.  At the same time, they are in a zoom meeting so they can hear each other.  Since I only have 30% hearing left in 1 ear, I'm physically incapable of using 2 audio sources at the same time.  My doctors say it is impossible. 

Here's how my employer wants to handle it.  I would do 2 sessions instead of 1.  In the first session I  would do paperwork while I listen to the other caller.  In the second session, I would tell the other caller that,since I'm deaf, I will be calling and that they will continue to dial while listening to me.  The first session lets me gather info I need to do my job.  The second session feels like it could be awkward and like I'm on display. I'm trying to find a way to put a positive spin on this while telling an employee they have to do this session with me but I won't be able to hear a word they are saying. 

I'm trying to be cooperative because this really is the best solution my employer has agreed to in 5 months but I can't see how this will play out well with the other person assigned to partner with me in any given week.

1nys62e,deaf,Zoom phone,"Wondering if anyone has experience with zoom phones. I had a Hamilton CapTel phone at my old job but my new job said their infrastructure can’t support this so they are suggesting zoom phone as it offers transcription. 

Is this any different than just regular captions on zoom? I find the captions not great on zoom and the CapTel was surprisingly good. I’m profoundly deaf so I need something with accurate captions otherwise there is not point in getting it. 

I’m curious to hear anyone’s experiences. Thanks!

[댓글]
The captions on zoom for a phone call won't be any better than a zoom meeting. I agree, the captions on zoom aren't good enough for a work phone call.


You'd be better off using some other soft phone and the live captions app that's built into Windows 11. 


Does your employer use Zoom's cloud pbx for their phone system? My employer uses Microsoft's and then they switched everybody that had a phone to soft phones in Teams. I'm lucky enough that my job doesn't include needing to make voice calls. 


I did a quick Google search to see if you can use a cell phone with zoom phone, you can, but calls go through their VoIP app :( so CapTel is out again. 


Here's the good news, if your employer uses Zoom Cloud VoIP, you may still be able to use a CapTel phone (the person you asked just didn't know or care, or both). According to the Zoom virtual agent on their website, Zoom's Cloud VoIP is compatible with the Cisco ATA 191. That's an Analog Telephone Adapter. You'll be able to use a CapTel phone with that. 


Also, InnoCaption is working on an office desk phone that works with VoIP PBXs

Good luck!

Thank you for the response. I believe my employer is moving to, or is already on, zoom cloud VoIP, and I think IT is looking for the easiest option for them so you are probably correct about the ignorance/laziness. I will look into what you mentioned about the Cisco option and mention that to them. I really thought getting an appropriate caption phone would be simple as I work for a large university in a progressive state and have a hard time believing there are no others who have the same accommodation.

I use to work at a place called ""caption call"" and they have people that directly translate what the speaker is saying into the captioned phone in real time and they are strict about being accurate as possible to the employees there. It's primarily marketed towards the elderly but it's useful for hearing loss/deaf users of any age. It's Sorenson Communications CaptionCall. It's federally funded and they have an Mobile app as well.",2025-10-05 16:05:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nys62e/zoom_phone/

First of all, what country are you in? 


Is this a work cell phone? Is your job a desk job or a non desk job?

Depending on where you are, your employer may have a legal obligation to find a solution for you on this. For example, I hear hearing aids so my phone and my work phone are both set up to connect via Bluetooth. I also have a Bluetooth speaker I use that connects to one of the work phones if it's impractical for me to ensure I'm within Bluetooth range (though admittedly this is perfect, even with this increase in volume there is no guarantee I'll hear it lol). I imagine there's tech out there available for your circumstances (a better vibrate, lights etc). 

I would also wonder if you can try a different ring tone that's within a different range? I'm not sure if that would work or is even a thing.

Hey, have you thought about installing an AI receptionist? It can pick up the calls for you so you no longer miss out on many, and it sounds like a human &amp; can book the caller into your calendar.",2025-10-05 09:20:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nyjlyl/missing_calls/
1nye5i8,deaf,Support at nursery/school - what can I do? (UK),"I’m a hearing first time parent to a profoundly Deaf child. She is turning 3 so I’m starting to think about schools and was absolutely shocked to learn that my Deaf child can’t go to a Deaf school. She has cochlear implants and no additional needs. Our ToD basically told us not to bother trying to get an EHCP because she won’t get one. Why should she have to struggle at mainstream school where she’ll be the only Deaf child when there’s literally a perfect school for her right around the corner? Even if she has CIs she’s still Deaf?! It’s making me so so so sad. 

She’s been going to nursery part time since she was 1.5. She can talk (although delayed) and very good at lip reading so it’s easy for people to forget that she’s Deaf I guess. Her ToD visits her on a bi-weekly basis at nursery and gives advice but obviously I don’t know if it’s followed. I don’t know how Deaf aware they are or what they’re doing to help her, or if they even sign with her anymore. I just really don’t want her to be forgotten about, I don’t want her to struggle or feel isolated, I feel so powerless. She’s not eligible for one-to-one support or additional funding. Would it be reasonable to ask for a meeting with nursery just to check in and ask what they do with her? Is there anything else I can do/ask for to help her?

[댓글]
You absolutely can get an ECHP for a profoundly deaf child with CIs and no additional disabilities- that describes a bunch of kids who are currently at schools for the deaf! But your ToD is correct that it'll be difficult to get, particularly if it looks like your child is doing OK without one (often the case for bright kids who are good at masking their difficulties)- you need to be prepared to really fight for it and keep appealing if necessary.
Are you aware of the National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS)? They have lots of resources on their website including a guide to [advocating for your child in early years](https://www.ndcs.org.uk/advice-and-support/all-advice-and-support-topics/education-and-learning/education-and-learning-england/early-years-education-and-childcare-england/advocating-your-deaf-child-early-education) and [applying for an ECHP](https://www.ndcs.org.uk/advice-and-support/all-advice-and-support-topics/education-and-learning/education-and-learning-england/additional-support-england)

Best of luck!

Speak to the NDCS for advice. You can apply for the EHCP yourself and you absolutely should. There are absolutely huge delays with EHCPs depending on your area so I would apply immediately. I'm in the UK and have a profoundly deaf son with cochlear implants who has an EHCP and also a teacher so I've been on the other side too. The EHCP is vital for any school to have additional funding to support your child. I'm afraid you need to prepare yourself for a lifetime of battling the system to demand what your child needs.

Your ToD sounds pretty awful. I'm afraid it's a big of a luck depending on who you get. Does your daughter have speech and language? If her first language is BSL then nursery should absolutely be using sign. You are her parent and have a right to know what's happening at nursery. I managed to find local charities to provide my nursery with deaf awareness training and basic sign lessons before I was able to get my son a suitable space in a deaf school. The nursery should have applied for additional funding already so you should be asking how they're are spending that money to support your child.

The UK has a lot of challenges when it comes to providing support to children with additional needs and I'm afraid it can be an uphill battle but you are fortunate to have a deaf school close by as it's not always the case. I'd also phone the school to have a chat with them as some can also be really helpful to help with EHCPs and applications.

I don't know much but from what you said it seems reasonable to contact the nursery and have a proper meeting. 

It seems odd to me that you as the parent are practically being left in the dark when it comes to her development.

If there are denials from any side don't just rely on word, get it on paper so you can use it for any appeals.

I’m American, so I don’t know English laws. But, I know that in the states a lot of hearing parents of deaf kids with cochlears are told a similar thing. If you push back, then they will provide services. Get as many professionals involved as you can. Written recommendations from them, audiologist, signing specialist, etc, then go in to the meeting with documentation explaining how she needs supports. It’s sad, but they will often steam roll over parents they think they can.

&gt;Our ToD basically told us not to bother trying to get an EHCP because she won’t get one.

Bull. Shit.

I work as a TA and almost every deaf and hard of hearing child I have supported ever has had one. And some children with, in the grand scheme of things kinda mild, ADHD / Autism also have one. I want to stress, that isn't a bad thing - more disabled children need them than get them and your child deserves one.

Go for an EHCP!

&gt;shocked to learn that my Deaf child can’t go to a Deaf school

Admission to said schools can be kinda strange I have heard. Have you checked multiple deaf schools?

&gt;She’s been going to nursery part time since she was 1.5. She can talk (although delayed) and very good at lip reading so it’s easy for people to forget that she’s Deaf I guess.  
\[...\]  
I don’t know how Deaf aware they are or what they’re doing to help her, or if they even sign with her anymore. 

To clarify something - you keep saying ""Deaf"" with a capital D. That implies sign language user. Does she know BSL?

I ask because:

1. It's a great skill I highly recommend for numerous reasons. Even starting now it will benefit her greatly.
2. If she knows BSL she can quite likely get access to CSWs (communication support workers). These are like a halfway house between TAs and interpreters - that translate class content. Even non-BSL signing children. can also sometimes get CSWs.

The fact that you don't know if they sign with her is concerning. This should be something you are informed about. Push for that info.

&gt;Would it be reasonable to ask for a meeting with nursery just to check in and ask what they do with her? Is there anything else I can do/ask for to help her?

Push and push and push.

Do not let them fob you off. EHCP. Ask for a CSW (more likely to get it in secondary, but it can't hurt to ask).

If I may ask, what region of the country are you in? I may be able to give some more specific direction if you can narrow it down to a region.

In case you don't already follow her, check out the instagram account ""Learning Ada's Language"", she is a mom of a Deaf child and does A LOT of advocating for her daughter!

1ny5n08,deaf,SimCom confusing toddler Coda,"Hoping some others have experience with this. My husband and I are both Deaf. Our 2 children (both under 3) are hearing. They are enrolled in early intervention for delays due to prematurity. Our EI worker is HOH and knows a good amount of ASL, but is not fluent. We want our children to use ASL grammar and structure in signing, since it's what we mainly use. Our question is, how do you suggest the EI model do this without sim coming? She has stated that she isn't confident enough in her abilities to speak in English and sign in ASL, although she does okay with simple 2-3 word phrases.  

My Dad is hearing and does okay with SimCom, but I feel my oldest is getting confused when he hears one thing, but sees a sign for another. I feel this is happening too with the EI. He was signing 'shoe' consistently (both expressive, &amp; would look for his shoes when we signed it). Now adding to the phrase, ""shoe where?, or {name's} shoe."" He just stares at us or at the shoe and seems confused.   
  
 I stay at home, so the children only get exposure to hearing people a few times a week (park, music class, &amp; everyday errands). Do you have any good recommendations or similar experiences? TIA!

[댓글]
Best practice according to linguists, SLPs, etc is generally to use one language at a time (as attempted policy, obviously everyone ends up using simcom some of the time). This is less cognitive work for the adults as well as providing more robust single-language modeling for the kids. Can the EI person just focus on English since they have full exposure to ASL the rest of the time?

Also, it's very common for bilingual kids to show some ""delays"" or regression as they're acquiring two languages at the same time. They catch up and have solid abilities in both languages by the time they're 5 or so.

ETA I put ""delay"" in scare quotes because it's not actually a delay, it's normal  bilingual acquisition. It does not look exactly the same as monolingual acquisition, though, so people who aren't familiar sometimes miscategorize the pattern.

My daughter also had a speech delay, and was similarly only exposed to spoken English in school or daycare settings. She's now 14, fluent in both languages, and excelling. 

There were times when she would sign something that wasn't accurate because she knew it to mean an English word that sounded like what she intended. I.e. she might sign ""where,"" when she meant ""worry."" She also used to verbally use gloss as a toddler. 

Again though, at 14, she's thriving. I'm so grateful she had access to ASL only spaces as a young child, because it has become a significant part of her identity.

I would not recommend using SimCom. It is confusing because it is not a language. No one can effectively do simcom.

I definitely would encourage strong ASL skills established, a lot of reading, and strong English skills established by another person if you(the parent) are feeling your kids need more support. You deserve all the support.

&gt; I feel my oldest is getting confused when he hears one thing, but sees a sign for another


I can relate, I'm post lingually deaf and I've never been a fan of simcom. I'd much rather people sign and be patient with my lack of complete fluency (how will I ever get better if people don't) than try to sign and speak and have to compromise their signing or their speech. 


 I'm sorry to say that I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough about early childhood education and development to offer solid advice. Though I wonder, why does the EI person need SimCom, why not use total immersion?  Maybe I misunderstand the need or goal of the EI worker.

Get a teacher !!! Who know asl and English  they can teach ur children

Put SimCom, Total Communication and SSE in the same bucket as Franglais, Spanglish, Denglisch etc.  They are NOT languages. It’s fun to play with mixing two languages together, we all do it, and sometimes it helps to get meaning over, but they are not educational tools.

If an educational professional is persistently and sustainedly using SimCom, TC, SSE etc with a deaf or hearing child, that could be seen as professional malpractice. There are no qualifications in these methods. 

Ask them: 

- What is your qualification in SSE / SimCom / TC?
- How do you know if you are signing SSE / SimCom / TC properly? What is the criteria? What recognised SimCom / SSE / TC quality framework are you using for your work?

1nxpleu,deaf,I want to buy earphones,"I’m deaf in one ear pretty much completely, I was diagnosed last year but recently got my motorcycle license and started riding to work and school I want to buy some type of earphones to listen to music while I ride, are in ear earphones a good idea or would they jeopardize my good ear 

[댓글]
I would suggest the conductive headphones. And don’t play music too loud!

Well one question is - what type of loss is it? If it is conductive (before the cochlear) then you might want to consider bone conduction headphones.

But overall, just don't listen to the music too loud.

There’s motorcycle helmets with built in Bluetooth, why not do both at the same time?

My son is not deaf, but he's a motorcycle rider (he has three motorcycles). He has a [Cardo System](https://cardosystems.com/) in his helmet and he plays music from his phone to it. He originally got it so he and his girlfriend could communicate while riding.

Since my son doesn't have hearing loss, I don't know how the music sounds, but I do know that there's a setting in smartphones that you can change from ""stereo"" to ""mono"" and everything will go through both sides of headphones/earbuds you have (which is how I listen to music with my hearing aid or the Beats wireless headphones because I was born deaf in one ear- there's no cochlear nerve).

ETA: he asked what kind of bike you have. He's got an R1, a Harley Dyna, and a 636 stunt bike.

If you have SNHL and it's not severe or profound in the ear you can hear some in, AirPods might work. (Whereas if it's conductive bone conduction headphones are probably going to work better for you.) They have a thing in the app where you can set them up like hearing aids. They wouldn't work for me but that's what I understand.

One perk about having the frequencies you need amplified louder and the ones you don't quieter is you can get more of the full range of sound in the music without having to turn it up so loud it damages your hearing. Obviously keep your perception of the volume not at loud so much as ""good enough"" so that it's not burning through your residual hearing.

The other perk of these from what I understand from friends is that they have a hearing through mode that can also amplify, so you can play music and also maybe hear that car that's doing weird maneuvers in your blind spot. Cars do all sorts of weird stuff around bikes of any sort as I am sure you know, so having access to some sound awareness can help more with accident avoidance than it does for your average car driver.",2025-10-04 09:36:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nxpleu/i_want_to_buy_earphones/
1nxkypr,deaf,Single-Side Deafness- New to wearing hearing aid: ear molds vs domes?,"I was recently diagnosed with single-sided deafness and was fitted with a hearing aid. However, my device came with a dome instead of an ear mold. I brought this up with my doctor, who provided several different dome sizes, but all of them cause discomfort and pain in my inner ear.

My question is: should I consider switching to custom ear molds? If so, how would I go about getting them through insurance? Alternatively, are there any over-the-counter or specialized products (something I can order on Amazon, Etsy) that could help address the discomfort I’m experiencing with the domes?

[댓글]
i'm bilateral, but i've been wearing ha's for the better part of a decade now. i use domes, and they have a bit of an adjustment period in my experience. if you've been wearing them for a few days to weeks and there's not a size or style that feels comfortable, then yeah, it may be a good idea to try custom molds. they both have their pros and cons though: molds can be expensive (usually), require more care, but are better fit and provide better sound; domes are easily replaceable, come in a ton of varieties and sizes (but they're still not custom), and are a little easier to clean (imo), but their sound quality is worse. 

insurance can be weird about ear molds, but like many insurance things, it's different plan to plan. talk to your audiologist. if it's determined to be medically necessary, it should be covered by most insurance that would already cover ha's.

another consideration is the adjustment period that comes with custom molds. you're going to have one with molds and domes, but instead of feeling like there's only something in your ear canal, molds touch your outer ear as well. if that's a better feeling than domes, go for it! just be aware that there's still a new feeling you've gotta get used to.

as for otc products, i don't know of any that'll help. it's kind of like getting used to anything on your body- if it fits, the longer you wear it, the less you'll notice it.

The advantage of domes is that you can use a BTE with receiver in canal. This is something I wish had existed 20 years ago when I tried a hearing aid for my good ear.  Having the receiver in your canal cuts down on wind noise and takes advantage of the shape of your outer ear.


If it's causing pain you need to go back to your audiologist and discuss your options.

I wish I was only deaf in one ear. Kinda used to be like that till I took a broken walkie talkie in the ear and that was it for me. Been trying to get hearing aids but I’ve got no money or insurance coverage :/

I really cannot imagine wearing hearing aids long-term with the generic power domes I use when I'm getting the mould remade or am switching models or using a backup.  Like yes they fit in my ear, and they work.  But they're uncomfortable, they don't sound as good, they're finnicky to put in and take out, and they completely block up my ear like sealed with an earplug.  

With nice proper hard acrylic moulds it's like there's nothing in my ear almost.",2025-10-04 04:51:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nxkypr/singleside_deafness_new_to_wearing_hearing_aid/

I also hate FaceTime. 
I'd prefere to walk in and make an appointment over caption calling or FaceTime. 

What are ya'lls experiences with captioned calls? Am I just autistic or something like that?

 Idk. I've had miscommunication over text also, so Im stressed about that as well.

[댓글]
I struggle with captions on the phone too especially if my hearing enhancements are on and it's picking up different things going on around me while I'm trying to communicate with someone.

But at the same time, if I were to tell them that I'm deaf, and just make them aware so they understand, if I take long pauses, because I'm reading what they're saying on my screen. I also get this random weird pause in the middle of it all. When I let them know, they're almost in this awkward pause in the middle of it. And their response is always something like ""oh that's okay""
I'm aware that it's okay. I'm just letting you know that. So if I'm struggling, you will know to be patient while I'm trying to write down the information and hear it correctly, and confirm that's what I heard.


Sometimes I have such a hard time keeping up with everything that they're saying and I'm just tired of looking at things all day concentrating and having to constantly explain myself because if I don't I get hung up on. They get frustrated with me or I even have to talk to the manager because of the rudeness that I receive from people when I don't know how to deal with communication.
I'm deaf, and if they could slow it down please 🙏🏽 

I'm just drained after trying to communicate with hearing people.

[deleted]

I'm the same. I really do walk into offices to make appts instead of calling. i will also track down any email within a company i can and it usually gets forwarded to someone who can make me an appt or answer queations over email. I really dont know how societies idea for accommodations for the Deaf and HoH was to continue with captioning calls when everyone has a fkn email.

I hate iPhone's Live Captions for FaceTime, reels, videos, and phone calls. iOS Live Captions with a microphone are slow, delayed, miss words, and inaccurate. I dislike using the phone for calls. I switched to a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra smartphone with accurate Live Captions and Live Transcribe. That is much better than an iPhone. I do have InnoCaption and Nagish apps for captioning calls, but Samsung's Live Captions are more accurate to me. I don't use InnoCaption and Nagish much. I am relying mostly on Ntouch videophone calls. My audiologist can use email to communicate with me over captioned calls.

Honestly it’s become more convenient to just have my iPhone do captions. No amount of “I’m deaf and need some accommodation” will get through to some people

I once had someone tell me to suck it up and just use auto cc on my YouTube videos. Never in a moment have i disliked someone so much. The auto cc is garbage and they insisted they never had a problem with it :/ also i just dont wanna be deaf I’m having a really hard time adapting and losing my ability to understand words.

Which ones have you tried? InnoCaption is pretty good.

I agree, I used it for a week and then put it in the garage.

Captioned calls are fine. I don't *need need* anymore, but I still use them sometimes due to really thick accents. 

IMO works fine. Occasionally a word might be mixed up, but 99% of the time it's very clear what was meant due to context.

Don’t worry - I’m the same

All of us same as u are as different experiences.

They're never *reliable*, and if I'm going to use something for communication purposes with strangers it dang well better be. 

My CaptionCall phone would frequently take incoming calls while having zero connection to captioning services and would give me zero warning that was the case until I picked up the phone. CaptionCall saw no problem with that issue, not the frequent captioning errors - usually at least one per sentence, if not more. I once had someone introduce themselves as ""Scott""... which was captioned as ""God"" not once but three times in that single call.

So no, you're perfectly justified in not wanting to deal with them. I definitely don't.",2025-10-04 02:07:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nxhu51/i_hate_caption_phone/
1nx8k1l,deaf,Anyone have any luck with ssa.gov (United States),"I recently tried applying for ssa disability, since being Deaf/HOH qualifies. They keep calling me and emailing from a ‘do not reply’ address, saying I need to call them (even though I very clearly stated that I cannot talk on the phone). The voicemails they leave me are not transcribed correctly by the vm and the call back number doesn’t accept relay calls.

Has anyone had any luck with their application to them?

[댓글]
Doesn’t accept relay calls or the system times out before the operator/interpreter can transfer the info? I’ve had to redial multiple times with the same operator to learn the menu numbers. 

Otherwise, wait till the shutdown is over and go to an office in person.

I’ve used a digital transcriber on the phone with them. It’s not perfect but it gets the job done. I put the call on speaker and then run the speech to text app on my iPad.  I tell them I’m doing it and to please have patience. I’ve had 100% success over the last 6 years or so doing this.  The other alternative might be to make an appointment and go in person?  I’ve done this once as well and brought my wife with to assist with communication.  

From what I understand deaf on its own can be difficult but not impossible to qualify with. You need to be near 100% deaf and no implants. If you get an implant you only get to stay on for 1 year.  Please don’t take this as legal advice. 

I hope you get it figured out. SS is no fun to get sorted.

1nx86yz,deaf,As a partially deaf person I struggle to make friends.,"Greetings everyone, 

I recently moved to Dublin for work and have been going to a lot of social events to meet people and try to build a social life. 

Thing is that I struggle to keep up with conversation in groups and I make sure that. After the event we all exchange Instagram and go about our lives. 

I try texting the people to hangout again but one on one this time because it’s easier for me to have a conversation and connect. However I mostly get ghosted. Girls get the wrong idea, I have a feeling that they think I’m asking them out or something. 

 How do you guys deal with this? Any advice would be helpful. 

[댓글]
It is really important to explain to others what you need for good communication. People will meet you halfway; if they don't, then they are not worth the effort. That is a great way to filter for thoughtful people who will stick by you. 

Dinner party sized groups of 6 to 10 people or thereabouts are terrible for following conversations. Strangely enough, really large parties are better because one ends up only talking to one or two people at a time because even hearies can't hear with so much music and chatter.  People like ourselves fare better because lip reading skills are perfect for such situations so long there is enough light.

Meeting through a sports activity is another tip. Doing sports together doesn't always require heavy talking during a game, for example. It's easier to establish a bond this way first and then open afterwards socially.

I feel you. Being partially deaf is horrendous. I’m sorta new to it in the last 4 years. I’ve already lost a couple of friends because of it. Struggled at my job till I lost that. People also like to tell me what I can or cannot hear and what sounds hurt me.

Apparently because they manufacter in China (to avoid ethical labour laws and saftey pravtices no doubt) they are unable to help.

They offered no discount to make up for having to effectively pay double for their product.

They clearly are all about profit. I know they made abelist comments a few years ago but here they were openly - screw you for being different.

Does anyone know an alternative where they care about their customers and aren’t abelist ?

I have tried flare but they dont cope with music events because they just dampen sound?

This isn't ableist. As someone also deaf in one ear who also uses loops, there is a point where your behavior becomes entitled. You do not NEED two R's; you get one set of earplugs in a case, you do not need to buy two sets, you do not NEED two R's as you do not HAVE two right ears. Them offering a discount is VERY gracious. Also, you CAN, in fact, put these in the ""wrong"" ear and have them work just fine. 

This all has NOTHING to do with where or how they're manufactured, and it doesn't mean they're ""all about profit"" when they didn't take apart two sets of earplugs to send you.

Someone who lost a leg doesn’t buy one shoe, nor do people buy only one glove if they don’t need the other. I see where you’re coming from, but some things we probably can’t change.

&gt;Apparently because they manufacter in China (to avoid ethical labour laws and saftey pravtices no doubt) they are unable to help.

You were apparently fine with manufacturing in China when you wanted something from them.

I saw a guy on TikTok who has one leg. He found a guy who has the opposite foot missing white the same shoe size and similar style. They just buy a pair and mail the other shoe to their foot buddy! I don't think you will find an ear buddy, but either way I think it's standard to just buy the pair. Also, maybe you could wear both so your left ear doesn't feel LEFT out????

Honestly if they were US based I wouldn’t expect them to send me 2 right ear plugs. It’s going to be really rare that they’re selling 2 earplugs for the same ear making it extremely inconvenient for them. It’d be easier to just find a company that sells earplugs as singles and get those.

That sucks, I'm sorry.

Another brand is Curvd. I've never used them but I've heard good things about the product itself.

I hope you find a solution!

I'm a bit lost. Why does the user need 2 right earplugs?

This is the kind of thing that makes actual anti-ableist work so hard, and makes nondisabled think we’re all just a bunch of petty whiners. 

There is *nothing* ableist about this. Your demand is not something any company should be forced to do. You are not entitled to this. This is not reasonable accommodations. This is not discrimination. You’re being refused because you want something for free, not because of your disability.

1nwhkoa,deaf,"When reading lips, do you look straight at the lips or do you make eye contact and use peripheral vision?","I apologize in advacnce for my ignorance.

[댓글]
I've been reading lips for 40 years and ... I have no idea.

It's a mix of both. Eye contact is important, but I think I only do that when theres a small pause in words or sentences. 

The louder the environment, the more focused I am on the lips.

Strict lipreading isn't a viable way to get your communication.  You need to do what's called speech reading, whereby you observe the face, and body language of the speaker.  This will give you a more comprehensive idea of what's being spoken to you.   Expression, tone, emphasis, nuance ... every little bit of information you can squeeze out helps.

I’m *locked in* on the lips

Right at the lips.  Have been times that I’ve said, “There’s nothing in your teeth, I lip read.”

On the lips pretty much 100%

Lips, but use eye contact once in a while to maintain engagement. Peripheral vision pretty much blocked out unless something big or important happens.

I have to watch your lips move or it’s not helping me at all. Even then there’s errors. If I had to use my peripheral vision I’m getting nothing.

im autistic and dont rly like eye contact. so lips.

95%/5% in favor of the lips.

Lips when they're speaking, eyes when there's a pause or when I'm speaking, upper lip/nose if I'm not sure what's gonna happen next.

I focus on the lips but scan the area and check in with eye contact frequently.

The face and whats going on and lips. It's speechreading. They stopped calling it lipreading because of this misconception

Like 90% lips and 10% eyes. If it’s quiet and I’m alone with someone I’m familiar with, like a family member or my fiance, I can focus less on the lips because I know their voice and speech patterns pretty well. Unless I don’t have in my hearing aids…then it’s all lips, baby!

I do both. If I’m not having a hard time, I make eye contact and use peripheral vision. But if I’m having a really tough time understanding, I’ll look directly at the persons lips.

100% on the lips. Til I start to tunnel vision from so much focus and long conversations that I can barely pay attention anymore. Lol. Side note: I've found i completely lose the ability to focus on what someone is saying if i'm looking at their eyes... which i discovered during the mask/covid era... literally had to look to the side and get my ear as close to their face as I could to even maybe understand anything.

I've been reading lips 100% for 39 years so I don't rely on anywhere else. I just read lips.

Both

Are so many of you lipreaders? I’ve never been able to do it. Not only is only 30% of the language visible on the lips, but I assume my eyesight might be too poor to catch even those details. I do watch the face in general for clues to what’s said, but seeing actual speech? No.

i... can mostly hear if it's quiet, so I generally only need to resort to lip reading when the room is louder. i think I focus more on the lips while I angle my right ear toward them, cuz im not bothered about full expressions or body language when im trying just to understand them. 

lip reading, even for those of us who are pretty good at it, is not 100%. and it works best with the people you know best, like your family and partner, and eventually classmates/teacher or coworkers/boss, but can be a lot harder when it's random people like a barista at Dutch Bros or a cashier at Kroger. it can be hard when someone has an accent that differs from your regional accent that you're used to reading, cuz the mouth movements are gonna be off. a lot of British accent vowels are way different from Australian vowels, for example. which, funny enough, if you've looked at enough gifs over the years, you can pick out who some of the British and Australian actors are playing Americans based on their mouth movements. People who speak English as a second language will likely also have different mouth movements and can be harder to read

I stare intently, disconcertingly at the lips.

JK, I try to take in the whole face and posture.

1. My eyes are crossed so I focus heavy on the lips 
2. If I’m tired I have a mini whiteboard with fine dry erase makers and a mini eraser at the ready. 

Also if they gots a mustache, they lips move weird or not all. Automatic whiteboard. If it’s super noisy = whiteboard. Making an order at a walk-in restaurant = whiteboard. The vibes ain’t vibing = whiteboard.

1nwakbd,deaf,Baha/Osia implants,"Hi! I'm 28F who is severely HOH in both ears. I'm currently trialing the Baha implant for my left ear and will get the osia implants if I feel it is an improvement from the hearing aids. Does anyone have a Baha or osia? I'm enjoying the experience hearing much better with it than my hearing aids, however I'm struggling to recognize where voices are coming from. If you have a Baha or osia can you tell me if that improves when you get the actual surgery or will this always be a struggle just because it's part of having hearing loss? 

[댓글]
I have an Osia.

On the trial, the BAHA has to push the sound through your skin, which is a bit of an insulator, so they have to turn up the microphone sensitivity (the ""gain"") to make sure you hear things. This can cause it to squeal and stuff like that. 

When it's implanted, things are 'normal' levels - sounds are a lot more natural, and it's easier to dial in settings for your loss. 

I can't speak to telling direction - I'm deaf on one side, so I can't tell that all, with or without the Osia.

If both cochlea work (even partially), you have a chance of getting some ability back to locate sound sources. Unlike me, who only has one. This is definitely a question for your audiologist or ENT.

I have a BAHA on both sides and I can hear where sounds are coming from. I notice whenever I’m only wearing one for whatever reason, my speech discrimination drops and I struggle to to locate sounds when I don’t know where it’s coming from. I also struggle more in group conversations as background noise overlaps the one that speaks in front of me or on the “wrong” side.

I have not been and would not be a candidate for a baha, but with most implants telling where sound comes from can vary quite a bit.  With a BAHA or a CI you're bypassing the outer ear, and the shape of our ears contributes quite a bit to sounds above us and in front of us. Also with a BAHA some sound can transfer across the skull to the other ear further limiting the brain's ability to detect direction. 

I got a CI last November and got another less than a month ago. My 2nd CI is in an ear that's been unusable at all since the late 90s. Since it's only been about 4 weeks my brain doesn't' really know what to do yet, sound in general is still very whistle-y and squeaky (on that side). I hope to once again be able to somewhat tell what direction sound is coming from, but it's been like 30 years since I've been able to do that.

I *think* it depends on how much loss you have in both ears. I'm severe in my left &amp; profound in my right, so my BAHA is on the right and transmits sound to my left ear. Leftie is still doing all the work so sounds are just *there*. I got no idea where they come from but at least I can hear a lil better and I don't go totally deaf when I get a cold. Hopefully it'll be different for you if you have some hearing in both ears :)

I have the BAHA. Had it since 2015. It’s going pretty good. The only negative is that sometimes the site gets a little crusty so it feels kinda gross to inspect/clean it, but I’m overall pretty glad I got it. I’d recommend you get the model that doesn’t have any feedback. Mine gives a lot of feedback and it sucks because I have a LOT of hair and it’s always squealing.. 8/10 for me. I still have a terrible sense of direction regarding where voices are coming from so I think that’s going to be a thing no matter what. :/",2025-10-02 17:43:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nwakbd/bahaosia_implants/

Ive met a lot of deaf/mute people and decided I needed to be able to talk to them. I genuinely think a year or a short class at least of sign language should be mandatory in schools because I couldn't imagine basically speaking a ""unknown""  language in my own country.

All that being said, I hate talking. I'm an extremely quiet and reclusive person and someone even just answering a yes or no question takes a lot of effort because it feels like it takes so much energy. Is it wrong for me to use sign language instead of speaking even though I'm fully capable of speech? I have friends, parents, and my boyfriend who all understand sign language so if they ask a direct question and they expect a more than two word answer I could literally just sign it... But I'm afraid that can be taken as offensive? Idk. Lmk what you think

1. I never said anything about teaching ASL? Idk why people are telling me not to do that as if I said I was. All I said was that I'm fluent in it?

Sign language is not exclusive to the deaf community. You’re way overthinking it.

Am I wrong to use english because im not a native english speaker?

Just don't pretend to be Deaf. Nothing wrong with using sign language with people who understand it.

Others can weigh in. But I think there are times that ASL is more effective than spoken English and it'd be great if everyone had a basic knowledge of it. I'd say go ahead and use ASL as often as you like with people that you know understand. Using it with strangers probably wouldn't go so well and lead to awkward situations if they find you do speak.
My only caveate is please don't try to professionally teach ASL. Please leave that job to native ASL signers.

I am fluent in sign language after working in the Deaf community for years. I am autistic and I use it to communicate when I get overstimulated and go non-verbal. My husband has learned a bunch and it really is an amazing language. 

It is, in my opinion, the most effective way of communicating and is the most beautiful langauge in the world. Keep learning!!

Please don't use the word mute, unless someone specifies, it can be derogatory to some. ESPECIALLY with the history of using Mute and Deaf together. Also, you will need to explain you are a hearing person capable of verbal communication, but you prefer sign language, as people may think you are Deaf, do not pretend to be Deaf. This is my personal feeling/experience and thought process.

Use it anytime, anywhere, really. 

Be aware private conversations are not that in a crowded space. Have been accidentally amused at the airports from time to time.

Um. I'm so confused. Why is this even a question?

I’m hearing, so my perspective on this is limited, but it’s my understanding that the use of sign language is perfectly fine and even encouraged sometimes. The issue arises when hearing folks try to teach sign or act like they know the language better than someone in the Deaf community.

I’m hard of hearing with little knowledge of sign. I made a deaf guy laugh unexpectedly by expressing how I felt about this bureaucratic process was bullshit and he cracked up from inside his car. He helped me to find the office building and I saw him again and he signed to me. I assume he didn’t think I would know how to sign bullshit. Haha
It’s just a language, but a powerful one that is non-verbal. You can communicate in a noisy room, or across a distance.

No.

[deleted]

Nope u can use asl however u like

No! It's perfectly okay

You’re using it to help you communicate. If you’re not pretending to be Deaf or using it solely to look cool there’s not a problem

I can speak but find it difficult so I prefer to sign when possible, sounds like you're in the same position, so anyone advocating for me using sign should do the same for you. Why does it make a difference if my speech difficulty is caused by deafness and yours isn't?

My mother is deaf, but does not use ASL. My siblings and I all learned some, and use it frequently to communicate across a room, or in a store or other places where yelling would not be appropriate. We are siblings, we yell at holiday dinners.

1nvckgr,deaf,Any Deaf or HoH students at GMU?,"I am HoH and recently just transferred to GMU(George Mason University in Fairfax VA) and it’s been difficult making friends especially since I can barely hear what they’re saying and even though I ask people to speak up or face me when they’re talking it seems to be to much to do for them. I was wondering if there is any Deaf or HoH students here who know ASL and would want to meet up since I’m much more comfortable with sign (still learning not completely fluent but I can communicate well) since I don’t have to rely on my hearing aids since I don’t like to wear them all the time.

Would that be George Mason University?

Hey! I’m Hearing but grew up with HOH mom and have a few friends who are HOH and are looking for more hoh/deaf friends. I’m transferring to GMU in the fall and currently thinking of minoring in ASL so maybe we’ll run into each other!!

I can put you in contact with some in the area! I’m in Roanoke VA currently but know a lot of college aged kids up in nova who are deaf!

Looks like the ASL club is still active: https://www.instagram.com/aslclubgmu/

Hi! I am also HOH at GMU. I have been struggling to make friends here for similar reasons, feel free to hmu. Theres also an ASL club here that meets every thursday in sub 1. Almost everyone there is hearing tho so it can still feel a bit lonely.

RIT/NTID in Rochester, NY. If you need to pick between Gally and RIT… RIT is more technical/STEM based while Gally is more liberal arts; education, psychology, etc

Boston University has a pretty big Deaf Studies program and MA in Deaf Ed so there’s a good amount of ASL signers and Deaf on campus. 

Other options might be colleges in Deaf hotspots like UT Austin or UCSD. They have robust ASL programs and big Deaf communities. Closer to Michigan… well UChicago has faculty studying signed languages and Deaf communities, so does Ann Arbor… not sure though if they have the student base though

Adj. Prof at Gallaudet here, Gallaudet will certainly give you the deaf culture experience. Unfortunately, RIT/Gallaudet are both based on the East Coast, but RIT seems a bit closer to where you are and similar weather dynamics too whether that is a con or a plus lol

My advice is to visit! Take the time to check out a few schools (local option, Gallaudet, NTID, etc) and then see what fits your goals, interests, extracurriculars, etc",2025-10-01 03:48:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nuy30b/colleges/

Your audiologist will know best which hearing aid and which settings/mapping will work best for your hearing. Different hearing aids have different features and prices. If you have insurance, see what it covers

If you are working and you live in America look into your state’s local vocational rehabilitation services. They can help you with getting hearing aids if you need them for work. They may make you have another hearing test, to make sure you qualify, but you will be able to get hearing aids. I used them in my state as I am going to school and I was able to get good custom hearing aid that matched my type of loss.

Look up the Lion's club in your area.  They have a hearing aid bank and they might be able to help you.  I don't know what the current copay is for it, but I do know that several years ago, I got a set of hearing aids from them.  Then I got signed up with Vocational rehab and returned them for someone else to have access. because DVR ended up paying for different ones for me.  They may not have anything that will work for you.  But it is worth a shot to see if there is anything available.",2025-09-30 21:54:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nuqhc7/hard_hearing/
1nupzot,deaf,Is is wrong that I'm relieved my child can't get cochlear implants?,"My infant has profound hearing loss in both ears. Since finding out, I have dove into the Deaf community and began reading books, speaking with Deaf adults, visiting Deaf schools, and learning ASL. I have researched a lot about CI's and have a general understanding of what they could and will not do. 


Going to audiologists, locating and getting hearing aids, and endless big city doctor visits has been draining me. Having to subject my child to anesthesia for an MRI was difficult for me, and they found that he has no cochlea.


Now they want to do more scans and tests to explore some type of implant in 1 ear, but knowing the limitations and considering how much work and difficulty even a successful bilateral implant surgery could be, I have little faith or will to go down that road. 


I am almost relieved that I don't have to make the decision now..I simply want to concentrate my energy on ASL and written English, among all other normal cchildhood milestones. 

[댓글]
No, it's not wrong. Your child will not be less for their Deafness. And you are doing all the right things. You are ensuring they will have access to language, to expression. You are working in advance to ensure that they will be comfortable and loved. 

We chose not to do the Cochlear implant for our daughter. We had the option to and chose not to. I regret nothing. 

Love your kid and you're doing just fine.

I don’t think it’s wrong — it’s a natural reaction imo to feel relief that you don’t have to make a difficult choice about an invasive procedure and all that comes with it, esp since you’ve already made so many of those already. It sounds like you are doing everything you can to provide your child with access to language, good on you as a parent for doing that

I'm a coda and a speech-language pathologist. You are not wrong. You want what's best for your child. The process to get CIs is scary, and it's fine to feel relief. It would be worse if you were upset and unable to do anything about it. I am glad that you are learning to sign, and integrating in your local deaf community. Your daughter needs language now more than she needs sound. Keep it up! You got this Mama!

My son is single sided deaf, and also not a candidate for a CI. I was relieved that we didn’t have to make that decision.

No, it's not wrong. Feelings aren't ever right or wrong, for one thing, and anyway you didn't cause the situation and can't control it. Being relieved to have the decision taken out of your hands is normal.

Hooray for diving into ASL!

If kiddo has no cochlea, WTF are doing wanting to put a CI in a part that doesn’t exist???  🤦🏻‍♀️ 

THANK YOU for everything you’re doing, with signing!!!  That is THE best thing ever!!  Hearing parents teach their hearing kids sign language, &amp; it should be inexcusable to deny a deaf/Deaf/HoH kid communication access!!  It’s wonderful to see how much you’re doing!  Kiddo will pick up writing, reading, &amp; ASL!!  Bilingual is awesome!  😉🤟🏼🫶🏻

no it’s not. my mum insisted i have one anyway and it did so much damage to my life.

My wife had to make a difficult decision for her deaf daughter. There just aren’t enough teachers for this in our area and she was not advancing at all. She ended up getting the implant done and the incision was so much larger than the doctor alluded to. My eyes welled up when I saw it. Fast forward six months: it’s helps her a lot with situational awareness but I couldn’t tell anyone they should do this.

I went for a hearing test recently and this first thing the audiologist said (before even doing any tests) was 'we think you need cochlear implants.' So fast off the mark! I refused outright despite their insistence. In my view being hearing and part of an overbearing speech society is not always a good thing and it is good that people can have choices. The problem is paternalism tries to coerce the Deaf into thinking being hearing (wearing hearing aids or having CIs) is good but its a multi billion industry that has what can be termed full assimilation at heart. Its society that needs to change - not the Deaf.

I wish many people were like u. Identity is important,  especially for a deaf young child. All that Dr. Fixing is unnecessary.

I don’t think it’s wrong at all, it’s each to their own imo. If u want you or your child to have a cochlear implant (if it is possible) then that’s okay, just as much as it is to not want the CI for you or your child. For me personally, when the time comes and if I’m able to/need it, I’ll be getting a cochlear implant, something I’ve discussed with friends, family, and audiologist (I am learning BSL in addition because even now I don’t wear my hearing aids all the time and I imagine I won’t wear my CIs all the time either😂). And that decision is just as valid as someone else who was in my position and didn’t want them.

Champ 🤟🏻🤟🏻

It’s not wrong. Lots of ppl saying no point to have a CI as we have already our sign language and language interpreter exists which is true. Hospital just wanted all deaf to have a CI so they don’t have to sign anymore, really silly as it’s not up to hospital.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Cochlear implants require a ton of habilitation or rehabilitation depending on the case. If that is not something you see in your or your child’s future, you have made the right decision

It absolutely isn't wrong to not want to put your child through that.

Most hearing parents of Deaf kids do not do the amount of research that you have done, nor have they learned ASL. They follow the recommendation of their doctors and medical professionals. That recommendation is almost always early implementation.

I've never known an audiologist that signs. They are taught that technology is the solution, that sign hinders speech.

Remember, as the parent, you can always say no to further testing.

I wish all the success in learning ASL with your child, and becoming part of your local Deaf community.

Absolutely not. I am a big advocate for parents doing what feels right for them and their child. But making sure that child has a good connection to language. 

I work with deaf and hard of hearing kids and I am deaf myself. Hearing parents including mine are always worried if they made the right choice or not. If you feel that a cochlear or hearing aids are or are not the right fit for your child right now, that’s fine but as long as you are still ensuring he has access to communication, which you are doing by learning the local sign language.

You are doing great!!!

It can be overwhelming but just trust yourself.

No, it's not a bad thing to be relieved you're off the hook for making a decision about whether or not your child should undergo a major surgery with intensive follow up (that will hurt and take considerable time out of their life and other activities) and that doesn't work for everyone. That's honestly a lot of stress for your kid and a lot of stress on you making that decision. A medical reason that removes some of the hearing society pressure to do that off your shoulders is of course going to feel like a relief. Some hearing parents who don't really want to do CI feel pushed into it by hearing culture and social circles and so a medical reason gives you some insulation from that. It's okay. As you know, many deaf folks live wonderful and amazing lives, and CI can be a nice tool for some deaf.... but it's never been a requirement for a full and wonderful life.

🫸🏼🫷🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 it’s OK to say no to CI!!

[removed]

How do they know how bad a baby's hearing is?? Suppose the baby isn't that deaf and they put real strong hearing aids in, and when the baby cries because it's too loud, do they say ""Well, the kid has to get used to them."" That's crazy!!!! Just like when they put those magnifying glass thick glasses on a baby, how do they know the kid can see clearly? They should wait until the kid is old enough to tell the doctors themselves.

I mean, it's a little weird. You had the option to give your child access to 2 worlds, but you feel better that they are more limited now?

You should also look into cued speech. Cued speech and ASL can go very well together! CueSign is a great organization (I’m on the board).

1nuo724,deaf,Best AI Live Speech-to-Text App for Deaf University Student?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a deaf student just starting university, majoring in IT. Lectures are often fast-paced, with the teacher talking most of the time. I’ve been using Google Live Transcribe, which helps a bit, but it sometimes becomes really messy, inaccurate, or mixes things up, especially during fast or complex lectures.

I’m looking for a **mobile speech-to-text app** with the following requirements:

**Must-have:**

* AI-powered transcription for smarter, more accurate results
* Live, real-time transcription (like Google Live Transcribe, the text displays on screen)
* Reliable for university lectures and studying

**Must-not-have:**

* Apps that record audio first and then convert it to text
* Apps designed mainly for casual chatting with friends/family

Whether free or paid, I really need an app that will help me follow lectures and study effectively.

Do you have any recommendations? I really appreciate any help you can provide.

[댓글]
Every year 3play Media does an unbiased State of ASR report. you can find it on their website. 

Microsoft has been a leader for a while now with Google's API a close second. You should request that your school provide CART with a live captioner. You're paying too much in  your tuition to get anything less than equal access.

I’m a fan of otter or google slides BUT you might be entitled to live transcription services through your school depending on what country you live in, as an accommodation

Hi! If you are an app developer and would like to promote your app on r/deaf, please check check with the moderators first! Please disregard this if that isn't the case. Thank you!

Try this one https://recapp.work

SLAIT.AI is doing good things. Look them up or I can link you their website

Edit: also Sign-Speak. Im just not sure if they have voice available yet.

yeah live transcribe messes up once the prof starts talking too fast or people jump in at the same time. i’d try notta or whisper-based apps—they’re better at punctuation and context. and for cleaning up saved recordings or turning them into readable notes later, uniconverter actually does a solid job processing the audio before you re-run it through your main speech-to-text app.

Hey i am building what ur kind of looking for i would apreciate if u w'd like to be a beta tester when i'm finished but I'm building on Windows,Mac and Linux so mobile I'll see later

Hey! 👋 My team is currently building an app specifically for Deaf and HoH students - it’ll have live transcription, speaker labeling, and an AI summary after each lecture to make studying easier.

Would you be interested in joining as a beta tester when it’s ready? Your feedback would mean a lot. TIA",2025-09-30 20:25:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nuo724/best_ai_live_speechtotext_app_for_deaf_university/

1nuemp7,deaf,Fire alarms for Hard of Hearing,"My wife uses hearing aids and the other evening we went to bed, and she took them out to charge. We were falling asleep and one of the smoke alarms in the TV room started going off (everything was fine) but she could not hear it.

I have been searching for a system that would not only have sounds but also some sort of visual flashing, that would be integrated throughout the house so if something happened in the garage, she could know upstairs if she is by herself. I have been researching but most of what I am finding are individual alarms that have flashing lights, but that only helps if you are in or near that room. Also, the pricing seems steep, thought I am happy to pay for the safety if that is the reality of what it costs.

What do you recommend? I would need seven units, only one of mine is hardwired, so the rest would have to be battery. I am religious about changing the batteries every six months so that does not bother me. Any brands or systems out there that are good?

[댓글]
No guarantee but your local fire department may provide one to you at no cost. They did for my child. Adults may be different.

They are expensive! Kidde brand in the US makes both battery run and hard wired flashing smoke detectors.

Bellman and Symfon is where I've got all mine from. I have one fire alarm (they're really sensitve) linked to my vibrating bed pad and alarm clock with strobe, the strobe in the front room with vibrating sofa pad the kitchen strobe and the portable one for the bathroom. They are fairly expensive but I find it great! I have the bellman visit integrated for the door bell too. It's a bit over the top for a 1bed bungalow but better safe than sorry

They do make led strobe smoke alarms for houses.

There are many assistive devices for the deaf including flashing light systems for audios like alarms and door bells.",2025-09-30 14:25:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nuemp7/fire_alarms_for_hard_of_hearing/
1nudedx,deaf,Gift Ideas for Deaf,"I wanna gift my deaf teacher something for Christmas... he's a really good teacher and teaches really well and makes sure I can always follow the discussion... so even though we are not close, I’d like to give him something to show my appreciation. Do you guys have any gift ideas? I would really appreciate your recommendations! 🤗

I just want to address some of these responses:
So, first of all, thank you to everyone who wrote suggestions! I appreciate everyone of you! 🤗💕 But it seems I have offended some of you as well.
""We are not a monolith...""
ummm I know that? But as an artist, there actually are particular gifts I would prefer than others—not because I am picky! but because it speaks volumes on how much thought they put into the gift. So, while I do not make being an artist my whole personality, there are art-specific gifts I find more meaningful than others... i love gifting people and whenever I do I always make sure they're catered to what the receiver might find meaningful. I for one, love gifting people customized gifts to make it more personal and whenever I do they love how I put so much thought to it. So, to me, if I was the receiver of the gift, the only thing that would come up to my mind when I get it is that it was so thoughtful of this person to take into consideration the fact that I am an artist... that's the only logic behind the question... So, what's up with all these snarky responses? 
""Get him what he likes, not what he is...""
I am not getting him what he is... why is everybody just jumping into conclusion and assuming this? Y'all acting like I wanna get him a plaque that says ""It's okay to be deaf! 😃"" That's just silly! The reason I do not know what he likes is because I barely interact with him outside of class. We only have a student-teacher relationship as I only interact with him within the classroom. So I have zero clue what he likes or what his hobbies are. I am asking for input from people in this community because you may share the same experiences and thus share the same interests with him and would have some ideas. I could ask him... I mean I could... but see, I never tried to do small talks with him outside the class because I do not want to take up his time or act presumptuous and familiar with him liek we're all buddy-buddy... I don't do that even to hearing professors because I don't ever wanna be seen as a teacher's pet. In fact, this is the first time I am gifting a teacher as I can see he tries his best to teach me even though I'm a bit of a slow-learner compared to the rest of the class. Besides, wouldn't it be cooler if he doesn't expect it and it'll just be a pleasant surprise? But that's it. I don't know why you guys are acting as if I am asking something insulting... Idk how y'all came to the conclusion that I asked this thinking being deaf is his whole personality. But that's just not true... I just want to be thoughtful thinking there might be particular things deaf people would appreciate and find meaningful as a gift... and i don't think that necessarily translates to me thinking ""being deaf is his whole personality."" I just wanna be nice and do something nice, damn. But anyway, to everyone who suggested some ideas, again, thank you so much! 🤟

Flowers. Gift card for food places or stores. Anything you would also give a hearing teacher.

Well, I’m HoH and I would like some nail polish or bath bombs, so I guess all Deaf people would also like nail polish and bath bombs, then. 

/non snarky reply: probably anything you would get a hearing teacher, like a coffee mug, a gift card, cool pens, flowers etc.

What subject does he teach? What are his hobbies? Does he have a family? Where is he from? Maybe a ""world's best teacher"" item?

gift card to a BBQ restaurant?

I’d love to receive some nail polish or a gift card to TJ Maxx!

We’re not a monolith. What would you buy a hearing teacher?

Generic gift cards are always good unless you know the teacher’s favorite places. I always felt bad when I had to regift gift cards to coffee places because I don’t drink coffee. Also, as someone with dietary restrictions, I would recommend against food-based gifts unless you know for sure it’s safe. Not everyone I work with knows I have celiac disease, so they would assume I can eat gluten, and I have to politely decline their food.

Everyone likes gift cards

What does he like? 

Get him what he likes, not what he is...

that’s super thoughtful of you! since it’s more about showing appreciation than going big, i’d lean toward something personal that he can actually keep on his desk or shelf. a custom [bobblehead](https://www.coupleofthings.net?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Reddit_postreply&amp;utm_term=bobblehead&amp;utm_content=reply) of him could be such a fun idea, i’ve made teacher ones before and they always get a laugh but also mean a lot because it feels like “someone noticed me.” you can add little touches like him holding a book or in his classroom vibe. small but really memorable.

What does he like? There must be more to his personality than being deaf.

Honestly? A handwritten letter. We live in a world that isn’t always kind so it’s meaningful when we receive words that are kind

1nt28x6,deaf,Feeling stuck between worlds,"
I don't know. There isn't really anyone I can talk  to about this. Bear with me.

I'm 37 and I don't really have any friends. Only online friends. I'm super introvert and on the nerdy side. Deaf to a deaf parent, went to school for the deaf all my life, always an outsider and bullied by others because I wasn't like the others. Too quiet, too weird. I was the kid who loved reading books. Often I tried ""fitting in"", but it always ended awkward and I hated myself for doing it.

Even today, I don't really fit within the deaf community. I've tried some deaf events and they are too exhausting. And all the gossip about others. Like when I get to meet someone new for the first time, one of the first questions is ""Which school did you go? Oh, do you know A or B?"" It's so annoying. It's also often said deaf people are rather blunt, I'm not that and I don't like it when others are being blunt.

I don't fit within the hearing world either. Hearies are just kind to me and that's just it. I'm unable to build up real connections based on hobbies because of communication barriers. All the events offering for people with same interests are best suited for hearing people. I even tried going to a clean up event, it was fun but the other participants were talking to each other and I had really trouble understanding anyone. I signed up for a monthly art class but sign language interpreters can't be provided by the school, only as an one time thing with at least 3 deaf participants. So I'll see how that goes without interpreters, I'm still interested in the art class.

I worry a lot about the future. I have a job, I'm able to live somewhat comfortably but I feel I'm always gonna be a ghost stuck between worlds, never really seen, always alone. My parents have already passed away and I'm an only child, so I don't even have family to lean on. I don't even know who to call if I need help with anything. My online friends live a country away. 

Sigh. Deep sigh. Had to get this off my chest.",2025-09-28 22:56:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nt28x6/feeling_stuck_between_worlds/
1nszu64,deaf,"Deaf child, HoH adult.","I have literally never communicated with \*anyone\* who I can relate to about this stuff, and this might not be the right place

I had chronic ear infections for the first 5 years of life, when I was 6, I contracted meningitis, and was diagnosed as deaf 1 year later. It sounds unbelievable to say that \*no adults noticed that I was deaf for a YEAR\* but that's really what happened (to say that my parents didn't have their shit together would be an understatement). 

My parents immediately had me get a surgical procedure to restore some of my hearing, then I spent the rest of my childhood getting regular surgeries/tubes implanted in my ears. 

It never once occurred to them to teach me ASL or to talk to anyone in the deaf community about options. Which, considering that we lived in Fremont, CA (huge deaf school/community), is absolutely bonkers to me. Just endless surgeries for me! Wheee! (Sarcasm) 

I learned the ASL alphabet and a lot of words on my own because I love language &amp; the expressiveness of signing. 

I have been HoH forever, but I can read lips okayish and always just got by b/c I didn't want to deal with aides or more procedures when I turned 18 (I'm now 42). My partner and our children are loud AF b/c obviously they have to be. I have friends and coworkers who are incredible and go out of their way to look straight at me, while consistently speaking loudly.   
  
Because the people in my life have been so accommodating, I didn't really think much about my situation until the pandemic, when everyone was wearing masks, and I realized how much I had actually come to rely on reading lips. I suddenly felt like I was on a deserted island or something. I still can't explain it. 

That got me thinking about how non-existent my relationships were with people who could relate to what I was going through, and it felt (still feels) pretty lonely. My parents thought 'we need to fix this' without ever thinking 'we need to find her a support system,' and I was raised with that mentality, to the point where it never even occurred to me to try and build one for myself. 

I'm newish to reddit and am aware that because I am formerly deaf, and only HoH, I am probably not the right person to be in this group. Still, if anyone in here would like to point me in the right direction to build community I would be really grateful. Thanks, all.

1nskpvy,deaf,Vibrating wrist alarm for heavy sleeper?,"First of all I hope I don’t come off as insensitive posting here but I wasn’t sure where else to post with such a specific question.


I need a way to wake myself up that isn’t going to disturb my partner as much as an obnoxiously loud alarm. I am a very heavy sleeper that needs multiple alarms to get myself up, if I only have one I will turn it off while I’m still groggy and go back to sleep and if it’s too quiet I sleep right through them. But on the days when I have to wake up earlier than him it drives him insane having 3 massively loud alarms go off within 15 minutes and he then can’t get back to sleep. When I was sleeping alone I had looked into getting one of those bed shaker alarms, but I read mixed reviews and obviously it won’t work now. I’ve used vibrating wrist alarms previously (Fitbit and random smart watch) but they were so weedy they weren’t waking me up. My phones vibrate can be hit or miss at waking me up, but I think something with some decent power on my wrist could work. I’d be really grateful for a recommendation from a fellow sleeps-like-I’m-dead that might help (bonus if you’re UK!), thank you",2025-09-28 10:14:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nskpvy/vibrating_wrist_alarm_for_heavy_sleeper/
1nsend7,deaf,NAD is in the Toilet,"Hi, r/deaf! Helen here!

I have a deaf audience here that doesn’t use ASL as their primary language and isn’t deeply connected to the big “D” Deaf community. So I’d like to start off with a short and very basic statement on what “NAD” is.

NAD is the “National Association of the Deaf.” It prides itself on being the oldest civil rights organization in our nation. NAD has basically been at the front of civil rights advancements for the deaf since the late 1800s.

Want to learn more about NAD? Internet magic will take you places.

And…

It now seems like NAD is going to collapse.

Yeah. It really does look like NAD is on its knees right now and may actually fall as an organization.

There’s significant buzz in the community surrounding NAD’s board right now.

This buzz around the NAD board has actually been an ongoing thing since the 2024 Super Bowl fiasco. But I’d say it was late this past July when the deaf community finally turned their heads toward NAD and began saying, “Hey, what the fuck is going on with you?” after they pulled that dumb stunt of announcing Kelby Brick as their sole NAD candidate as if they had committed a crime.

Just today, I went ahead and scrolled through r/deaf to see if there’s any talk about this. I got as far back as three weeks and didn’t see anything.

Alrighty, I’m here to fix that.

Let’s begin.

---

#Kelby Brick is the Heir Apparent

---

We all know that Howard Rosenblum left NAD over a year ago.

(Author’s note: Howard is currently running for Congress, FYI. Also, I still have an axe to grind over why he resigned. I’ve thought about writing a post dedicated to that topic for a long time, but I didn’t because it’s kind of old news. But if you’d like to read my thoughts about this, please comment. I’ll make a post covering it if there’s interest.)

Bobbie Beth Scoggins was tapped to take over the reins of NAD as interim CEO not long after Howard’s departure.

Bobbie was NAD’s president for several years at some point in the past two decades. Some people in the community think Bobbie was the last great NAD president. I was a young adult at the time and far more concerned with getting drunk and high than paying attention to NAD, so I don’t really have a strong opinion about Bobbie one way or another. I do, however, remember the drama at the end of her term in 2012, when Chris Wagner and Sheri Farinha were vying for her vacancy.

With Bobbie in the interim CEO role, NAD launched a search committee for the next permanent CEO.

They announced the results of their CEO search process on July 28. You can watch[ it in its full glory here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fpoC_sUpRo).

Okay, let’s get a quick recap out of the way before discussing why this was a big deal.

The quick summary is that Kelby Brick is the sole candidate to be NAD’s next permanent CEO.

He is the current COO of NAD.

Kelby Brick has a law degree and founded Maryland’s Office for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, where he led the office for over 10 years. He left that role to join NAD as their COO.

Look, Kelby Brick is no Howard Rosenblum. But he’s a perfectly fine candidate. A lot of deaf people like him. I think he’s a nice guy, although I’m more familiar with his wife than with him. I have nothing bad to say about him.

The deaf community also has no serious qualms about him becoming the next CEO.

---

#So What’s the Big Deal?

---

The big deal was how NAD’s board announced Kelby Brick’s candidacy.

First of all, an immediate concern was raised about how Kelby Brick is the sole candidate.

Ideally, we’d like to see a few candidates running for the position to allow a real discussion on who we think would be the best choice to run the organization.

When Howard Rosenblum ran for CEO, he was up against Shane Feldman and Darlene Zangara. In a perfect world, that’s what should be happening now in the search for the next CEO.

However, I can let this part slide. We’re living in the most volatile political climate since the 1970s (if not ever). A lot of people are nervous about taking such a public-facing job that inevitably brings intense criticism and pressure.

And it’s also obvious that having only one candidate isn’t the board’s fault. I believe it was mentioned that they had six applicants, and five of them dropped out. Anyone can drop out, and that’s not something we can hold the NAD board liable for.

What set the community abuzz was the weird behavior from president Lisa Rose (and the board to some extent) when she announced Kelby’s candidacy.

At the Zoom meeting on the night of July 27 or 28, Lisa Rose announced they were going to play a pre-recorded video announcing the candidate. She then played the video.

In the video, Kelby Brick was introduced as the candidate. He gave a speech on his candidacy, followed by a Q&amp;A session with several board members asking him questions, which he answered.

When the video ended, Lisa Rose came back on the pinned Zoom screen to thank everyone. She announced that the announcement video would be uploaded on NAD’s Facebook page until midnight that same day, and that a link to a survey would be provided for the community to fill out. The survey also had a midnight deadline.

Then Lisa Rose abruptly ended the Zoom event with zero audience participation.

At the time the meeting concluded, the deaf community had just barely over three hours to watch the video and to fill out the survey.

Lisa Rose and the NAD board acted like they had done something wrong behind the scenes and were covering something up.

If they had simply hosted a meeting, announced that Kelby was the sole candidate, and explained that everyone else backed out except him, I’m confident most people would’ve been fine with it aside from one or two asking why there was only one candidate.

Instead, their actions around the announcement were obviously designed to avoid any interaction with the community.

I mean, seriously, why did they appear so afraid to face the community?

The deaf community reacted to the strange announcement instantly.

The most prominent reactions came from Tar Burt and Chris Haulmark.

The reaction was basically:

“Just one candidate!? What happened to the other five applicants!?”\

“Never mind that. What the hell was that announcement!? No open session with the audience!?”

“This pathetic excuse of a CEO announcement video is only going to be posted on Facebook for THREE HOURS!? And they’re closing the survey in THREE HOURS!?”

“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?”

NAD quickly backtracked. Instead, they posted the announcement video we can still see on their Facebook page today.

#The Newly-Hired CFO’s Salary Is Coming Out of the Interim CEO’s Salary

---

Over the last two weeks, the deaf community has seen a rapid series of events from NAD that seem to point to the organization bleeding to death.

The first was interim CEO Bobbie Beth Scoggins’ [vlog](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1FJutCT8jN/) addressing the community on September 18.

Here’s the summary:

Bobbie said that NAD has faced constant financial issues from the day she joined the organization as CEO. She literally said in her vlog that NAD is hemorrhaging money.

She explained that NAD had already cut a good number of staff before the start of the current fiscal year (April 1) to save money. Despite that, NAD still hasn’t stabilized financially over the last six months.

Then Bobbie announced that NAD hired a CFO on September 1 to help with the organization’s financial instability. But there was a massive caveat.

The only way Bobbie made that possible was by taking a pay cut.

NAD is using Bobbie’s pay cut to cover the CFO’s salary.

Wow.

I mean, Bobbie isn’t the CEO of some massive organization pulling in tens of millions, who can toss away a million or two without blinking just to hire a finance person. I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me, but I’d bet her salary is in the very low six-figure range.

If I’m right, Bobbie’s salary would be completely reasonable for the scope of work she’s doing as CEO of a national organization for the deaf.

And she… and NAD… had to cut her salary just to pay for the CFO’s job?

#Have You Heard About the “Super Flag”?

---

The Super Flag is the largest U.S. flag.

It measures 225 feet high and 505 feet wide, and weighs 3,000 pounds.

It’s recognized by Guinness World Records as the largest U.S. flag.

It’s not on continuous display, but it gets rented out for huge events like the Super Bowl and the World Series. Remember seeing a massive flag covering the entire field on TV? That’s the Super Flag.

It was even once hung vertically over the Hoover Dam. The goddamn thing nearly covered the entire dam.

If Bobbie’s salary cut isn’t a 225 feet high, 505 feet wide, and 3,000 pounds Super Red Flag to you, I don’t know what else to tell you.

---

#NAD is Now Frozen

---

Six days later…

On September 24, NAD released an announcement [vlog](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/177ZfGFqCJ/) by Jacob Leffler on their Facebook page. Jacob is NAD’s Chair of Governance.

I’ll copy/paste the relevant quote from that Facebook post:

&gt;Due to some internal issues, we have made the decision to temporarily pause Board meetings, decision-making within governance, and liaison/representation duties (including the CEO search and filling Board vacancies) until internal mediation and governance training is completed in order to strengthen our alignment with our fiduciary, legal, and ethical responsibilities.

&gt;We have several internal matters that are currently being addressed through the Board’s established internal protocols and are being overseen by an independent subcommittee of the Governance Committee and in accordance with the NAD Bylaws and Board Policy Manual, with fairness and integrity at the forefront of all decisions and actions. Day-to-day NAD staff operations will continue without interruption under the direction of the Interim Chief Executive Officer. NAD remains fully committed to advancing its mission and serving the community.

&gt;Out of respect for this process and to preserve the integrity of NAD’s governance, we ask our community members and outside parties to please respect our process, allow us the time and space to resolve our internal issues, and not to intervene or attempt to influence this internal process.

&gt;Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

This speaks for itself.

NAD, as a national organization, has screeched to a complete halt.

They are now incapable of functioning as a charitable volunteer organization because it appears to be filled with people in high positions who don’t understand the basic functions and responsibilities they carry as representatives of NAD.

It also seems the board is caught in some kind of epic in-fighting.

This right here is a 225 feet high, 505 feet wide, and 3,000-pound Super Red Flag.

#The Community’s Reaction

---

I’m going to list all the vlogs I’ve seen emerge about this scandal.

[Here is an open letter to NAD by Charleen Sculley, President of Nashville’s Chapter of the Tennessee Association of the Deaf.](https://www.facebook.com/scul.char/videos/1216813147133760/?rdid=ahv9rrGnacAcmhr8#)

[The President of Indiana’s Association of the Deaf posted a YouTube video as a Region II state representative to NAD.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7_VNvmDH-A)

[Kim Lucas, former President of the Utah Association of the Deaf, made a YouTube vlog about the chaos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKQ7Au8iH9M)

There’s a guy on Facebook who made a couple of posts about NAD’s lack of transparency and called for Lisa Rose’s resignation. I can’t link his Facebook here for some reason, but you can find him by searching Christopher Merritt Patterson on Facebook.

All of these reactions were posted over the last few days.

---

#Chris Haulmark

---

Chris is the one who has been posting about the NAD board’s poor conduct over the past year.

Look up his name on Facebook to see all of his vlogs.

Chris has 11 vlogs on this topic going back to January of this year.

All of his vlogs are really long, with some reaching an hour in length.

If there is any one deaf person in the community addicted to smelling their own fart, it is Chris Haulmark.

His vlogs covering NAD’s incompetence are overly pedantic. He focuses way too much on the strict language of the organization’s bylaws and doesn’t really communicate the obvious, in-your-face incompetence of NAD’s board very well. He also often makes incorrect interpretations of the bylaws language.

Chris is completely obsessed with the term “ultra vires.”

“Ultra vires” is a Latin term that literally means “beyond the powers.” In law, it refers to actions taken by an individual or organization that go beyond the scope of authority granted to them.

Chris is not wrong to describe NAD in this way, but he comes across as someone who discovered this term and overuse it to make himself appear smart.

Okay, Helen, you’re done with your Chris Haulmark rant now. Calm down. Move on.

But there is one thing Chris absolutely nails about the board’s conduct.

They are wrong for conducting so many of NAD’s mission and strategy decisions behind closed doors.

NAD is a non-profit charitable organization. They are required to be completely transparent with what they are doing for the community.

And they are not.

This is what Chris is correct about.

---

#In Conclusion…

---

I have so many things to say about how deeply frustrated I am with the widespread misunderstanding within the deaf community about how a non-profit charitable organization should be run.

I’m particularly frustrated with the habit of people acting like serving on a non-profit is the same as serving on a secret cabal that should operate out of public view.

Anyone who thinks this way is a fucking idiot.

Everything a non-profit charitable organization does needs to be public knowledge.

But my post is already long enough. I’m also mentally and physically tired from writing this whole thing, so I’ll share my true thoughts on this in another post.

For now, I’d like to close by asking you to comment with your thoughts on this current scandal/chaos.

Love,

1nsa1kt,deaf,Dating as a C.I. user is very hard sometimes,"Hey all, just wanted to rant and get some thoughts out about dating as someone who is profoundly deaf but uses a cochlear implant.

I am really grateful that I got implanted at age two after meningitis, but honestly there are still so many challenges that come with being a C.I. user.

Noisy group settings are a nightmare. Meeting new people is tough because I basically have to “download” their voice before I can really follow them. And of course there are the dead batteries that always seem to happen at the worst possible times.

I know guys in general miss hints when women are flirting, but for me it is on another level. Half the time I just do not hear them, so they assume I am rude or cold for ignoring them when really I am just lost in the audio.

The worst was at a friend’s work party. I was actually hitting it off with this woman, and we stepped outside to talk one on one. Then, for the first time in twenty years, my C.I. glitched. My own words were delayed by about three seconds in my head, like full-on audio lag. It completely killed the vibe. She got confused and eventually just said we should go back inside. Brutal, soul crushing and awkward as fuck.

I hate this so much. Dating is already hard enough, but being deaf adds a whole extra layer. Anyone else out there deal with this? How do you navigate dating while deaf or hard of hearing?

Just wanted to add that I don’t mean to sound super selfish having a C.I. and complain when there are deaf individuals who remain deaf and use sign language. I respect y’all and hope not to offend anybody!! ",2025-09-27 23:55:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nsa1kt/dating_as_a_ci_user_is_very_hard_sometimes/

This really isn't the best place to ask this kind of thing.  This is a global community and even then not all of us are lucky enough to have learned the Sign Language of our region or country.  Try facebook or deaf centered groups in your area.

Arizona has a HUGE and vibrant Deaf community from what I've been told, If you want a tutor, open your wallet and you're sure to find one. Maybe you can find a CODA that can tutor/practice for as little a a few cups of coffee.

From your post I can't tell if you're aware or understand why you're being pushed away until you're intermediate.  You have to consider why Deaf people are going to these meetups. Would you want to tutor someone in English for free when you're at one of the only accessible social outlets for yourself?

Also and most importantly be aware that members of the Deaf club/community near you aren't trying to gatekeep or anything like that. They just need to draw a line somewhere. A lot of us have to fight and work very hard to access to ASL or whichever sign language for our country. Many of us are not fortunate enough to learn it until we're adults.  When a hearing person asks to join in and ""practice"" it's really like a stab to the gut.

You may have more luck with r/ASL or a Facebook group for ASL beginners practice. I've found Lingvano and lifeprint.com good for vocabulary, and I take class at my local school for the deaf and HoH. Don't worry, once you get conversational you can jump into a lot more spaces.",2025-09-26 22:21:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nreqsi/looking_to_make_friends_and_language_practice/
1nraof7,deaf,Hearing aids being detrimental?,"My son, 1.5, has 7% and 0% conversational hearing in his right and left ears respectively. I’ve noticed he has started to pull/take out his left hearing aid (his worse ear) and wonder, could it possibly be causing feedback that only hinders what he picks up in his right ear? Our audiologist mentioned this may be something that could happen.. that the hearing aid for his more profoundly deaf ear could possibly be “useless” (for lack of a better word). He is young and also has other disabilities so he can’t communicate to us just yet about the HAs

I worry it’s bothering him, but he is a toddler and might just be playing with it? 

Is this something other Deaf people or parents of Deaf children have experienced and would you suggest possibly leaving his left hearing aid off? We see our audiologist again in 2 weeks and I plan to speak about this to her, but would like opinions from this community in the mean time.

Thank you 

[댓글]
Did they test his conversational hearing with the aids on? Do you have a cause of his deafness? 

Also, you can get a bonnet that will help him not pull his aids out, and definitely start some basic signs and/or a communication tablet if he can’t sign back. Even if you think he’s not picking up on the signs, he might surprise you. 

If you’re not already enrolled in your state’s EI program, definitely look into it.  Also, r/podc (parents of deaf children) might be useful.

Are YOU hearing feedback coming from the HAs?  If you are, know that it’s a ton louder in our own ears, &amp; despite what some people may dismiss, it’s extremely annoying, covers up everything, &amp; may even be painful.  Ask your audiologist to lower the volume to 85% &amp; see how f that helps…  if it does, then they were too loud, too soon.

Personally, I'm an adult, but my hearing loss was close to that when I decided to move to CI. I was 6% and 9%. Functionally, my hearing aids did basically nothing. I could hear if a car honked at me. There wasn't really much of a point in wearing them. 

I had a good experience with my CI though, and pretty much were them 24/7 outside of sleeping and showering. 

If he is at 0%/7%, that's gonna be in the same ballpark.

I couldn’t speak till I was nearly five but could remember the pain of my ear moulds and crying that I was still forced to wear them because the audiologist insisted. The pain was so severe that to this day, I’m still reluctant to wear aids on my left ear even though they don’t hurt.",2025-09-26 19:33:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nraof7/hearing_aids_being_detrimental/

about sa future career or job ko and can't help to worry that it will really affect me. Honestly I don't talk about this with anyone except my family syempre. Not even my close or long time friends know, though maybe they've noticed.

You’re gonna have to advocate for yourself and tell them you’re half deaf/hard of hearing

Based on your mid sentence switch from English to Filipino, I'm going to guess that you live in the Philippines. The stigma and discrimination against people that have hearing loss or other disabilities is a little worse there than in say the USA, or the UK, (from what I've read) but it's within your ability to overcome.


&gt;though maybe they've noticed


They have, people have noticed that you're ""different"" but not all of them will think you have a hearing problem, body of them will assume something is wrong with your brain. They'll assume you're stupid, or something. 


First you need to see a doctor and see if there's anything you can do about your hearing loss. Not every case will get good results from hearing aids, but you should explore that sooner than later.


You're in college so this is a print time to find others like you, near you. Life the other comments are saying, you need to learn to self advocate. You need to be be comfortable being yourself. Peer support is a good way to build that.

Can you get hearing aids? What field are you thinking of going into?

I suffered discrimination in school for being openly Deaf, that's for sure. But tell yourself that if they attack you for being hard of hearing while you openly state that you are, they definitely have a higher chance to get reprimanded for ableism

In the Same situation but my father ignore and abuse me for being in this condition:) have you tried any hearing device?

Ah that sucks. 

You need to be strong. Get a hearing test, and if possible, hearing aids to help.

Talk about your hearing loss with friends and family, without shame. Be an advocate for the community. You're young and have a long life ahead of you. What most people regret in old age is living a life around other peoples expectations/assumptions - don't do this. Carve your own path and be strong. There is nothing to be insecure about.

I’m 32 and have struggled with worsening hearing since 2021. Neither family nor friends, let alone professionals have the ability to understand the emotional and physical pain I’m in. Any kind of noise hurts my ears and every time my ears get hurt I lose more hearing. I hear no low/mid dBs and only a thin range of high in my right.",2025-09-26 17:43:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nr7v9o/half_deaf/

I was never taught sign growing up and now I'm really struggling to find a way to learn. Every program I see is targeted at hearing individuals learning sign and/or cost a lot of money. Is there a way to get like free sign language tutoring or classes as someone who is deaf/hoh?

[댓글]
I'm in a similar situation. I'm taking classes from my local community college. But if you find something, let me know. Because I've looked online to see about resources.But i've not really seen anything for late Deaf

Check to see if there is a local Deaf advocacy organization near you.

I am 61 years old.  When my partner and I got together, I picked up sign and started taking it seriously (had a little history with it).  Now I'm conversationally comfortable.  You can learn new languages even when older.  Find a good school, find a good practice partner / meetup / group - throw yourself into it.  It's intensely rewarding.

Local community colleges sometimes have affordable classes. If you are in Maryland, those classes are free or cheap.

Get in contact with your local DHS/workforce and rehabilitation office, they typically know community leaders and have classes to help orient yourself, however deaf schools are usually the better pick. 

It may seem odd to call a school as an adult but they’re pillars of our community and are meant to provide resources and education, I’m certain they’ll be happy to atleast point you in the right direction if they don’t have public classes ☻

Find a way to prioritize learning. Learning to sign is hard, even with good courses, so I think you should try to find a way. Taking a year off and studying full time? 

You will learn most by interacting with Deaf and other native signers. That’s basically free. It’s not that easy to get to that point, though. You need some foundations to have a chance being taken seriously.

They should have books on ASL at your local library check those out .

Lots of free online stuff, but it depends on where you are and what sign language is used locally.

Are you in Canada or the US ? If in Canada look up silent voice or Bob rumball foundation both have resources and may be able to connect you or Canadian hearing services as well. Best of luck on your ASL journey

Some of these resources are for children but it’s the best list I have found for [deaf resources](https://deafchildren.org/knowledge-center/resources/asl-resources-deaf-children-2/). You might need to provide an audiogram to have access to free classes just click on the state you live in. 

Also Facebook has been a really helpful resource I have found free community classes and my local deaf community that way.

I work with many deaf. 

Tutor hearing ASL student, but mentor deaf student or deaf people not student.

I do not like deaf go class ASL. 

Suggest late deaf find mentor help teach ASL and learn Internet also.

I am in a similar situation- the cheapest way to learn I’ve found is lessons.com I found a single language interpreter on there who was willing to give lessons for $45 each and a discount if you paid in advance. 
It was really helpful

In my ASL class, there is no one talking. Of course, I understand that it is probably still with a hearing person perspective (and sadly some misconceptions and privilege can be found) but I would think in classes like this a Deaf person could learn. Have you checked your local college ? I’m not Deaf, so take my comment with a grain of salt. 


There is also online resources. Gallaudet does online asl classes and it can’t get better like this. 

In addition, asl inside is very cheap.

https://www.aslinside.com

Many YT videos out there and taking a class at a community college may be a less costly option.

My wife and I talked with our local public school district who connected us with deaf and hearing people, parents and families.  Although it’s best to learn from a deaf person first but family can be just as helpful because they can help bridge the language gap.

I’m in the same boat. A Deaf friend recommended this app to me:

Lingvano - https://apps.apple.com/app/id1547252782

I haven’t started using it yet but it’s not terribly expensive (there’s a deal this weekend for $70ish for a year or you can do monthly). Could be a great way to get started. Good luck!

The library might have books on it. Also YouTube might have some help.

I just looked it up on YouTube and there's a bunch of classes on ASL",2025-09-26 13:51:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nr1wef/learning_sign_as_an_adult/
1nqbk8j,deaf,Is it rude to approach a deaf person in public to have a conversation in sign language?,"I am hearing but have been learning ASL for a few years, my opportunities to practice are limited. I was wondering if it would be rude if I saw people signing, for example, while in line at a coffee shop, for me to approach them and say hello, ask how their day is, etc. On one hand, feels OK because I would def start small talk with people in English, just waiting in line and stuff like that. On the other hand, feels weird because I probably would not start small talk in a language I'm not comfortable with and I don't know if the person might think I am ""using"" them or trying to make them teach me something, which is not my intent. Just hoping to be friendly and get some practice.

  
TL;DR: Can I start a conversation in ASL to practice as a hearing person whose ASL is not super good?

[댓글]
If you know someone signs - like they were chatting ahead of you in line - you could say hi and make small-talk.  But do it in the same way you would with a stranger in line who also speaks English.  Would you interject into a couple's quiet conversation?  Of course not.  Are they having a ""big signs"" demonstrative conversation that all but begs for someone to go ""Oh, I know!  The service is so slow today!  How long have you been waiting?"" or whatever, then sure.

Ick. It totally can be rude. If you keep it to a breezy “Hey! I’m learning sign and was so excited to see it! Just saying hi and hope you have a good day!” it’d be fine. But if you wanted to recite the alphabet, you’re better off just…not. Please don’t. 

I say keep it breezy and light and move on because you need to respect that the Deafies have plans and most likely won’t be able to stick around and have a lengthy conversation with you, regardless of topic. If they do keep you, then let that be a delightful surprise. Otherwise, keep it moving and be happy you met a native signer outside of the classroom. 

As others have noted, check the signing speed and body language first before approaching. If they look anything other than relaxed and chill, leave ‘em alone.

I understand where you're coming come. It seems like a nice thing to make conversation and practice your ASL. But you have to see it from the other side of things. I have a service dog and I can't tell you how many times I've been interrupted in public by people asking about the service dog. And at first, I was excited to talk about it, I want to, I hope that people donate to the organization that trained her. But then when you have a few days where it ends up taking 40 minutes of your time which you really didn't have because you have to do groceries,get the kids to their lessons, and get to work on time, you start to get a bit annoyed. So if someone came up to me on a day where I had nothing else to do,fine it's okay to chat, but if you come up to me on a day where it's extremely busy I don't want to chat. But the thing is the person coming up to me doesn't know what kind of day I'm having. 
Also I have back issues and it's happened to me so many times where someone noticed my hearing aids and then start to tell me all about their partner/spouse who should have hearing aids but won't get them. 45 minutes later I'm still in the parking lot, my back is killing me, they're unloading their whole life story and I'm stuck listening cuz I don't want to be rude. 
For a while I was keeping track and it was averaging about 3 hours a week basically being up interrupted by people in public. So I learned to move with purpose, keep my eyes down, be a little bit short with people, just so that I can do the stuff that I need to do in my life cuz I'm a busy person too. 
So my advice is to read the room a little bit before you try and be considerate if the person isn't that interested that day.

Strangers conversing in their native language aren't in public to be ""practice"" for you. 

Look for Deaf events in your area, coffee chats etc.

My opinion, depend how much ASL you know.

Would you approach any random hearing people and say “I know English!”

I always wonder this when I see people signing. Thanks for asking, OP. My takeaway is I won’t introduce myself to signing strangers unless it’s a socially acceptable scenario.

I think the important distinction from OPs post is ""see people Signing"" e.g. they are going up to people already engaged in conversation with each other. ""Small talk with people in line"" doesn't usually involve interrupting an ongoing conversation to ask how somebody's day is going.

I really dislike when people do this. You don't know what that person has going on at that moment. I wouldn't unless you know the people personally.

Even if you're a deaf person, it still is rude.

I think it’s weird. It would be like someone coming up to you and saying “I know English.” I would look around for social events (a library, a church, the local Deaf school if you have one near by) those times would be ok to start a conversation

It really depends. Everyone is different, and people who generally don’t mind might be in a bad mood or a hurry one day. [My personal opinion](https://slacowan.com/2024/07/23/should-you-introduce-yourself-to-a-deaf-stranger-in-public-my-reply-is-no/) is that I generally dislike when learners use me as practice. 

It would be better if you maybe looked into local deaf events, like Deaf Nights Out (there are usually local Facebook groups or pages) where you can practice with a variety of signers rather than relying on the hope of organically running into a deaf stranger.

I read a lot in online Deaf communities that people don’t mind and want it. But my in person experience is the opposite. Everyone is different. Personally I hate it, I feel like a zoo animal you’re doing your ASL labs on. I just want to live my life with my own language like hearing people get to do.

I have been Deaf and Deafblind my whole life. A Deaf person approached me to ask if I am deaf and know sign language. I said yes, I am Deaf and know ASL, with a smile. I don't think it's rude to ask questions. A pharmacist, a hearing CODA, knew I was Deaf since I said I couldn't hear and asked to write with a pen. A hearing CODA said, ""I know ASL and am happy to help you."" It made me smile and happy to communicate. I am Deafblind. Hearing people who don't know sign language ask me if I can lipread. My response to hearing people is, 'Can you read my hands?' I think it's rude for hearing people to ask Deafblind people if they can lipread. Most Deafblind people with some sight cannot lipread.

I don't know sign language, but I've had people come up to me signing, assuming that I do.  I'm not offended by that at all.  On the other hand, I've had deaf people get offended by the fact that I don't know how to sign, which I thought was hilarious.  That's just me though.  I've been bullied a lot growing up, being the only deaf person in the class.  I've grown to have thick skin.  It's not a hill worth dying on for me, nor am I that easily triggered.  Perhaps I'm not your average deaf person-

I find it incredibly rude. Years ago, I met up with a Deaf girlfriend at the mall, and a mall walker who was learning ASL kept pestering us. Lap after lap, she approached us to practice her ASL. I've had other people approach me, but nothing that stalkerish.

no, its cringe

Nahhh we would be surprised and happy with extra chatter  , important is watch what they said if all good go fornit if they argue walk away !!! 🤣🤣

i dont think it’s any more rude than someone learning english coming up to you because they hear you speak it and wanna practice. i guess you’d feel it’s a bit weird but be polite, that’s how i would respond at least. but i’m not a native english speaker myself and most of what i know is from chatting with people online, so i know it makes a huge difference to be able to do that. but in your case i guess it’s better to make friends who sign or wanna learn because i don’t know how much a minute of random small talk will help haha

For me not rude but awkward. You probably wouldn’t go up to someone who was speaking Spanish if you were learning Spanish or any other spoken language. Same applies to ASL for me. And in my experience the ASL is usually the just demonstrating fingerspelling.

I never mind practicing with hearing people. I agree with others, though -- try to vibe check the conversation location and vibe! An arguing couple maybe isn't the place to say ""hey"" haha! 

One of my only icks is hearing people trying to chat with me, then getting frustrated when they can't understand and quickly switching to English or walking away from me without saying bye? Not assuming you'd do this.... just want to mention I think it's pretty widely considered rude and should be avoided.

I handle it differently.  I use an app and practice ASL.  It's amazing how many people who approach me to correct my signing and offer support.

No, practice your asl with the people who explicitly want to help you. However, there are little ways to practice. Compliment or greeting and go on with your day, like you do with strangers.

Not all deaf people know sign language. I list my hearing at 33 and don't know ASL.

Generally, it wouldn't be rude at all. It shows your willingness to learn and share our language.

Just take a look first before you approach though. Do they look like they're very occupied with something that might be work or looking unpleasant? I wouldn't approach and let them be. Other than that, give them a little hello and see if they're interested from there. You got this.

Not rude at all, I love it when people do this! Obviously be sensible about it (ie don't approach someone who's clearly upset/in a hurry/having a private conversation etc) but otherwise yes please do 😁

If you have enough ASL skills to make small talk and you notice me signing and you want to stop me to have a short conversation, I’m open. If you want me to teach you ASL on the spot, I wouldn’t have time for that lol",2025-09-25 16:34:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nqbk8j/is_it_rude_to_approach_a_deaf_person_in_public_to/

If you're learning ASL go to your local Deaf Night Out. Don't be friends with someone just because they're Deaf but bc you have similar interests and like them like any other friend. ♡♡♡

You can always post on Reddit or social media or wherever you interact with the world that you're looking for someone willing to practice ASL with you.  It might not be a Deaf person that responds, but chances are it'll be someone who is involved in the community, and you're better off stepping towards/into the community and making friends that way than trying to zero in on a Deaf friend specifically for their Deafness.  It's still ""token Deaf friend"" even if it's not at all malicious, which I don't think you're trying to be!

Would you be okay with somebody wanting to be your friend because you had a certain hair color or trait? 


Do you wanna be their friend just because they're deaf? 

That shouldn't be the only thing that makes a friendship that kind of comes off as fetishism. 

I don't wanna assume.  I would hope that you'd want to be somebody's friend because you have stuff in common. Not based on their auditory status. 

If you actually want to get to know people, you could go to Deaf events and maybe even take an asl class.

Go pay/donate and learn ASL from classes at a local Deaf cultural center or a Deaf school. Also if you get good enough at signing, you can help at a Deaf school as a TA, and assist the community on their terms. You could really get into the community too if you become an ASL interpreter, but that's a lot of work...Good luck! 🤗

1npjzds,deaf,Is my coworker wearing hearing aids?,"I recently saw my coworker wear hearing aids or cochlear implants. He's 30. It is so small but noticeable. There is this wire that goes in his ear canal wheres there is a small device, and the wire connects to something behind his ear. Is this a hearing aid or cochlear implant? I never saw him wear it before. I remember he used to wear earphones in his ears. Does he have severe hearing loss? 

[댓글]
Why don't you just ask him?

I mean this in the nicest way possible: just ask him. It may open up to conversation about accessibility in the workplace or not.

Your description of whatever is around his ear doesn’t make sense to me… I, personally, have never heard of a wire actually going into the ear — a tube, yes. But not an actual wire.

I’m curious what this device might be. Have you googled pictures of cochlear implants, hearing aides (in the ear, behind the ear… there are different kinds), and more recently BAHA (bone conducting hearing aides)?

Make sure your saying deaf not death when asking

It's a hearing aid :) if you're curious about it just ask him

Sounds like a hearing aid. No way to know the extent of his hearing loss unless you ask. I have had the same hearing aids as my loss progressed from moderate to severe.

It's digital hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss as a hard of hearing. Why can't you ask him and go to Google Images instead of asking here on Reddit?

Just ask him. 
Chances are, he will tell you. 

My friend asked me the other day about mine. I wasn't offended. 
Now your friend could have a different answer. But you won't know unless you ask him.

Most likely a regular hearing aid. Cochlear implants have a very different look than that. My aunt wears the same style (hers are from audien) and they look identical to what you described. You really can't tell how ""severe"" someone's hearing loss is just by the device though. Maybe you should just ask him directly.

Just ask him, I use HA's and lip read and hate it when people skate around the subject

Idk lmao ask him

It's probably a hearing aid. Whether he cares if people ask, well that depends on him. I don't really mind though I have gotten stuff like ""you talk well for a hearing impaired person"" and one lady tried to take one out of my ear asking what it was, which was wild! She was drunk but it was so out of pocket!

1npcmtn,deaf,Do deaf people need earplugs for gigs.,"I’m going to a gig tonight, and I’m unsure if I need to wear earplugs? As someone who is profoundly deaf, with tinnitus, is there a point where they become basically pointless, and only get in the way of what little I have to work with?

(I know I’m not going to get an answer for myself, but for some reason this information was really hard for me to get hold of (Google could not be made to understand I was deaf), and the little there was seemed to be for people with more to lose and tinnitus to gain. But hopefully this helps the me’s of the future. I’m going to try plugs, and report back what happens later in an edit or something.)

Edit update: Got earplugs from the vendor and wore them for the show. It didn’t really seem to impact how well I could hear the music, but that might be because I mostly hear through vibrations anyway! Thanks for all the advice, hopefully other people with my question can find an answer here!

[댓글]
NAA but I think if you have earplugs available it couldn't hurt. If anything, it may prevent the tinnitus from getting worse?

Also profoundly deaf. 

Depends on how close I am to the source of the noise. I’ve been in the pit/close the stage and got some relief from the barrage against my eardrums with earplugs. But I usually get a seat instead of standing room if I can help it, which is farther away and don’t need earplugs. 

It’s probably going to be a personal preference thing mostly. But the general rule is if it’s loud enough that hearing people are in pain/using protection, then deaf people need to use protection too just to prevent structural damage, even if we have “nothing to lose”.

it depends on the nature of your hearing loss.  If I were going to such an event I would absolutely wear earplugs. My hearing loss is entirely in the cochlea so my ear drum and ossicular chain are just like a hearing person's, as far as I can tell. Exposure to loud noise can be awful. 

Also consider that you have tinnitus, you need to protect your ears as much as you can. More damage to your ears could potentially make your tinnitus worse.

I have severe and profound deafness. My audiologist encourages me to still wear earplugs to protect what remains

*Extremely* loud noises can damage the vestibular system (balance).  And as another user said it might make tinnitus worse.

By the way hearing aids are not earplugs.  They tend to block high frequency more than low frequency.  I hear low frequency well and it often surprises me what I can hear bass-wise through my hearing aid earpiece when it's on mute.  I'd guess they only cut maybe 10 dB down there.

Everyone are different for me all i do is take my hearing aids out and i am good for it !!! Other need to plug die whatever their issues is.

I don’t have an answer other than an opinion. Just because parts of the ear doesn’t work as originally designed doesn’t mean that it can’t be injured so I would wear the ear plugs just so I don’t injure myself in a way that would end up hurting me but not be noticable until it hurts.

I guess it depends on if you rely on what hearing you have left? and also if you use any hearing devices and what they are. like as a ci user i wouldn't wear earplugs to a concert because there'd be no point, i hear through an entirely different system separate from what could be damaged from exposure to loud noises, but if i still had hearing aids i'd wear them as earplugs

Yeah, all those born deaf, hard of hearing, and late-deafened experience tinnitus. They wear hearing aids to help mask tinnitus. Most Deaf people don't care for tinnitus since they never wear hearing aids. Tinnitus doesn't have a cure, but wearing hearing devices helps mask it because of the brain's craving for sound. 

For me, I've had tinnitus for a long time since I was born profoundly Deaf. I grew up with hearing aids. I removed them and noticed I could hear without them. I learned about tinnitus before my CIs. I wear processors to mask tinnitus. I don't have 24/7 tinnitus. When I remove the processors, my tinnitus appears in my ears from brain cravings for sound. 

If I'm stressed or eat the wrong foods or drink too much caffeine, it can trigger tinnitus. So I have to cut down on caffeine and avoid artificial, high-sodium, and sugary ingredients. I can do yoga to take a deep breath and relax. I tried various foam earplugs, but they're uncomfortable for my ears. I ordered WeatherX earplugs on Amazon to be comfortable for my ears.

I wear earplugs to preserver the hearing that I have.

Please wear ear plugs I hurt my ears with broken walkie talkie and ever since then any slightly loud noise destroys more hearing and hurts my ears. Every single day I have pain. Please always wear earplugs.

Hearings aids out, earplugs in. It doesn’t help that the interpreter area is usually right in front of a bunch of speakers.

Contrary to what Marky Mark has said, vibrations are actually bad and affect more than just hearing.

Ironically the only time I ever felt my eardrums hurting from a show was by a small local punk band called the Deaf Dogs. That was the first time I really understood how someone could lose their hearing from loud noise!

To answer your question: depends how close you are to the band/speakers and how sensitive your ear drums/tinnitus is to repeated loud noises. It wouldn’t hurt to have them just in case even if you don’t wear them, in case you make it to the venue and discover you actually do need them, then it’s good to keep that option open.

Yes completely yes to wearing earplugs 


You wear earplugs because specifically you want to avoid further damage, because you cannot sense it!


It's like asking whether a person who can't feel in their fingers need to wear oven mitts when taking hot pans out of the oven. They cannot sense the temperature of the pan, but obviously the pan is still hot.


The sound level is the same at a concert whether you are deaf/hearing impaired or not. The earplugs protect you from physical damage the same way a pair of oven mitts protect you from hot pan in an oven.

From what my audiologist said, if you wear hearing aids, keep them in- it’s safer than taking them out because of some technology. Otherwise, though, not sure.",2025-09-24 13:48:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1npcmtn/do_deaf_people_need_earplugs_for_gigs/

1nosmxv,deaf,ASL interpreter,"I have been hard of hearing since I was young. I was raised completely mainstream and lip reading (I am very good at it if I do say so myself). As a young adult I started learning sign language and in college I continued to take classes and became fluent and loved using it. Once I graduated and moved away from that bubble I found myself going back to just coping. I got a job, a girlfriend, and I play a few adult sports (think pickle ball and flag football). At this point me knowing sign language is more of a party trick. 

I had a conversation with my girlfriend and she has started learning asl for me. I am going to a concert soon (I never go since I hate people and crowds) is it appropriate for me to request an interpreter so that I don’t miss any info? On that same note moving forward could I request an interpreter for doctor’s appointments, and other important functions? ASL is so much easier for me than lip reading. I guess I feel like I’m not deaf enough to have these accommodations.

[Here](https://www.ada.gov/resources/effective-communication/) are the ADA provisions for ""Effective Communication.""  Notice that they state they are, ""For people who are deaf, have hearing loss, or are deaf-blind...""  Nowhere do they prescribe a certain decibel of hearing loss, or even a certain level of fluency in ASL.

You are deaf enough.

Go for it. Request the interpreter. There could be valuable information being missed.

Oh of course you have a right to request ASL services anywhere regardless of your ASL skills. I used ASL interpreters when I was learning ASL myself as I grew up oral.

Def request one! I was born Deaf and raised with ASL as my 1st language but I think any level of DHH should use one if they want. My mom is hearing and has been an educational interpreter before I was born. Most of her clients and students aren't fluent in ASL. She uses a lot of different levels of Pidgin or even SE that matches the level of her client or student best all the time and is happy to do it. She says her job is to help all DHH have accessibility ASL fluency or profoundly Deaf is not a requirement. Just let the terp know what youre most comfortable with before hand and that way you grt the most out of them being there. Ive never met a terp who isnt happy to do that. :-) ♡

You can request an interpreter if you need one. As you mentioned in your post you prefer to have an ASL interpreter instead of relying on lip reading. Just because you are labeled or identify as hard of hearing doesn’t mean you can request one. They are not strictly for a certain level of loss/ dB or for the Deaf. If you have hearing loss and communicate via ASL you can request one.

I would recommend experiencing interpreted services at least once in your lifetime. Take adv, if you can.

Many fully hearing people have sign language as their mother language or first language, and many are more comfortable in signing than in spoken language. 

Arguably they also have a right under national legislation - especially if the national sign language is a recognised language of the country - to request a sign language interpreter for health appointments.  

They would also have a right to attend sign-led schools as children.  Which would be to the benefit of the deaf students becasue CODAs, especially CODAs who **want** to attend a signing school, arrive at the school already fluently signing unlike many deaf students from non-signing hearing families.

Absolutely!!! You have every right to an ASL interpreter for concerts, doctors appointments and others thanks to the ADA.

I’ll warn you… you will get push back about them securing interpreters but it’s still your ADA right so you need to be persistent in having an interpreter.",2025-09-23 20:35:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nosmxv/asl_interpreter/
1norq4z,deaf,Vacation Recommendations,"I had hearing for most of my life.  Now I'm HoH on the left and deaf on the right.  I have left hearing aid and CI on the right.  

This question is for my sanity.  What vacation spots or activities would you recommend for someone that wants to take off his ears for a weekend getaway?  I would go by myself and wouldn't necessarily communicate verbally for the rest if the weekend.  Any suggestions?  

I could go hiking, sitting and reading, but what other vacation spots or activities would you recommend?

[댓글]
What area/country? What kind of things do you like to do? Do you know sign language?

My HoH friend and I enjoy historical sites, taking the train with a dining cart, museums of art or history, the zoo, the aquarium the fair, amusement parks, trampoline parks, fishing, hiking, and climbing. A lot of areas have those signs all over that you can read. The historical railroad where I live has an ASL interpreter who works there and they sometimes have WWII tanks and cool stuff. 

Idk if you like pure nature, zoos, trains, art, history, or night life or what. 

Oh, and I love petting the zoo! Especially the ones where you drive through and there are llamas and buffalo and deer and stuff.

I'm not very social, but they do have ASL events if you know sign. If you don't, sometimes the local deaf school will hold them for cheap and it's a way to enjoy other people if you're social, you may even make new friends. Sometimes I'll go to a drag show, you don't have to be gay or hear what's going on in my opinion, I just enjoy the atmosphere. We went to a baseball game, similar to the drag show, we didn't know what they were saying but a lot is visual and I mostly go for the vibes and food and fireworks. Or sometimes I'll go to the big city and just walk around eat and buy things. You could play slot machines at a casino if you know you aren't going to blow all your money! I only put 50 in and that's it. 

Do you want a vacation in the city? In the country surrounded by farms? On the beach?

I'm in Hawai'i. I enjoy taking the ears off and going hiking.

Anywhere u wanna dream go to vacation make no difference

You can go anywhere with your hearing aids off. ;).  You’ll get used to it once you get some practice in.  Always have paper and pen.  Thar said the zoo is a fantastic idea, low effort for socialization and you can just chill.

There are tons of friendly places u can look ups or go to travel agencies they cN help u find

An all-inclusive beach resort? A cruise? A cabin or AirBnB in the woods or mountains? Preferably a place where you could check in/out and order food from an app?

1nofqds,deaf,Advice on which language I should learn,"Dear everyone, I am not quite sure whether this is the right subreddit, but I would value your opinion on my question and would like to get a broad perspective. I (f18) am currently looking into which sign language I should learn, I would like to learn one to be able to communicate with deaf individuals in the future and I am interested in broadening my languages. I am located in northwestern Europe and am unsure if which language to choose. I would like to be able to use it across Europe, but I am unsure if there is even one like that. Honestly I am quite lost and I am just really unsure which I should learn. In my future I would probably work in northern Western Europe; England, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, etc. I am interested in your perspective which language would be best for me to learn! Thanks in advance🌸

[댓글]
I took a peek at your post history and if you plan to stay in the Netherlands, you should probably learn Nederlandse Gebarentaal (NGT) or Dutch Sign as your regional sign language. It's in the same language family as French, Italian, Belgian and Austrian sign, so if you wanted to learn those in the future or just focus on International Sign after, that could work. 


If you live close to the German border, Deutsche Gebärdensprache (DGS) or German Sign could also be an option. It doesn't overlap with as many, mainly Polish and Israeli sign.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

&gt;northwestern Europe

Which country?

&gt; In my future I would probably work in northern Western Europe; England, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, etc.

Learn the SL of your own country first, then other SLs of the countries you want to engage with and/or International Sign.

""would probably"" is not good enough to make a selection. ""will"" as in ""I have an active plan and am committed to doing so"" is better, and ""will definitely"" as in ""I am already in the process of moving, it is only a matter of time before I board the plane"" is good reasoning.

Your life could go in so many different directions, especially once you learn sign. You don't want to decide to learn ASL then never encounter an ASL signer in real life, and everyone you do meet cannot understand anything you sign.

&gt;I would like to be able to use it across Europe, but I am unsure if there is even one like that.

[International Sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Sign) (IS) is a pidgin language used between signers who sign different sign languages. It is quite popular in Europe.

Here is a news and education channel that puts out IS content: [H3 WORLD TV - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@H3WORLDTV)

However I **strongly** advise you **not** to learn IS as your first sign language. It requires a base level of signing skill to learn - as it uses quite advanced features of sign languages that beginners struggle quite a lot with.

As I stated above, learn the sign language of your own country first, and then IS or the SLs of the countries you wish to have a connection with.

&gt;I would like to learn one to be able to communicate with deaf individuals in the future and I am interested in broadening my languages.

Then the individuals you wish to interact with are those in your own community, in your own country, not hypothetical people you may never meet.

People sometimes decide ""\[*the sign language of my country*\] is boring / not big enough / not aesthetically pleasing, I want to go and learn \[*other sign language*\] because it is better"" - and this comes off so so so patronising and snobbish. It treats sign language like an accessory, rather than a language of a community - one you can become a part of in your own way. Don't be one of those people.",2025-09-23 12:14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nofqds/advice_on_which_language_i_should_learn/
1noe94l,deaf,AI in the deaf community,"Hi everyone. I'm studying to be a teacher of the Deaf and I was wondering what are people's thoughts on generative AI (like chat gpt and copilot for example) Is it something you wish you had during school? If Yes, what do you think it would be useful for? Is it something you use now as an adult?

[댓글]
Active disdain would sum up my position on generative AI. I have and never had any use for it whatsoever.

Hell no, AI bots can't draw hands

lmao hell no, AI can't replicate sign language, and AI doesn't belong in classrooms.

Fuck AI

![gif](giphy|61Z9YArKrbF6uNAlZY)

A very emphatic NO.

AI/ChatGPT are simply **not** a replacement for real people using ASL.

AI can diaf

It’s not a direct answer to your question but since some people seeing this might be wondering I might as well lol

Every hearing person trying to pander or “save” the Deaf community suggests AI for the same reasons, without even considering the values of the culture (including but not limited to, authenticity). 

AI translation is a lazy and dangerous idea to replace valued interpreters, and strip the culture and authenticity out of our language. 

I would prefer waiting hours for a real certified interpreter for an appointment than instant AI slop translation. Even if it’s “good enough”, I wouldn’t use it.

I am currently working as a Teacher for the Deaf, and though I have coworkers who use generative AI for things (emails, which is ridiculous, lesson planning, developing curriculum, reports), I absolutely refuse. I hate generative AI. If I didn't want to do the work, I wouldn't have gotten my degree!

I work in tech ... security and don't use AI. I assess the security of AI, but would never actually use it in my personal life. We give enough information away for free.

Ai has disastrous ethical and ecological consequences. To me, it’s not worth a family’s access drinking water.

It’s a lazy excuse for institutions, companies, etc to avoid engaging in an actual process to provide accessibility

fuck AI

As a profoundly hard of hearing person, I would’ve used a local large language model and processing system for : class transcription, note taking, studying. 

Smaller models like Gemma 3N can fit on a phone and apps can be built around not sending data anywhere.

EDIT: I’m not sure I understand why I’m being downvoted. I’m not saying “AI” can do any ASL interpretation at all. I’m looking at this as a student trying to study a subject on my own time.

I’m hearing, mum of a deaf teen and an Auslan student. My deaf teacher likes AI for the purposes of emailing hearing people like her students but that’s about it.

I’ve used ChatGPT to check what it knows about deaf community and Auslan, and very little.

1nnt1jy,deaf,This is soo frustrating! 5 month hearing loss,"Our son is 5 months old and was diagnosed with mild hearing loss at 2 months. He’s got hearing aids now and when he’s wearing them he seems (i think) to respond fine. The problem is… he’s 5 months old. Half the time he pulls them out or just plays without them, and he still interacts with us like normal, so it’s hard to read what’s actually going on.

For example, my wife will be on the floor playing with him, and if someone walks in behind him maybe 10 feet away and calls his name, sometimes there’s no reaction at all. Other times I can’t tell if he heard and just chose to ignore us. MRI came back clean. We’ve got genetic testing coming up and are hoping it gives us something concrete.(no one in our family has hearing loss) 

What messes with my head is not knowing if things are stable or changing day to day. He can’t tell us what he’s hearing, and I’m second-guessing every little response. If you’ve been through this with an infant and mild loss, I’d love to hear what helped keeping the aids in, figuring out what’s hearing vs. normal baby distraction, how you kept track without driving yourselves nuts, anything on the genetic testing side whatever you wish someone had told you early on.",2025-09-22 17:36:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nnt1jy/this_is_soo_frustrating_5_month_hearing_loss/

[댓글]
They’re great for mapping music to your hearing loss…

They are NOT hearing aid replacements.

It’s why a premium pair of aids will be £4k plus, and AirPods are £200…

People say great. 

Not know, never try, deaf. 

Friend try airpod hearing aid only problem school (college), or place people think ignore not understand hearing aid.

They’re only recommended up to a certain level of hearing loss. Without knowing the severity of your grandma’s hearing loss, we can’t recommend a product

They are rated for mild hearing loss.  They're better than nothing, but they're not a replacement for traditional hearing aids, especially for moderate to severe losses.

They are not hearing aids

I used AirPods as hearing aids in a tough spot.

They are better than nothing, but not close to comparable to full-fledged hearing aids.

They’re good as amplifiers but there’s too much delay

There’s a lot of cheaper hearing aid options out there from the $19.99 ones at Walmart to $100-$200 refurbished on Amazon.

Nope

I’ve used them for many months between broken hearing aids and new ones. I have specific sharp hearing loss in higher frequencies which makes daily conversations pretty troublesome even if I can “hear” mostly.

AirPods Pro 2 were great for me even before the hearing aid release. The key is making sure transparency mode accessibility stays applied, it likes to turn off into normal non accessibility transparency a lot and isn’t that helpful and what most people likely experienced.

It depends on the nature of the hearing loss. I’ve seen people use them simply as an affordable alternative and because it works for them… barely.

They work okish for me, but my losses are only severe at HFs.

Note that the battery life is maximum about 5 hours.

If she has Medicaid ask them if they cover them.

Severe hearing loss here. They don’t even come close to what my hearing aids provide. I use them for music because streaming to my HA eats up battery life like pac man, and the music sounds better in my air pods. 

The HA function allows me to “get by” at the gym if someone tries to talk with me, but I try to avoid conversations.

I did do the built in hearing test 
And let it adjust based on that. The results were close to my audiogram results at the drs.

I’ve never heard of this. I struggled to listen to anything with airpods in even before my hearing loss became profound. I would rather keep my water-damaged NHS-issued hearing aids 🙏

Your grandma should have insurance, which would give her a free under Insurance pair of Hearing Aids.

There is lots of delay on on them",2025-09-21 18:30:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nmzmok/has_anyone_tried_to_use_airpods_as_hearing_aids_i/

I don't have a CI so I couldn't tell you.  But I've read a fair amount about them and listened to many people who have had one.  The explanations given by musically-trained people are the most interesting to me, since I also have some musical training.  There's a shared language, right?

There's not much bass information.  Melody is scrambled.  Some report perfect pitch recognition with single notes - but it's sort of wonky.  They sometimes hear harmonics not the fundamental.  Whether you would be able to hear a melody  and then hum it back is very much hit and miss varying from person to person.  There is little to no polyphony.  Not much dynamic information either.  But tone textures are often recognizable.  And the rhythm comes through, of course.  (Definitely a lot of percussionists among deaf musicians.)

One thing often reported is that after a few years eventually things start sounding normal.  After all, sound is experienced in the mind.  If they know what music ""should sound like"" a person starts to associate the CI signal with that.

The Sound Of Metal is a truly poor representation of a CI experience.  The only thing they got remotely not offensive to the community was the hearing booth and the frustrations of it.  The rest was unrealistic and silly at best.  

CIs are a process and a big decision.  Retraining your brain to use them takes a lot of time and effort which the character devoted 0% towards.  It’s not a magical cure all.  As a musician, it took more daily training to get music back to normal and an Audi knowledgeable enough to know what they’re doing.  Music is complicated.  More complicated than spoken words.  So yes, they made it unrealistic for dramatic effects 100%.  It’s not a good movie or a good representation of anything IRL.

Not deaf, but can tell you what my mum described when she got her implant 10 years ago. At first, it was very artificial and metallic sounding. She described the initial sounds as being like “the clangers” - an old kids tv show. She said we sounded like toots and whistles. Weirdly she could hear intonation but not actually make out full word sounds. Over time this improved and we started sounding more like we were actually saying words but in a very artificial way. At this stage she said we sounded like Daleks from Dr Who (circa 1970s). So she could make out words but we didn’t sound human. Over time our voices also normalised and we began to sound like humans again, albeit not the best quality. We then became less metallic but sounded squeaky- at this stage she said we sounded like The Chipmunks. Eventually we started to sound ‘normal’ to her. 


Initially she couldn’t make out music at all. Over time she learned to identify some music when she already knew it (thankfully she was a big music fan before she became deaf and had a huge memory bank of music). In the last couple of years she has upgraded to a new processor and this has also helped, and she can vaguely make out melody even in new music she doesn’t know, as long as the music isn’t too ‘busy’. It took several years for her to consider the voices she heard to be ‘normal’ however she had been profoundly deaf for many years before getting it, and was told that the longer you are profoundly deaf, the longer it takes you to adapt as your brain has somewhat ‘forgotten’ how to process the sound information. She was also 49 when she got her implant and younger people tend to have an easier time adapting to the new sound. 

So while there may be some elements of the movie that would ring true to some people (things sounding metallic, music being difficult to hear), it’s been dramatised drastically.

There’s a spectrum of quality so no real way to say for sure. The average CI user hears as well as someone with moderate hearing loss. (CIs do not restore hearing; they “recreate” approximations of sound.) 

Here’s a [video with some samples of how CIs sound](https://youtu.be/bvzXGHstmkM?si=f4t2dBN7X0-cWeok), with some poor and good audio. This is only really looking at clear and short speech samples, though, and [CIs are notoriously poor at rendering music](https://nihrecord.nih.gov/2022/07/08/making-music-enjoyable-cochlear-implant-users), so the film scene is more or less accurate [to the depiction of sound experience without training]. 

But it’s also definitely dramatized as a film because there are deaf musicians, including Wawa’s World (a rapper with a CI) and deaf percussionists, etc.

Hi there! It sounds like you may be new to this community, and it’s great that you have interest and are coming in seeking to learn and understand something that may be outside your norm. 

I understand that to someone new, the idea of hearing loss or deafness can be scary and foreign, and not preferred. However, it’s really important to recognize that a huge part of Deaf culture (capital D) is the notion and recognition that hearing loss is not necessarily a bad thing here. Hearing is great, not hearing is great, and people have lots of different preferences for lots of different reasons. 

Many deaf / HoH people choose to never get CIs, relying only on signed language. Deafness is also a scale, so what people are able to hear differs quite a bit too! But the important takeaway is that deafness is not seen as a disability within the Deaf community, and it’s important that people outside of it see that. 

You might notice that you’re getting downvoted quite a bit for assuming that being deaf / not being able to hear is inherently bad, when that’s not the case! Just think of it as people who speak a different language (some, not all) or have a different culture than you. Deaf people still live beautiful and full lives and are completely capable, not disabled :) This may look a little different to you, but that’s not a bad thing!

The human cochlea contains about 12,000 hair cells to aid in the transmission of sound.  Compare that to a cochlear implant device, which on average contain either 16 or 22 channels.

This movie is very misleading. I would never tell anyone to watch that to understand what it’s like to be deaf and get an implant.  Perhaps it was like that years ago but the technology has come a long ways.  That said, the movie does not reflect all the post implant rehab that is required in order to use the implants effectively.  They are not natural hearing and never will be but with work they can help bridge the gap.

I'll let you in on some culture here: in the Deaf community it is not always that ""hearing something is better than nothing,"" and some people may find that offensive.

Your brain eventually adjusts the sounds to what sounds “normal”. It won’t sound like what non-cochlear hearing is, but you can still enjoy music.

While I’ve had my cochlear implants since I’ve been a young kid, so nearly 19 years, you can come over to the r/cochlearimplants subreddit and find other testimonies.

Hey there! First off, it's spelled ""shitty"" :D

Oral deaf, low-freq loss mostly, gradual decrease from moderate to severe loss over the years. Got my first CI 4 years ago, about to get my other ear implanted in November. 

When my first CI was activated things did indeed sound weird/off - I used to describe voices as sounding like Tinkerbell shouting through a garbage disposal. It took my brain a few weeks to understand how to process the new signals coming from the implant. 

Gradually things improved, and my speech recognition skyrocketed. Nowadays I'm also finding myself noticing / appreciating stuff I wasn't able to hear before, like bass guitars. 

It's kind of a pain at times and and the same limitations that HAs have exist, as nothing yet can really replace natural hearing. Speech recognition is much better in SOME circumstances but still can't handle speech in noise, which definitely includes song lyrics. It definitely does not take the place of sign language (which, yes, I still need to get fluent in) but it was a significant improvement on what I had before the surgery, and arguably a positive change.

I haven't seen that film, but here's my experience:

Im deaf left and hard of hearing right. Been wearing a regular hearing aid since I lost my hearing, got the CI at 13 y/o, after 10 years of being completely deaf at my left ear.

The initial sensation of the sound of a CI didn't feel like sound to me. It was more of a physical feeling. I guess that I was feeling those tiny electric shocks?

At my first therapy session, I couldn't hear a difference between anything. It was all just random noise. A very weird robotic-ish sound. I started experiencing the sound instead of just the physical feeling. It felt agressive, wearing it wore me out like crazy. I remember the drives to therapy, I don't remember any coming back, always asleep in the passenger seat.

After a while, the brain gets used to it. In my case, my brain started mixing the natural sound on the right with the unnatural sound on the left. Together they form a very natural sound. I can't live without it anymore. If i don't wear it, I'll be tired within hours.

If I wear only the CI, it still doesn't sound 100% natural. But its become so much better than what it sounded/felt like initially.

The following video is the closest I've ever found.
https://youtu.be/1dhTWVMcpC4?si=NYa2V18KmlcZFe78

Yeah. Metal conducts sound very differently than bone.

I'm a cochlear implant user here and I just want to say that for me, it doesn't sound like that at all. However I do have a weird vibration sound that occur from base line sounds but it's only minor but majority of my audio sounds  98% natural or very close to it.

I have a CI, it's a miracle. Sound is amazing. No, music is not perfect (like 90% of what I had) but to be able to hear at all is wonderful. Speech is 100% except in loud places (noisy restaurants, crowds).

No, that movie is a POS.

They sound bad for the first few weeks/months, until you adjust to them, and then they sound like regular hearing.

Think about it like someone getting a prosthetic leg. They are going to walk awful I'm the beginning, because they have to adjust. After a few months, they typically will be cruising around pretty similarly to a person with an organic leg.

The cochlea is shaped like a seashell with about 4 turns in it. The electrodes only pass through 1 and 1/2 turns of the outer cochlea. That's also where the high pitched sounds are sensed. So when it's first turned on, everything is high pitched, and sounds horrible. 

When I got mine, I played music even when I was sleeping and did everything to try to adapt. It worked. I now love music. I danced Salsa before getting the implant, but now it's even better. 

I don't hear some of the finer details, my son has guitar pedals that changes the sound quality in ways I can't really hear. But it's not shit.

It's not accurate at all. Maybe when it's first activated, but after many months, it sounds kind of natural. I watched a recap of the movie, before I had my surgery. It only scared me, I was afraid music would be ruined forever. It's not, it's even better. And I am able to listen and understand WITHOUT reading lips (sometimes, not always), which is almost impossible without my cochlear implants. Of course, everyone has different experiences, but I don't like how the movie possibly can scare people from getting a cochlear implant.

So my curiosity got the better of me and I played that clip from the movie. Holy cow that is so inaccurate. That audio sounds crystal clear to my implanted ear.  I don't speak French but I could pick out words I know here and there such as petit (little) and beaucoup (much/a lot) 

This is very much NOT what a newly implanted person would hear. To make it more realistic imagine if this guy was trying to talk through a plastic recorder whistle. then maybe it would be more true to life. It won't start to sound this good for 3-6 months after activation with lots of effort.

CI user here

If my cochlear is picking up sh*tty sounds illegal usually write it down for my bi-annual check up and continue to monitor it in the event that I need to escalate an emergency appointment.

Cochlear (the company) have this program that Audiologists are trained on using to adjust sounds to fit a range from too quiet (aka a library) to too loud (inside a jet of a commercial airplane) so the can get it just right and comfortable for the user

The movie does show some flaws but the experience that most will go through is they feel sh*tty at first but over time it will become natural sounding even if its thru artificial means (NOTE: not everyone's experience is the same some might take longer to get used to it or just not wear it at all)

I was implanted in 2004 when I was just a little over a year old so I dont remember things until at least 5 normally I hear this like faint elongated beep with a bit of ringing as my ear inside my skull is connecting with the external device and then things sound normal the beep is gone and car on with my day by adjusted the sound sensitivity settings in the Nucleus App and things sound like how i imagine most hearing people hear them.

HOWEVER I learned about 4 years ago in 2021 that cochlear implants can detect certain frequencies as ""too high and dangerous"" like a school fire alarm (think fire drills) and temporarily suppresses the sound it recieves to a muffled version not only to make it comfortable for the user but to also internally protect the device from essentially blowing out the processer until you are in an area that it away from the noise that's suppressed

I don't have a CI, but from what I ""hear"" (with my hearing aids), the technology's improved so much over time. It's still not perfect hearing, but it's better compared to when ""sound of metal"" was made.... or at least the setting of the time it was set in, anyways.

Individuals experience with cochlear implants wildly varies. For those who have auditory memory or used since young age, sound different that those implanted later in life after growing up deaf. Someone’s connection with sound also largely depends on their familiarity with it and ability to locate and understand where sound is coming from. This is accurate to some people with CIs but not others, the rest of the movie with the fantasy ASL rehab is unrealistic.

*shrug* I've had mine since before I could form long-term memories. It's normal to me.

CI are good for understanding speech. That’s what they are made for— I stopped listening to music after I got my CI and I got deafer. All sound is noise unless I focus on it.

YouTube gives you an idea of what they sound like. I’d definitely describe it as “cheap $1 headphones” though. I’d personally hate to be a musician stuck with them.

My sister let me know that her implant sounded really weird like metallic and people sounded similar to SpongeBob when it was activated. She said it took several weeks to months to sound right. I’ve also had this experience with hearing aids, which never sounded right so I got a different pair. We both were born with hearing loss so our reference is only hearing aids and any residual hearing we have. 

This movie, as far as I know, is made by a hearing person and it is made for hearing people. So no. It won’t be accurate. It is exaggerated, because drama. If it was activated and sounded the same, there would be less drama and a less compelling story for people to watch. The hearing test is accurate. You don’t need to feel pity for people with CIs. They don’t want pity. They just want understanding.

They've gotten way better since then, but also there's a major difference between artificial and natural hearing. For someone who had hearing I can imagine that being hell. I refused to wear my hearing aids as a kid because the only ones insurance would pay for sounded like the worst microphone on a COD lobby.

There are so many factors that go into what they sound like to the user. That movie is dog shiite though. I wish it had not been made

That movie is incredibly misinformed and offensive",2025-09-21 17:03:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nmxd8d/are_cochlear_implants_sound_really_that_shtty/
1nmmq5b,deaf,College advice,"Hi everyone! I was wondering if ppl might be able to give me some advice for college. Im a hs senior who is applying to colleges right now. I was born profoundly Deaf and even tho my whole family is hearing everyone signs fluently and I was raised with asl as my first language. My mom is an educational interpreter so I know im super blessed bc a lot of Deaf kids dont get thst opportunity. I went to a Deaf preschool and early elementary but then switched to being mainstreamed at my local schools. I grew up doing competitive gymnastics and am part of my high schools varsity cheer squad and love it!

Im doing my college applications and have narrowed them down to three categories:

1) Deaf school- Gallaudet. Pros- all ASL so easy to make lots of friends and get involved in the community. They also have a cheerleading squad. Cons- super far from home. Not sure if i want 100% Deaf i did go to Deaf camp growing up and loved it but love my hearing friends. Less drama 

2) hearing schools closer to home. University of montana for in-state (not msu too close to home bc its where i live now) also utah state and idaho state. Pros- cost even tho im working with VR so that might not be a problem. ISU has some Deaf bc of the sign language, Deaf ed etc programs but not much. Academics are good.  Cons- My hearing friends have learned to sign some better than others. itd be harder to make friends who dont sign and have to start all over again.

3) in between Deaf/hearing. Really this would be CSU Northridge. Pros- they have what im pretty sure it want to study- physical therapy. Lots of Deaf and hearing who sign but also lots of hearing. Living in California sounds super awesome to this Montana girlie!! Cons- farther from home. No cheerleading but thats not a huge deal.

Like I said i think I want to study physical therapy. Maybe teaching but my mom does special education/educational interpretering in our school district and its really hard esp these days so im not so sure. Also im a little worried about trying to work in the hearing world if that makes sense? Like would it be hard to have an interpreter when I work with hearing clients? ive been kinda spoiled with my family signing and my friends being so awesome.  But I've seen lots of stories of Deaf adults having a hard time get basic accommodations and getting discriminated against.

For ppl who went to college where did you go and why? What do you do for work? Is it hard to work as a Deaf person who doesnt talk and only signs (even tho my written  English is really good i think!) What woukd you recommend and is there any advice you have?

Thank you so so so much!!

1. There are hearing students at Gallaudet (Gallaudet has a hearing undergraduate program aka HUG and of course, an interpreting program, but they would be using ASL in most environments. There will also be many deaf and hard of hearing students who are raised oral, so they will bring some of the hearing culture to their circles. So, not 100% Deaf, but the majority will be. 

What about the academics? I’m not sure how transferable their core courses are. Some universities’ core courses (typically taken during your freshman year) are hard to transfer, and Gallaudet was one of them during my time, but that was 10 years ago. Something to keep in mind. 

2. Disability offices in public universities can be a hit and miss, indeed. I did my Master’s at a hearing university (online program), but the disability office has a staff member assigned to only DHH students, and she’s fluent in ASL. I had a great experience with her, but we can’t assume all universities will have that. Generally, the more DHH students a university has, the better — hopefully because then what the heck? 

Because it’s a bit closer to your home, will touring the universities be doable — if you haven’t done so already? If you tour, make sure to visit the disability office and ask them questions. See if you can talk with a deaf student who already attends there for their experience. 

The con - some people address that by finding a local Deaf community they can join outside college and look into ASL clubs or whatever for hearing peers who are learning ASL. Any of those exist at your choice of universities? I’m not from that part of the country. 

3. Any particular reason why RIT is out? Just curious. I checked and it has exercise science as a major. 

FYI, Deaf PTs are something we need more of. School PTs don’t always sign fluently. My Deaf school’s PT doesn’t sign fluently. There is a demand, I think.

I can share my experience. I went to a state college with several Deaf students and I wasn't happy. Transferred to Gallaudet (even though they didn't have my major) and LOVED it. Then went to CSUN for another degree, and wasn't quite happy, but it was tolerable.

Now, I teach ASL, which was never a part of my original plan, but I'm very happy with it, and the network I had with classmates at Gally has really helped me. 

Gallaudet is part of a consortium, and you can take classes at any of the colleges and they will count at Gallaudet. Check to see if any of the consortium colleges has your major.

Loved Gallaudet, but you should also take in consideration financial aid, wtc. If you have to pay for it on your own, I recommend a community college to save money and you can work to save up then transfer to a university.  That said, if you want the full experience, it’s Gallaudet.",2025-09-21 08:38:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nmmq5b/college_advice/
1nmgqqg,deaf,Petition - USA: Restart funding for DeafBlind Children in Wisconsin,"On September 5th 2025, The Department of Education ended funding for the **Wisconsin Deaf Blind Technical Assistance Project.** This is Federally Funded under Idea Act Part D as a grant. The project has filed a re-evaluation, and is awaiting a response before September 30th. After that the program has to close.

**Please help us by signing this petition to get the funding re-instated. Thank you,**

This program is a cornerstone for helping deaf and blind students in Wisconsin. There's 170 families enrolled, and of them, at least 85% have 4 or more disabilities. This program provides guidance for families, training for IFSP and IEPs, ASL services and training, Interveners to help students get the services they need from the schools and conferences for teachers, and educators on how to train and work with Deaf and Blind Students. The program is about $184k / year, and was cancelled under concerns of DEI language in the grant (which terms had already expired), Letter is available on the Milwaukee Journal Article page.

I've already reached out to all of my own State Senators, my Representatives, and my local reps in Wisconsin. I've also reached out within the Department of Education, to try to get this re-instated.

1nme4jj,deaf,Accessibility,"Hi! I’m 20F. I was brought up in a hearing family. As a child, my parents did bring me to doctors appt to get me checked if I was autistic because I don’t budge when I’m called. Doctors found out the reason, I’m js deaf. 

My parents never took it well, I was able to get a proper hearing aids only by 20, and all those years I was forced to lip read (which I’m very grateful I was able to master lip reading.) I had problems in class when I ask too much questions I get reprimanded or yelled at. When I asked for an accessibility in class ny mom found out and she punished  me told me I’m not deaf enough. (I’m profoundly deaf on left, and moderate-severe in right) 

Now, I struggle with my identity, I wish my parents made me learn FSL as a child. I don’t mind being deaf, and I want to connect with my community. But, I just don’t know where to start and I feel like I’m not deaf enough to be in the community.

YOU ARE PART OF US!!  🧏🏻‍♀️ 

It’s never too late to start learning sign language, either.  🤟🏼

I’m sorry exact same! 
Start a healing journey. 
I found out at 45 I had an IEP the entire time in school and it was never acted on. My hearing parents failed 
Set boundaries. Put yourself first. Call your nearest community college and ask to enroll in ASL. 
It’s so horrible how deaf children are treated even by their own families. 
Keep us updated on your journey!

I had a similar situation but your parents are far worse. Now that you're an adult I suggest adding a lot of distance. 


Take sign language classes as soon as you can. Start interacting with other deaf people. There are many different ways to be deaf and yours is just over of them. 


I don't know options specific to your country though.

Hello there! The De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde has a very vibrant Deaf community and students your age. Feel free to enroll in their FSL classes offered every term. That's a short time to wait because Benilde is trimestral. Send them an email here or visit their Facebook for any questions you may have. The deaf festival is scheduled this November and it's open to the public! deaf.partnerships@benilde.edu.ph some of the students there also only learned FSL as an adult. You're definitely not alone.

I tried to see if your school (I took a look at your post and comment history) 
has a program that would include Sign Language. Unfortunately all I could find was this article and having pharmacists learn American sign language. This makes very little sense to me. As far as I can tell the Deaf community there uses FSL, why use another country's sign language?

T-coil is old school. And often thought of as solely for a telephone handset. But it is very general purpose.  Short-range analog radio transmission.  

Some headsets have a t-coil. (Some have one on each side for stereo.) There are T-coil loops that go over the neck and which plug into a standard headphone audio jack. You can also get units which are more powerful and will transmit over a bit of distance.

Use your mini mic or ""TV streamer"" plugged into the speaker port of your computer, then use a separate mic such as the one built into your webcam.

I wear a CI and a HA. I got the Bose Quietcomforts which also have an inbuilt mic. They work great and fit over the CI. The HA does emit a slight whistling noise but it’s drowned out when someone is speaking or when music is playing. I used to have the Cochlear mini mic, but this only streams audio to the CI.

I would never choose a CI or hearing aid that doesn’t pair with laptops/phones and other devices. I just can’t see how one could make that work. I don’t do phone calls even with pairing 😔

I use the bluetooth mini microphone device plugged into my laptop to hear and I have a separate stand alone mic to speak into.

i had already posted this before basically in january i wanted to get a driving license because im tired of driving motorbike (for 4years) and the ""doctor examiner"" refused to approve me because i was ""too deaf"" , he basically did his little test of hiding his mouth and whisper to me and i have to REPEAT AFTER HIM , i could hear him obviously but not understand any of it so i failed , it is weird how overstrict he was and claimîg to follow the law when that industry is known for corruption (basically you have to tip/bribe driving monitor or engineers that the examiner work closely with and who does final driving test and gives final say TO PASS) and yet with me he ""was just following the law""?! 
i do not understand what does understanding human speech not just hearing hit has to do with my ability to drive a car , my hearing aids can hear the cars and their honkings and sirens. 
i have tried various hearing aids this year and yes they all suffer from clarity problem .... this harsh and cruel examiner is clearly just afraid of liability even if i was drunk driving with eyes shut they will come after him for approving a deaf person to drive ... the cretira from 2010 he claims to strictly follow does not even have hiding your mouth requirment .. and it says when the client is corrected with hearing aids or cochlear he has to ""perceipt"" whispered voice .. does perception have to mean understanding or just detection ?! 

i guess like he said he will retire in 2026 so hopefully the new examiner is not overly strict .. this is too cruel it is almost only done with people with barely any deafness not profound deafness. and im too shy to talk to media or associations .
the image is the cretira (it is in french since il from morocco which is a very corrupted country ) .

Wow wtf. This is so fucked

What's wild is that I could probably get an International Driver's Permit and drive there. I don't hear anything, even with hearing aids.

This looks like a French speaking country?

In the USA you can legally drive without hearing - you just need to be able to see properly to be able to read road signs and see indicators and brake lights, things like that.

I’ve had some U.S. citizens be discriminatory before by saying it’s so risky for a deaf person to drive, but emergency vehicles use flashing lights, and almost every significant driving-related sign, hazard, or info-display is dependent on having eyes that can see.

There is absolutely no reason that anyone who is deaf can’t drive. Even people who CAN hear, they don’t pay attention and still get into wrecks. As long as you’re paying attention to the road and the traffic around you, you can 100% be a safe driver.

I’ve never heard of being deaf restricting ability to get a drivers license.
The covering his mouth thing is wild.

Wow, I got a driver license without hearing aids 30 years ago.

That's crazy. I hope the law changes.

In the US

This would violate the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990

In some states its considered Medical Malpractice 

And per the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 the following vehicles are required to have flashing lights because of sirens: police, ambulance, Fire trucks.

The crazy part about this is that hearing humans are equally deaf in cars as Deaf people are... they turn on the radio, and the car itself is mostly sound-proofed against most things outside of it unless it's really loud, like a train nearby, etc. And the number of times I've seen hearing people become distracted drivers while on their phone to the point that they're deaf to everything else around them.

Isn't it possible to call for support among deaf people in Morocco against these regulations? It may be a long rough way but it has to start somewhere.

This is so wrong I’m deaf and drive just because he whispered I bet there would be a fair % of “hearing” who wouldn’t have been able to reply and it a moot point - you heard him speak just not the clarity - so when cars have there stereo blasting  - or talking on there hands free - does that not effect them. 

I tend to be much more aware because I’ve not got the sounds 


I hope you are able to appeal

How many y'all hear tinnitus in the brain like middle of brain its coming middle of my head close to my left ear. Doesnt feel like coming from ears my jaw movements doesnt affect that much

[댓글]
I don’t hear it in my ears or jaw but I’ve gotten used to over years that i can’t tell you what part of my brain i hear it in.

I used too until I got cochlear implant

Mine definitely comes from the inner ear / left right. I do have it 24/7 though. The tuneless soundtrack to my life.

All tinnitus is in your brain or brain stem. That's what makes it tinnitus.

Everyone is different so that sound of your jaw movement is what you hear.
I hear the tinnitus because I am deaf and this is the sound that I hear. Like the ocean waves or the sound of crickets in my ears. Sometimes clicking is another noise but once my hearing aids are in and my Cochlear Implant  is connected the sound of ringing is gone. I can now hear real sounds of voices talking to me and all earth sounds are good.

Always subtly very low in the background.

I've had tinnitus for most of my life. Mine is a constant buzzing/whine noise, I only ""hear"" it on my left side because I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve). It never gets quieter, but it sometimes gets louder. Sometimes, it becomes that typical buzzing sound with a steady ""thrumming"" over it (sounds kind of like a washing machine sounds when the load is uneven). That pulsatile tinnitus comes and goes.

Both ears and also feel and hear it in my brain.

I have different types of tinnitus left/right cause I different damages to my ears. Sometimes its a loud ringing sound though that has diminished since my hearings gotten worse. Now its more of a pressure shift change that kinda whines and then completely fades out and I cant hear anything.",2025-09-20 01:06:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nlkvx8/how_many_yall_hear_tinnitus_in_the_brain_like/

So this leaves me in a position I didn’t anticipate because he travels some and I’m alone with 3 kids.  If the light flickering didn’t wake me up and the noise didn’t wake me up what can I use?

I relate to a lot of CODA content as I grew up helping my mum, talking on the phone on her behalf (often even pretending to be her!) from about 10ish onwards, ‘translating’ for her at events and parties, and for TV shows as most didn’t have subtitles (subtitles were so bad in the 90s/00s). I’ve since went to my own BSL classes and have engaged in some Deaf events which is where I came across the phrase CODA. But I didn’t experience the cultural differences between the Deaf and Hearing communities, like I know people who grew up in Deaf (signing) families would have.

Get me in a busy restaurant or in a group with multiple people talking and I'm done.  I do lip read to help but it is just exhausting to concentrate all day long to understand what people are saying to me.   

At night, it is just relief to remove my processor and not have to hear anymore.  To just lay there and not have to concentrate on others is so relaxing.

1njnx3c,deaf,"Argument: Hard-of-Hearing Should be an Identity, Not a Subgrouped Label","Please feel free to counterargument; I would love to hear anyone’s thoughts about this, especially HOH people, but also in the larger ASL/DHH community.

I have this friend who’s Hard-of-Hearing, born into a hearing family, and communicates orally with her family and signs/SimComs at school. She told me last year that she doesn’t feel Deaf enough, but she's also not hearing. I told her that there's no one way to be Deaf. That the Deaf identity is there for all people with hearing loss to claim. But is it? There’s no auditory frequency or decibel that determines a boundary between who qualifies as Deaf and who is HOH, but my friend isn’t even close to the first HOH person to make this connection between her own identity and the common one of the Deaf community because of her hearing and cultural differences. What if I had told her that it’s ok to be HOH, that her identity is shared by millions of people, that she was ""Hard-of-Hearing enough""?

And what if this experience and others like it are so common for HOH individuals that they share their own culture without even knowing about it? 

For starters, HOH people (as opposed to Deaf) can naturally hear a good amount of sound, it's just less clear and more challenging for them to distinguish sounds from a hearing person. Because of this, they tend to be more aware of the greater hearing environment than most Deaf people would be. They also usually struggle with their HOH identity, different than how a Deaf person might. One intent behind the Deaf identity as an umbrella term was to combat elitist behaviors, but by doing this, it may be restricting the expirences of HOH people who have a signed language backround, who can hear enough to talk to hearing people and Deaf enough to talk (sign) with Deaf people, igniting a strong feeling of alienation as an outcast of both Deaf and Hearing society. And even when a HOH person perhaps has adopted a Deaf identity and Deaf people accept them as Deaf, several might still feel that deep down they know they’re not “Deaf like everyone else,” because of their different hearing abilities. These contradictory emotions might be comparable to the feelings of those who are biracial or bisexual, like being sandwiched between two perceived unambiguous identities.

A lot of Deaf culture also derives from the bing(asl)/ typicality(English) of someone who hears little to nothing, like the mutual understanding of waving, tapping, or flickering lights to get one’s attention, but I’ve seen more HOH than Deaf people use their voice to call out to another HOH person. As opposed to common Deaf culture values, sometimes HOH people are used to Sim-Comming, given their educational or social Sim-Commed environments, and there have even been a number of HOH people who told me it feels more natural than voice off. Sometimes less obvious things like bluntness or physical contact, two integral components of Deaf culture, might not feel as natural to someone who moves between both cultures.

I remember this one time where I was signing with a HOH kid, around the age of 7, and I had used a word (forgot what it was) that kids her age should know, but she didn’t understand what it was. I then tried to explain it, finger spell it, and voiced it, but she didn’t understand the sign, nor could she understand the word I voiced. I would call this a less severe version of language deprivation, specifically since her parents wrote her hearing loss off as Hearing but just “auditorily impaired,” even if the term itself wasn’t used. They saw she still had a good amount of usable hearing, and didn’t provide enough resources to compensate for the rest of the information she was bound to miss. But now we’re left with a large quantity of HOH kids who aren’t 100% fluent in any signed or spoken language, which has been directly influenced by their environment (family, school, etc.) because of the amount of hearing they have.

\[Note: I believe that signed languages, although they can be used solely as a method of accommodation, don’t have to be, as they are inherently equal to their spoken counterparts\]

I actually did my dissertation research on this topic. Always meant to try get it published somewhere, never got round to it... got a good mark tho :)

I agree with your central argument btw.

My central finding - and opinion in general as a HH person - is that the core feature of HH identity is the ability to hear (esp speech, but other sounds too) in a lot of settings (quiet, 1:1), but not all settings (loud, group settings, background noise).

Usually a HH person is somewhat acculturated to hearing society, but not fully - and tend to find Deaf spaces easier to navigate *if* they can sign - although many cannot and feel isolated.

&gt; I would call this a less severe version of language deprivation

There is a term for this - the ""hidden curriculum"".

* [What is Hidden Curriculum? - Examples, Pros &amp; Cons (2025)](https://helpfulprofessor.com/hidden-curriculum/)
* [Hidden Curriculum \[Sociology\]](https://www.simplypsychology.org/hidden-curriculum.html)

It is applied to more than just DHH people, but missing out on it is a pretty core DHH experience for pretty much all of us on the DHH spectrum.

When I briefly worked as a TA with Deaf kids, we used that term.

Being hard of hearing (HH) is a distinct identity, IMO, and perfectly valid. My take on this: 

1. Using 'deaf' as a catch-all is often more inclusive. That's why you see that conflation of deaf and HH folks or the HH label/identity being taken over by the deaf label. 
2. Deaf, hard of hearing, deaf, deafblind, deafdisabled, etc, are all valid identities under this catch-all of deaf. 
3. Some people who are HH identify as Deaf or deaf because of cultural reasons (I know several!). 
4. Some people say they are deaf or Deaf because it is easier to explain to others than hard of hearing. 
5. All of these things are perfectly fine and valid. 

I say all of this as a culturally Deaf person who works in a Deaf environment. While I obviously have a preference for sign language, identifying as deaf or Deaf, it is still up to that person how they identify, which also changes with setting, context, cultural factors, etc. 

Side note - a suggestion: this is a wall of text. Please get to the point more clearly, I had to re-read it a few times lol

I personally identify as HOH as I fluctuate between mid, moderate, and almost severe. I was a mild moderate, but that changed slightly as I got older. To me, I can hear okay without my hearing aids, but I can tell a difference when I wear them. Also, sometimes with my hearing aids, I might still ask to repeat things. To me, I don’t feel like a subgroup; I am just a HOH member of the community. I went to my local mainstream school, and my preferred communication mode is speaking, not ASL. While I do know ASL, it is more of a second/third language that I use to communicate with my Deaf sibling or other members of the community not something I grew up speaking since birth. Growing up with my Deaf sibling also shaped my perspective on how I identify myself, as we both went to different schools and had different life experiences. For example, the interactions I have with hearing people are different than my sibling, as I can sometimes pass for hearing. So for me, HOH fits, as it explains why I can’t always hear what hearing people hear. Identifying as Deaf is not something that fits. I once had a hearing person ask how long I have been deaf and I had to correct them because I have not ever considered myself as Deaf, only HOH.

Is it possible for HOH to be its own identity, while *also* being a subgroup under other umbrella terms?

I didn’t read all of it but deafness is a spectrum. As an HOH person i definitely have level of deafness but i don’t concern myself with labels much. I need a hearing aid to hear, without one I’m really not hearing much more than door slams and car crashes. I definitely relate more to HOH but situationally it’s 1000x easier to tell stranger asking you for directions or a cashier “I’m deaf” than it is explaining “I’m Hard of Hearing.”

I feel you. I think the reason why it would be difficult to realize a standalone HoH community like the Deaf community is that not everyone would agree on whatever definitions you or I choose it to mean. There’s also a lot of internalized ableism to contend with.

I’m primarily oral. I pass for hearing. But my hearing isn’t great. I know ASL but I feel most comfortable with SimCom. I’ve been involved with my local Deaf community and have been told on multiple occasions that I’m Deaf and welcomed there. I accept that but there will always be some lingering feelings of imposter syndrome. My understanding is that being deaf is a spectrum and those that are deaf, Deaf, HoH, late-deafened, APD, etc, are all part of that.

No. Then there has to be a separate group for CI-users, since they aren’t Deaf and aren’t HoH, according to your definitions. Oh, wait, I hear those with tinnitus demanding their own label, since they definitely don’t want to be mixed with HoH or Deaf. Their expensive is ”unique” after all! And what about Menière? They definitely want to be recognized, because how could a HoH, CI-user, person with tinnitus or Deaf person understand their experience with dizzy spells? And those born with hearing loss refuse to mix with those who get hearing loss due to old age.

The problem is that it’s hard to influence anything and improve the conditions for us, if different sub-groups constantly fight and disrespect each other. What we have in common is also important. Yes, today there are different organizations for HoH and for Deaf. That’s normal, we do need to be able to discuss issues that are specific to a subgroup. However, we will not be heard as a group if not collaborating. Maybe we need a new term for what to call all groups together? 

One challenge is how to handle the school situation, if parents to CO-users want them to go to Deaf schools, but also get listening and speech practice.

I can hear bass. Quite well, actually.  For example, the other day I went out for a walk. And this WHOOOM sound fired up and I was like ""Oh that must be the vacuum truck I saw yesterday"" and indeed it was. I could hear it from a full block away like 200 metres or more. I can hear truck engines. I can hear low-frequency alarms. I'm able to detect a man shouting almost as well as a hearing person.

That experience really clashes with a deaf conception of the self, you know?

But I have almost no high frequency hearing on one side and not much on the other. I can't hear well enough to understand speech without assistance. And sometimes it still doesn't work.

Which makes me deaf. But it feels like I can hear.

I think bigger dividers are pre or postlingual hearing loss and whether someone is verbal or not. Obviously knowing ASL even if you might not be 100% fluent or are more comfortable with English influenced signing of whatever kind. 

But like for HoH, someone born that way is almost always very different with their identity than an older adult who lost some of their hearing after talking and hearing for years. And like me I Def say Im Deaf even tho Im mainstreamed in a hearing school with all hearing family bc Im not verbal and use ASL with interpreters at school and written English which is my 2nd language.

If we're just talking about different ways to identify than the traditional Deaf vs. deaf/HoH etc. I think those things are more important to groups and identity than level of hearing loss and if you have CIs/HAs. Like i have HAs but still am not HoH either bc i dont speak or lip read or do anything verbal really beyond a few super basics.

These are just some random thoughts I'm Def not expert on any of this and think we should come together more as one than try to divide up more ♡♡♡

I accidentally wrote an essay, sorry!!!! And it is totally okay if people disagree with me, these are just my feelings. 

I view Deaf, deaf, and HoH as parralell and inclusive labels. I don't consider myself deaf (yet) but I am hard of hearing, yet there are many Deaf people who by some metrics are hard of hearing rather than profoundly deaf. There are also people who would consider themselves all three, or any combo of two of those labels. It's kind of a Venn diagram situation, I think. Being Hard of Hearing is its own identity already, but it's also explicitly related to the deaf identity (many hard of hearing people become deaf over time, already consider themselves deaf or Deaf, need accessibility tools made for both Deaf and deaf people, learn ASL, etc.) I dont think you can separate these identities further without potentially excluding people from a label that might be useful to them. Its three categories, but they stand in relation to each other and sometimes overlap without one necessarily being ""under"" the others.

For example, all of the following people exist:

A deaf person who is also Deaf. Many of us are or know someone like this. They dont consider themselves hard of hearing. They are deaf but more importantly, they are Deaf! :) 

A hard of hearing person who grew up hearing, whose sound perception is likely to fluctuate between better and worse over their lives, is learning ASL and trying to participate in Deaf culture to empower themselves and contribute to the community. They probably won't ever be truly Deaf, they may become deaf, but its very possible they'll become both more deaf and more Deaf as time goes on. (me!) 

A deaf person (according to their audiogram) who is not Deaf, who lives in the hearing world and prefers to consider themselves hard of hearing because they communicate entirely in English and use HoH adaptive strategies to ""hear"". I think a lot of people have grandparents like this, I know I did.

A late blinded person who also has some late hearing loss, whose complete blindness makes his experience of being hard of hearing much different than the ""average"" hard of hearing person. He can't supplement with lip reading, captions, or traditional ASL and doesnt have access to tactile ASL education. (My grandpa!)

A deaf person with a CI who had speech therapy growing up and no ASL due to audism, and can ""pass"" as hearing to hearing people sometimes, but may have been excluded from Deaf spaces despite being profoundly deaf. 

A deaf person with significant language deprivation who isn't fluent in either ASL or English. 

CODA who are culturally Deaf with ASL as their first language but have all or most of their hearing. 

A CODA who is culturally Deaf and hard of hearing but not deaf. ASL is their first language but they are fluent in verbal English too. They may see themselves as Deaf and hard of hearing but not deaf!

An ASL and English fluent Deaf person who also got a CI, and is still Deaf! Just able to hear a little now, kind of, sometimes. They're  still deaf, too, just with a CI that makes it possible to hear a little bit, even if its still hard. Maybe they do or don't consider themselves hard of hearing in addition to being Deaf and deaf.

A hard of hearing person who is becoming more deaf but has no experience with ASL or Deaf culture. 

There are real people like all of those descriptions. Not all labels easily fit all of these people, and who can truly define the thresholds and boundaries around those labels in a way that includes everyone who needs to be i cluded? Two people with the same audiogram can live totally differently and use different labels and have different accessibility needs. And yet all of these people probably have experiences that overlap and unify them with other deaf/Deaf/HoH people. We have so much we can learn from each other, and our solidarity makes us stronger. None of these people's experiences are ""wrong"" or bad, they're just ways to go about living and are richer and more complicated than can be expressed in a or to three word label.

So I guess my opinion for my place in this is....yes I am hard of hearing and not deaf or Deaf. But I dont feel like I am just categorized as a subset of being deaf, I feel like....I am standing alongside the deaf and Deaf groups - not (currently) in and not (necessarily) under their group, but WITH their group. We are together :)

My counter argument: the real world does not care about those labels and identity. Move on and do better things with your time.",2025-09-17 20:12:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1njnx3c/argument_hardofhearing_should_be_an_identity_not/
1njgiwi,deaf,Technology suggestions for students,"I work in Deaf and Hard of Hearing class in an elementary school. 

Does anyone have suggestions for a bracelet or other gadget to alert students when they are in the bathroom for lockdowns or secure schools.

Currently the fire alarm lights can't be modified for the different kinds of events and not all students have personal devices.

For both secure school and lockdowns students must close/lock doors and stay where they are. For lockdowns the lights must be turned off, stay quiet, hide, etc.

We need something that will not make noise, won't be too bright, but has vibration and small lights to alert students between the different alerts.

So it would clearly show (or we would teach them that different patterns mean) lockdown or secure school.

We were thinking something similar to what restaurants have that vibrate and have lights when tables are ready but I wanted to know if there is something so that when the students receive the alert, they can click something to turn it off so that it stops making vibrations and lights and then, by turning it off, notifies us that they have received the alert (and then trust they proceed with the protocol).

Because they would be taking this with them, I was hoping there was a bracelet option or lanyard option so that students are less likely to leave the device on the counter or something.

Thank you, in advance, for help and suggestions!

Apple Watch.  Doesn't need to be the latest model. You can send a group text to all the D/HoH wearing them.  I worked in a place with huge group of D/HoH and we wore watches (not these but similar - they predated the Apple Watch) and it would send a buzz and message Fire when the fire alarms went off.  You signed in and out daily for these and they charged them overnight for you.

I think your approach is missing the boat. 

wearable tech for elementary school students seems silly and wasteful. Any such device will be forgotten, won't be recharged, children will break them, and/or disassemble them out of boredom or curiosity.  

Are you implying that if there's a lockdown drill and a child is in the bathroom they're expected to stay there? 

What ways are the hearing children alerted to a lockdown drill? 

[https://passk12.org/lockdown-drills/a-guide-to-effective-lockdown-drills-for-k-12-schools/](https://passk12.org/lockdown-drills/a-guide-to-effective-lockdown-drills-for-k-12-schools/)

I've seen some buildings have a system so that any time an alarm is on, all of the TVs in the building played a pre-recorded video. Obviously that won't work for the bathroom unless you have a lot of money to pay for monitors and setup. Another building had a marquee that would scroll the English warning for us to read it.

Flashing light in the bathroom with instructions written/pictured below. 

Wearable seems like a bad idea.

&gt;when they are in the bathroom for lockdowns or secure schools.

I don't follow. Could you please clarify? I assume we use different terminology than where you live.

Like a fire drill?

In many Deaf schools there is a loud emergency siren that plays whenever “lockdown mode” is initiated.
This can make the intruder disoriented and on edge.
But most importantly this allows for Deaf students not to attract the intruder by making noise they are unaware of.
Deaf children cannot be quiet, it’s impossible. Even as a deaf adult it’s nearly impossible for me.
I think this system should be the default in any school that has elementary aged children as well.
Deaf schools also have flashing bells for class switching. I suppose there may be an SOS in morris code set up to alert the students of what is happening.
Definitely look into what Deaf schools have implemented for their students.

Light flashing each room even bathroom

They do come with sound color code

1njggsp,deaf,Best Deaf-friendly cities in the U.S. for living prospects?,"Edit: forgot to include my age group because that’s probably relevant to this - I’m in the 25-35 age group.

Hi. I’m in Rochester, NY. I’m living independently, but I can’t drive and have some health issues that make it tough to get around (I try anyway), plus money is tight. I was wondering how other Deaf people make a living despite the discrimination or just generally avoiding the depression spiral. 

Should I stay here and make the best of it, or go somewhere else? 

A side note, Rochester is always quoted as a city with a big Deaf community, but most of the big stuff seem to be at RIT/NTID in the outer suburbs, not the actual city itself. I hardly ever see any signing when I go out, if ever. 

[댓글]
Your inability to drive is going to be a bigger barrier than not being able to hear. Plus, the job market is extra f@#$ right now. It's the worst I've seen it since the recession almost 20 years ago, maybe worse but I have a good job this time. My wife (hearing) has a master's degree and she had to totally pivot to a new career and even then it's not steady work like before. 


You don't say what your skills or interests are. Jobs like overnight stocking or custodial work are generally available and adequate pay.

That’s tough. Cities tend to have better public transportation than rural/suburban areas but the cost of living tends to be high. Like, I know Austin is often included as one of the most Deaf-friendly cities, but the cost of living is high, and the public transportation can be a hit or miss, depending on which part of the city you live in. Job opportunities depend on many factors.

Your best shot is any location where deaf communities are prominent. Washington DC is an option because of Galladuet. Deaf communities imo tend to be a hit or miss. It best to move with or to someone you know. If you cant drive, that sucks because few cities have capable public transportation. I would just stay in Rochester unless you're dead set on going somewhere else out of boredom.",2025-09-17 15:35:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1njggsp/best_deaffriendly_cities_in_the_us_for_living/

Yes, sounds deaf to me. Congrats welcome to the club.

Hello! Welcome! Happy to have you. Please go read the post from yesterday about being “deaf enough” I think you’ll feel better 💕

You're exactly where you belong, friendo!

Welcome here!!

Nice to have you with us! You're in the right place. It is a good place to come and be encouraged for a little while. We are trying to build a warm, friendly, positive environment online where people can share their experiences, ask for advice, and voice their feelings etc. Hope you will feel welcomed here too.

Your welcome here, I am hard of hearing myself and have been to that subreddit you mentioned. This subreddit is not mostly about audiograms or if any and is very welcoming to those who are hard of hearing as we have similar experiences. Also they have HOH flair so people know that you’re Hard of Hearing when you comment or post.

Welcome!

It’s the same issue in the r/monohearing  (single sided hearing loss) community too. All they’re doing is talking about their reports and if they’ll get their hearing back. Being deaf in one ear is certainly challenging and has it's ups and downs but the deaf community here is here for you.

Welcome!

I'm deaf, welcome.

I kinda think being deaf is a spectrum. it’s not always 100% zero hearing. I think it’s being able to vent and share experiences relating to our hearing (or lack thereof).

What did you say I didn’t catch you? Listen my docs say many words they assume many things tell me I’m HoH in my left ear and dB deaf in my right and all I know is that I finally lost low/mid dBs in my left ear which makes it now almost impossible to watch tv, talk to people in busy environs, play games , listen to podcasts, hear the birds and the wind etc and i’m so empty and thin in my right ear because im stupid and worked for to long at my last job/industry. I swear i dont even remember my voice. Anyways what i’m trying to say is in 2021 i hurt my ears theyve gotten progressively worse and the only way to have been safe was to never leave the house or try to be normal at work or with friends and family because of rhe judgement or inability for them to accommodate me from their perfectly little lives  so i yeah ive had many stages of hearing loss and i cannot fathom whats next and i dont know if i want to so be welcome and merry here i suppose. I think what im trying to say is that if id had a safe space in the beginning maybe things would be different for me.",2025-09-17 12:05:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1njba2p/welcomed/
1nj0l8v,deaf,"Has Microsoft ""Broken"" CART Captioning?","Towards the end of last year, the CART captioning feature in Teams stopped working. There were no errors or messages - in fact, the MS Teams server still responds ""OK"" when a valid captioning message is sent to it - the captions simply stopped appearing, never to be seen again.   
  
For some meetings, I can understand that the automatic captioning provided by Teams is adequate but if you need really accurate captioning for important meetings and events there is still nothing to beat a good stenocaptioner who can handle accents and complex / unusual language! Hence, there are likely plenty of end users and captioning providers who still want this feature. :)  
  
A number of captioning providers have the same issue (CART captions are broken) but tell me they have given up and are advising their clients to move to Zoom if they want CART captioning integrated with the meeting app.   
  
I reported the problem to Microsoft in *February 2025* and have been in contact with them almost every week since (they take days to answer each message) but they have apparently not been able to reproduce or fix the problem for themselves!!!!  This is strange, as I can make it happen on any Operating system, device and browser, and with each client MS Teams account I have tried, as well as my own account.   
  
Have they quietly ""broken"" CART captioning because they no longer want to support it? 

I would been keen to know if anyone still successfully using CART captions in MS Teams. If so, with which captioning provider and captioning platform? Or are you seeing the same problem that I am (CART captions were working but not anymore)? Can anyone shed any light on this?

  
Thanks so much.



[댓글]
I have an occasional client who uses Teams, and they were stalled on captioning 4-6 months ago when Teams Live Events came on the scene (at least I think that's what it's called.) We tested sending real human-derived 608 captions to it, using a real caption encoder, and that did work. But their former internal AI caption method stopped working. I don't think they tried CART with a human, though. Suffice it to say, something did change.

Their eventual work-around was to add a proxy meeting attendee and have just it do internal AI captions, then add it to the group, or stream that computer to the Live Event (whatever the current name is). They lost speaker identification in the deal, however.

Does Teams handle 3rd-party captions like Zoom does, with an API or a URL to send data to? You might look at StreamText to see if they have a handle on it. Or just use StreamText in another window.

On edit:  I presume this approach is the one that's not working...

""CART captions are available in Microsoft Teams as an option chosen by the meeting organizer. To provide captions, the meeting organizer must invite the CART captioner to the meeting and provide them with a special link to connect their captioning software to the meeting.""

I’m a captioner.  It’s been a while since I’ve embedded captions into MS Teams.  However, I am part of a CART Committee and I’m going to reach out to my committee and see what their experiences are and what we can do.",2025-09-17 01:59:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nj0l8v/has_microsoft_broken_cart_captioning/

1nirp85,deaf,The movie “A Quiet Place”: good representation?,"Hi all! I am the vice president of ASL club at my college (I’m hearing, we don’t really have any Deaf students)

I want to show A Quiet Place in October, because horror movie with a Deaf actor and ASL! Just wanted to ask ppl in the community their opinions on the movie because I know the CI scene was not very accurate, but I do love this movie. Thanks for any input :)

[댓글]
It's a movie for a hearing audience. The complicated family dynamic with the deaf daughter and the parents was realistic, but don't assume it's typical in any way. 


The way the deaf character covers her ears when the monster is present, is not realistic at all. 


As far as deaf representation, it's pretty good, not every family with a deaf child is willing to learn ASL though, so consider this family is a little atypical for the sake of the plot.

I don’t mind the CI inaccuracy. Yes, the script was clearly written with a hearing aid in mind rather than a CI but they chose an authentically Deaf actor as the most important thing over what device she uses for the plot and that’s okay with me.

The other points mentioned in Surdo’s comment are all true.

I and Deaf/HoH (use hearing aides) and I absolutely loved this movie when it came out. I love horror movies and the fact that Millie is Deaf and uses ASL was such a meaningful thing to see in a mainstream movie. I loved the ending. 

I also wanted to say, as another commenter said, that Hollywood representation isn’t perfect… but it has gotten better! We need representation of all types of characters and relationships. Enjoy watching this movie with your club members/class.

Also wanted to say… I watched Children of a Lesser God when I was in college cause I heard it was the first movie with a Deaf character and actor portraying that character. My hearing mom asked what I thought about it — it had been decades since she saw it… and I told her I enjoyed it for what it was at the time it was made… but boy it did not hold up well to time. We had a good laugh about that and how that often happens with movies and tv shows.

My Deaf ASL teacher loves the movie, and recommended it. 


I'm hearing, so my opinion is less important here. But I'd say Hollywood movies aren't perfect representation-- for *lots* of people or things. 


Are you watching it with the attitude that it's for fun and enjoyment? Cool. Are you trying to make it a serious educational opportunity about representation? Maybe pick a documentary.


I think it's totally an appropriate selection for October. Then in November you could do a documentary or film that's got more substantive Deaf representation or issues.

I think the movie has good representation, actually when I was in my Undergrad my university’s ASL club played this movie during halloween. When the trailer first came out my Deaf sibling was so surprised to see sign language on the movie screen. Me and my parents were surprised at first because we thought there was no way they were actually using ASL. We loved the movie and thought it was great. I now know after watching the end I could actually survive in this world. I got a real kick out of the ending as me and my sibling both wear hearing aids. Have not seen the other yet, so idk how good those movies are.",2025-09-16 19:46:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nirp85/the_movie_a_quiet_place_good_representation/

I was brought up entirely hearing. My parents knew I had some issues after I was ill as a baby but never actually told me I was hard of hearing. I went to the audiologist every year and thought it was just something everyone did, like the optician and dentist.

The appts stopped when I was a teenager, so I assumed that was normal.

I found out when I was 19 and had a free health check from university that my records said I had hearing loss, had a check up and was told I needed hearing aids. I ran a mile. I am now middle-aged and finally ready to accept I am deaf. I have joined my local Deaf club, am learning BSL and wearing my hearing aids proudly.

I have a HUGE amount of resentment against my family, they minimise the issues I have had, and I clearly remember constantly being told off in school and at home for not listening, not paying attention, talking over people, being too loud etc. I would be punished by my parents for things that were directly resulting from my hearing loss. Even now they refuse to discuss my hearing loss/aids/signlanguage qualifications as 'im not that deaf' 
My sister even has a Deaf neice and tells me she's 'properly' deaf and I'm just being dramatic. While I'm literally wearing hearing aids given to me by the NHS.


I don't talk to them much anymore.

That! We are all Deaf enough.

I was born hearing, and did not begin to lose my hearing until I was 18 years old. I woke up one day, missing a large portion of my ability to hear and went to the doctor where they diagnosed me with a genetic degenerative disorder which causes my hearing loss in random chunks. I got hearing aids and had them for a number of years until about a year ago where I lost another massive chunk and I am now legally deaf. I am completely verbal and I have some hearing as long as I have my hearing aids on. But I can sign and my children and family sign at home with me when I don’t want to wear my hearing aids. I teach my students at school to sign with me, and when my administration found out that I would likely eventually become profoundly deaf during my teaching career, they began to make plans to find ways to keep me in the classroom And make sure that I never have to leave or stop doing what I love. I am honestly so grateful. I am deaf and proud to be deaf. I am someone my students can see having a “disability” and being successful. And I’ve inspired some of my students to seek out becoming interpreters. (Extremely lacking in my area.) I am extremely rural, so I have met two other deaf people in my entire life, the closest Deaf meet up is multiple hours away. I am likely the first and maybe one of the only, deaf people my students ever encounter.

I grew up hearing in a family that spoke English. 
I'm late deaf /HoH 

Now, I'm going to college and learning ASL.

I just got fitted  for BTE hearing aids. I picked bright colors. I'm not going to hide my hearing loss. I'm not ashamed.

I'm hesitant to identify as deaf because I am so oral.  And I don't sign much.

I was mostly born this way.  I had a head injury in my 30s that pushed me from moderately HoH to something closer to deaf.

I was schooled orally, almost exclusively.  I had hearing aids and speech therapy.  I was a bright kid and I was able to mask very effectively because of that.  They didn't realize I couldn't hear much until I was 3 - 4.

I had a deaf teacher in 2nd grade.  He was one of the first deaf people in my province to be certified as a school teacher.  He wasn't actually my teacher, he was the teacher for the class next door.  But he would always make sure to spend time with me during recess.  He would sign with me too.  And I vaguely remember some other sign language lessons.  It wasn't *entirely* neglected but  I never really took to it I think because I had no other kids to sign with.

Looking back, it was so important to me to have a role model of a successful adult like that.  My mom still mentions him sometimes, when I get self-doubt due to my hearing loss.   Remember Mr. H.?  He went to university and became a teacher and he was completely deaf -- so I have no excuse.  A somewhat complicated sentiment but I appreciate the intent.

My best friend's little brother was profoundly deaf and so I got my sign name when I was about 5.  And yet I don't feel capital-D Deaf at all.  I live in the hearing universe especially as an adult.  Even though I feel like I'm drifting away from it as my hearing wonks out on me.

Maybe some of this discomfort with a deaf identity is because ""deaf"" was a dirty word when I was growing up. I was told not to call myself deaf.  My parents minimized it.  ""You're not deaf you're hard of hearing"".

Well I go look at my early audiograms and even as a little kid my bad ear was deaf.  110 dB threshold at the high end?  Yeah that's deaf as a post.

Being such a musical person has long conflicted with my concept of deafness too.  If I like music I can't be deaf.  I don't know how I got that idea but I hung on to it for way too long.

It has been a strange and slow realization - only much later in life starting in my 30s -- that my life-long social awkwardness is probably mostly due to my deafness.  Looking back and realizing all of the environments where I was not fully connected-in has been strange.  Like how I withdrew from my family.    Not eating meals at the table.   and spent all my time online (way back in the '90s I was online early).  All of this was driven by the hearing loss but I never realized it at the time.  

My parents were always gaslighting me, frankly.  ""You could hear me before"".  ""Selective hearing"".  They never seemed to grasp that being able to detect a sound is not the same thing as differentiating between sounds.  Family still has this problem.  Old habits die hard, I think.  My immediate relatives are the only people in my life who still do things like yell at side of my head expecting me to hear.  It sort-of-worked when I was little but it doesn't anymore.  And why was that ever okay in the first place?  

Ah life isn't so bad.  I like my hearing aids.  I often use them as the auditory equivalent of sunglasses, if I'm being honest.  The world can be overwhelmingly loud for some deaf people.  I am one of them.  That's been a strange realization too.

Hurt my ears at work. Boss made me use a broken walkie talkie. I had a bad feeling. It blew through my ear and now 4 years later I’m hoh in my left and just lost my last low/mid dBs a month ago. My right ear is  dB deaf I hear only a thin high dB range also worsened by the faulty equipment. Friends and families and work have always told me I’m just paranoid and or to just suck it up. But literally every time i leave the house i lose more hearing cause sounds hurt. Could be a bus, a horn, a phone call… most recently my grandma honked a horn at me inside the house so I lost the last of my reg dB hearing i guess. I never hurt myself at home until i moved in here. I kept myself as safe as i could but here and there i just hurt myself because i tried to be normal with people or they didn’t accommodate me and yeah. I really really miss hearing voices and understanding them. I miss watching youtube horror game vids with people all talking over each other.

I was born deaf in my right ear and mildly HoH in my left ear. It wasn't discovered till I was four years old and they did that ""raise your hand when you hear the tone"" test at the school. After a bunch of scary (to me, as a four year old) tests, they told my parents that I was born without the auditory nerve (it was 1973). My dad was in the Army, so there weren't any kinds of programs for kids like me (who moved every few years and only had access to small school districts). I didn't even go to school off base till my second junior high. (three elementary schools, two junior highs, one high school). 

My ""good"" ear continually got worse- just a little at a time. In all of my mainstreamed schooling, only three teachers had an issue with it (3rd grade teacher, 9th grade history teacher, 9th grade math teacher). But, as a teen, I was told by someone that I wasn't ""deaf enough for the Deaf community"". So I never pursued that part of life. I didn't feel comfortable calling myself ""deaf"" because of that comment till I was in my 40s (I'm 55 now). Not comfortable calling myself ""deaf"" despite literally being born deaf. 

My parents didn't give me any latitudes for being deaf or anything. My brother and I were raised the same (he's 18 months older than me). I'm the only person in our extended family to be born this way. 

I've tried to learn ASL a few times, but I'm only semi-decent with vocabulary, so I can get the gist of what's being signed but can't hold a conversation. My husband is disabled from a stroke he had at age 28. He's paralyzed on his right side and has aphasia. There's no way he would ever be able to learn ASL, he can't even remember normal things if there's more than three steps or stages. 

I've had hearing aids a few times in my life. In high school, but I overheard (ha! Pun intended!) my parents discussing how expensive it was (the Army paid for everything but the hearing device itself). So I told them I didn't like it and let them send it back before the return option ended. In my 20s, I had a Miracle Ear BiCros that connected the mic on my deaf side to the hearing aid/receiver with a wire under my hair. That was great till it broke and we couldn't afford to get it fixed. In my late 30s, I had one from Sam's Club which was fine, but it also broke and we couldn't afford to get it fixed. 

I currently have an Oticon Real 1 Minirite BiCros. I love it. It helps a lot, but it also shows how much it doesn't help in all situations. 

So, my kids grew up (they're in their 30s) with a deaf/HoH mom and a stroke-disabled father (they were 5, 3, and 20 months old when he became disabled) and their sarcasm and gallows humor show that. My youngest works in an office situation and one of the people slightly higher than her told her she ""laughed too loud, talked too loud"". She replied: ""Oh, sorry. My mom is deaf, I don't always realize how loud I am."" The woman looked at her and scoffed: ""Sure, okay!"" I asked my daughter if she wanted me to show up at her work and stand next to that woman's desk and not respond to her when she demands to know ""who are you?"" and ""Why are you standing near me?""

Hi. Born partial deaf. Dad's unwanted son, he only wanted one. Raise by loving mother, but abusive stepfather(deceased). Got bte at 5 yo, hated it. Purposely lost the bte or one time fed it to dog.lol.Had speech therapy to learn lip reading since 1st grade. Very fluent at it. Never considered myself disabled just a little more challenged than others. Picked on a lot by other hearing student, so I became a loner. Don't mind it too much since I do a ton of reading anyway. I tried to learn ASL from time to time and had taken a tech college course once and liked it very much. In my teen years, attended a camp for deaf/hoh twice. Very enjoyable time. I did not feel like I belong in hearing group nor in deaf group (not deaf enough). Gave up the bte in my 30s bc the sweat would ruin them anyway when I was working. A couple of years ago, the audiologist stated that I was transitional to severe hearing loss in both ears, I can't understand people when they're more than 4 feet away or if in semi- darkness environment. It's worse if I am tired. So, I am here to learn some of the challenges others have faced and how they have coped and hopefully be a source of encouragement at least for a while. Thank you for letting me be a part of the online community.

Didn't start talking until I was almost 4. Chronic ear infection since birth and my eustachian tubes are curled backwards. Chronically autoimmune diseases since birth. I was a Preemie. I'm a NICU baby. Reverse swallow. It was the 80s the resources that are around now  were not there when I was growing up. Raised mainstream, have read lips all my life. 

There was a special school I went to in the summer for camp that had Deaf/Hard of Hearing kids, and kids with learning disabilities my parents wanted desperately to send me to but it was 10k a semester, they would have qualified for 3k scholarship, but the other 7k would have to be paid right away and that was per a semester. My mom wouldn't have been able to pay for it because I lost my dad to lung cancer in 1996, I would have been at this particular school from 1991 - 1996.

 I just looked up the school last weekend and let a year it's now near 40k. Got my first pair of hearing at 23, and now trying to get my second pair at 39. Just had my Audiology test yesterday and by next year I will be mid-line of profoundly deaf. I have to get a CT done to see if there is anything damaged beyond bone.

I took ASL in college. My mom beats herself up everyday with the ""I wish I"" and I remind her she and my dad did the best they could. Do I struggle and pay for it now? Sure, but I don't tell her it's her fault, we honestly did not have the resources needed because my schools were so unequip or willing to help.

I'm mostly deaf on one side due to a tumor blocking my ear canal.  It's practically inoperable, and I've struggled with feeling like it's not really deafness, since I can hear fine if I hold my ear open with my hand.  

(Which definitely is weird looking to talk to someone.) 

 If I lay down on my good ear, the deafer one closes up, and I'm pretty much completely deaf.

I have a disorder called Neurofibromatosis which makes tumors grow anywhere.  In my case, the back if my head and into my ear canal.

I joined the sub hoping for a little support since it's likely to get worse.  Surgery will involve the loss of my ear and likely a BAHA and a prosthetic ear.  I don't know anyone who's been through that.

Sharing, because it seems relevant.

I was born deaf/hard of hearing/Deaf(sorry ive been going back and forth with which to use for myself for a couple months)(about moderate in right ear, profound in left), I wear hearing aids, and I'm mainstreamed with accommodations. I grew up oral and I know a very small amount of ASL. I really want to learn more though, in a big part so I can be more a part of a community that's not online(I have been in more oral deaf communities, but i want to be in other ones too).

Thankfully I've had good experiences with my school and family and the like.

Im also visually impaired and neurodivergent

I lost my hearing relatively recent. It started in 2020.


I wanna remark that- I've never had the best hearing growing up. But it was never something immediately noted by my parents. So when I finally got sick of my hearing issues near my adult age, I decided to do something about it. This would be around the general year I would start wearing NC headphones, and be quality of life greatly improved. The reason why:


Turns out, I have APD, tinnitus, mild to moderate hearing loss and most importantly hyperacusis. 

All of which were helped by wearing NC headphones, but it doesn't help in long run.

Being officially diagnosed, I got my hearing aids too. Some type of new top of the line phonak ones with the ability to bluetooth to pcs and mobiles. Pretty neat stuff.

I would try and get some answers onto *why* this was happening. After sticking my head into a big whirly tube, I got my results back and the doctors are as perplexed as I am, not finding anything. They then take my blood and I get a report a couple weeks later.


This is the odd part, they still didnt find anything. However, they did say that it might be the cause of a rare gene, hence why I have some other symptoms, and that I would be required to go all the way to London to get the proper medical assistance to deal with it.


So... now I'm here. I've learnt asl and have participated heavily in the deaf community and I've shared plenty. But yet despite this I can feel like I'm ""not deaf"" enough in contrast to other people. I feel like it's the more appropriate title, because if I didnt know you and you tried speaking to me- there is a very small chance of me understanding you.


So anyway, hope this was insightful in anyway possible.

Not understanding spoken word is frustrating enough, that I know.

SSD and not knowing where sound is coming from is frustrating and dangerous.

I have Ménière’s so sometimes I am more deaf than other times.

I’m more secure in my identity now. And that was BECAUSE I had wonderful people who welcomed me with open arms.
And I continue to do the same for others!
Once you find the people who accept you, don’t let them go. Even if they’re hearing interpreters, even if they’re ASL students. 
For context, I was mainstreamed in school and learned ASL at 11 years old. I had a hearing aid and nothing in the other ear. As I got older I chose to get a cochlear implant. 
I now work at a Deaf non profit.

One thing I see over and over again is the people who dismiss your deafness is often struggling with their own deaf identity.
And this happens a lot in the deaf community unfortunately. 

Those comments are often trying to validate their own experiences by invalidating someone else’s.

I work as an ASL teacher and Deaf mentor now, at a deaf non profit. I say this to emphasize that people STILL discredit my identity by the signs I use, or my accent. It will always happen unfortunately.

Often the most “Big D Deaf” people I know don’t have deaf families or generational ties.
I’ve learned that Deafness isn’t about preserving a language or a culture by aggressively gatekeeping. It’s about coming together as a community. And possibly making things better for the next generation of Deaf kids and youth.

Are there some Big D assholes out there? Absolutely. 

But keep remembering the struggles you face, those validate you. Your lived experiences validate you. Not the voice of a stranger or even a person you know.
It’s great to find friends who share experiences, finding community is powerful for your healing.

Hell yeah! Everyone's experience is individual and different. If we spend all our time wondering if we're ""deaf enough,"" we'll miss out on the ability to make connections and better ourselves and/communities. 

I was born hard of hearing, my parents were supportive and learned some ASL to ease communication with me; however, they did fall for a lot of culturally audist ideas. I don't hold what they did in the past against them; they've more than made up for it in recent years. I went to a weird school(hippy, Amish, cult school), but in school, I had a 504 plan to help accommodate my hearing loss, and my teachers were generally pretty great about it. I was actually able to have some surgery to improve my hearing and other health issues during my freshman year of high school. However, I've still got much less hearing and am losing my hearing a lot faster than most of my peers. In college, I am now studying speech pathology and audiology because of my own experience with SLPs and audiologists, in the hopes of being able to help others like myself one day.

Hi friends! Partially deaf (that blasted speech banana) here! Raised by a hearing family, taught to finger spell at a young age but not for access, just because my mom thought it was cool 😅 Diagnosed with significant loss in my mid 30s. Have tried amplifiers but everything is SO NOISY. I haven’t saved enough for proper HAs yet, though I do need them in both ears. And of course insurance is garbage and won’t pay for them. 
Claiming deaf is hard for me too because I have friends that are “more deaf” or have more significant loss than I do and I look at them as “really deaf” which makes me only kinda deaf? HOH is something I lean to often but younger folks don’t always understand what I mean when I say that. I’m still able to communicate orally though my loss is progressive due to chronic illness so that may get worse. I’m learning ASL mostly by watching Tik tok videos of CODAS and deaf teachers. I try to immerse myself in it often so I can learn and retain it. 
Most people can’t tell because I grew up hearing and my speech shows it, and that plus lip reading has gotten me by under the radar for decades. My family didn’t realize I was HOH so there’s a lot of like jokes about me being too loud or too noisy, shutting the door “too hard” and other stuff I don’t really get!!

Short story

Born hard of hearing, little hearing loss. Became deaf in one ear now, after one ear was a few db after total deafness. I will go deaf in my other ear as well. I am already at 86 db. Only one in the family.

Raised with speech, no sign language at home. But learned it at school myself, by watching the interpreter, to someone in the class who was deaf. Became quite good and still remember it just as well. I use it in meetings with deaf or hard of hearing people/big groups, but otherwise I prefer to speak. Didn't learn to speak before I was 4 years old. But I learned to walk when I was 9 to 11 months old🏃‍♀️

Good family relationships and upbringing. Was treated like any other child, and I have no particular thoughts about it. Went to regular school. I managed to handle it, but got extremely tired. Went to a school for the hearing impaired (high school), and I made more friends than I ever made during elementary school/youth school. Better grades, without putting much work into it.

I’m still struggling with this.  I lost my hearing on one side in a matter of hours 18 months ago.  Zero word recognition and complete loss. My other side is mild loss.  I’m in my 40s so it’s such a weird feeling to suddenly not hear.  I don’t really sign.  My family still struggles to remember.  In the right environment I almost function as hearing.  But put me in public or any background noise or another room and I’m more deaf than HOH. Going voice off feels so fake. Learning sign language feels like cosplaying still.  But I can’t hear!  I’m getting a cochlear implant soon so maybe that will help with function some.  But noise in general hits different now so I’m worried the cochlear will be something else that hurts.

I still don't have a good understanding of my hearing loss. I've been HoH since I was young, but my parents never got me proper care to identify. I also ruptured my ear drum at the age of 5, but never received medical attention to see what the effects were. My family has a history of hearing impairment so I really don't know what I was born with vs what developed. I do recall as a child getting a hearing test at school and the technician looking very concerned when I didn't say I could hear so I lied. I had been told if I didn't do well that I wouldn't get into the gifted program. There's no way that's true so I'm guessing my parents just didn't want to deal with anything.

Now that I'm 31 I can tell my hearing is getting even worse. I hear some pitches and sounds, but never everything. I spend my time guessing at what people say to me. I am very skilled at lip reading but struggle when I can't see people's faces. I'm also extremely sensitive to sound. I feel constantly overstimulated. I tend to hear low, mechanical type sounds better than anything so it becomes overwhelming. Plus trying to interpret what people are saying gets absolutely exhausting by the end of the day. I'm so tired. This has all been made worse by having kids and working in a cubicle farm. 

I've been trying to get help. I live in FL where the majority of people are retirees on Medicare. Medicare covers hearing aids so all the offices I've found are like chop shops putting out hearing aids at the highest possible cost to insurance. It feels like a scam I can't escape. My insurance doesn't cover anything hearing related and I've received quotes around $8k which I can't afford. I've been too scared to try alternatives without going through a doctor's office because I worry I'll somehow mess my hearing up worse. I've also had so many other health concerns to deal with due to growing up completely void of proper care. So my hearing gets pushed to the back because I can hear ""just enough"".
I tell people in my daily life that I'm HoH but I don't feel like anyone really takes it seriously since I seem to get by ok

1nip6ej,deaf,My mom (53) is slowly becoming completely deaf and I don’t know what to do,"Hi, I’m an 18 yo girl with a mom, as the title says, that’s becoming completely deaf. Since I can remember she had problems to hear people, and some years ago she became completely deaf from an ear. The other one is also slowly abandoning her. Today we had dinner together and it was really frustrating to see her not understanding what I was saying, talking so loud and making so much noise with her mouth (for context, I have diagnosed OCD so these kind of things really make me nervous). Idk, I feel a mix of anger cause she doesn’t wanna see a doctor for it, anger because of the noise she makes, and deep sadness cause I see her getting more and more detached from the reality every day. Please, if someone is going or has been through something similar, leave some suggestions. I feel devastated by this situation. Every day is a battle not to explode to her cause I understand she doesn’t do it on purpose. Plus seeing your mother like this, even if we never had a good relationship, isn’t the happiest of experiences. I don’t even have someone to talk to and at least vent, cause nobody of my friends has similar experiences and they always seem not to understand when I tell my mom is becoming deaf.

You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. Your mom seems like a dehydrated horse but nonetheless, you can't make her seek treatment. 


Also, you seem preoccupied with fixing your mom. You need to consider that even if she looked into hearing aids, she might not get shit for results with them, depending on the nature of her hearing loss. Even if she got spectacular results, is wouldn't be a cure.  


Have your politely told your mom that she's speaking much louder than necessary? You seem to know this isn't intentional for her. 


From your comment, it sounds like your mom is stubborn and in denial. You can't really do anything about that. 


Always be sure you're doing what you can to mitigate the communication barrier. If your mom won't accept that she needs to hold her end, then the only thing you can do is add distance.  I did that with my parents, but I'm the deaf one in my case.

Are y'all willing to learn your country's sign language?  

If yes, sign language + earplugs sounds like it could be a winning combo.  Some of my fellow ASL students habitually wear earplugs out... city is noisy and we don't need our voices, so it works well.

I suddenly went deaf in my left ear at 34. I got hearing aids and it made a world of difference. Audiologists are not ENT doctors and don't have the same ""doctor"" vibe. Maybe she'd be willing to try hearing aids, especially if her mother has them too. I would try those if you can swing it. She might even be able to try loaners before she has to pony up and get the real ones.

A person who's suddenly gone deaf doesn't know that her voice is too loud for hearing people to handle.  I've worn hearing aids since my early 30s and I'm 63 now.",2025-09-16 18:14:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nip6ej/my_mom_53_is_slowly_becoming_completely_deaf_and/
1niirww,deaf,Would You Prefer Your Kid To Be Deaf,"\[ANSWERED, thanks for the replies. I‘ve read every single one of them\]  
  
This youtube video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgtdVWEBXOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgtdVWEBXOM) ) by TedED asks the question “Should we genetically modify a baby to be deaf if both parents want it?”. They give the following arguments.

1. Deafness is simply different and not an outright bad thing. For example they say deaf people can feel music with vibrations in ways people without deafness can’t.
2. Seeing deafness as a bad thing and thus refusing to give genes to a baby is an attitude that is harmful and disrespectful that sees the lives of deaf people is less worth living.
3. Parents with deafness can better understand their deaf kids and these deaf kids can be a part of the deaf culture better. Thus forming stronger bonds than if the baby was not deaf.

The video is not exactly one-sided as it suggests maybe the best solution is to leave everything to chance.

But the comment section is full of people thinking that making a baby deaf is simply wrong because it deprives kids of essential sensations. Obviously the comment section is full of people that aren’t deaf and I think I’d ask deaf people what they think, for a better argument that isn’t one-sided.

What do you think?

Edit: I meant do you think these statements are false or correct?

Thanks for your inputs. I’ll use it to shape my thoughts

I don’t have any kids, but I wouldn’t wish one way or the other for them. All I’d want is for them to grow up in a healthy, happy home that celebrates them for every aspect of who they are. 

Deafness isn’t even that rare or different. People just don’t pursue a diagnosis for it often. Just like people with glasses aren’t different. They just fall into the percentage of the population who wear glasses.

As a deaf person,  I would rather leave it to chance.  Both hearing or deaf kids are both a blessing to have. I'm not a fan of genetic editing or whatever. It feels unethical for more than one reason, ya know? Like its a slippery slope that leads to things like nazism.

I'm Deaf, from a Deaf family... my family has various genetic deafness things going on after many generations and after some testing I was told any biological children of mine would have something like an 83% chance of being born profoundly deaf, smaller percentage of still not having ""normal"" hearing, but if I did decide to have children I wouldn't care if they were hearing or deaf, I wouldn't willingly change them to make them deaf... the world is not designed for deaf people and there's no real justification for me to actually make their life harder than it needed to be? If they were born deaf then that's a different story. Two of my siblings have had children, I have 4 nieces and only one of them is deaf, and nobody is bothered that most of the are hearing

[deleted]

i will be SO excited if my baby is deaf too, BUT i would never change it purposefully

Why not just adopt a Deaf child? There's plenty of children who need loving homes?. 

Personally, I think a baby is a blessing, and I'd be happy to be a mom. Ethier way, my kid will be loved. doesn’t matter if my kid is hearing or Deaf.

100% would not willingly have a deaf child. The world isn’t designed for deaf people and I wouldn’t sign another person up for my struggles if offered a choice.

Using ""just different"" is a bit cringe. It would have no downsides which isn't the case at all with deafness. It has objectively more disadvantages than normal hearing. ""It isn't so bad"" only because there are accommodations, but not for everything. Try being deaf(or disabled in general) in third world countries. Deaf education is a global issue, even in first world countries. The person in video probably sounds a bit sheltered. I'm really grateful to have accommodations at least in my country.

What do you mean hearing people can't feel music in ways deaf people can? That's simply false. Infact, hearing people can feel all things deaf people feel, vibrations in this context. Disabled means lack the ability or have weakened part of it. Out of all disadvantages of being deaf, you had to pick music an unimportant and trivial issue until the near end of video when it finally mentioned discrimination and other disadvantages.

Robert's logic is not sound. Why would the parents want a child to have SAME deprivations they have? CODAs can still enable Deaf culture in their lives. Also it would be very beneficial for hearing parents to have hearing children. Over 90% of deaf children have hearing parents and majority of the hearing parents don't sign or barely sign at all. Dinner table syndrome is the utmost common experience. So in this case, the deaf child will have SAME disadvantages or deprivations as the deaf parents so the deaf child's life won't be better, but the same. I just know there isn't a single person who want their child to have Usher syndrome. I highly doubt any person with Down syndrome want their child to have Down syndrome as well.

1. My life would be very different if I was born hearing and able to speak. Better, even.

2. I got a lot of bad genes from my parents and I'm the only Deaf(and legally blind recently) in my family. Would that mean I disrespect others for not wanting to pass on bad genes to my kid if I ever have one? It sounds kinda unhinged if you ask me.

3. Typically, yes. Not always though. CODAs are entirely capable of having a strong relationship with their deaf parents. There's not really a correlation to being hearing and have better relationship if their parents are hearing. Lotta hearing children abandoned their hearing parents for different reasons.

Born profoundly Deaf ASL user here and I DO think it's wrong to genetically modify an embryo to become deaf. That's going backward.

That sounds like child abuse to genetically modify a baby to be deaf ... that's weird af. Why would you modify your baby generally? 

Life is harder as someone that is deaf that works full-time even with modern technology. If it as hard as the life I would have lived before ADA, no, but it is different. People assume deaf means yelling at me, speaking to me as if I'm dumb, and nobody truly accommodates deafness. You accommodate yourself for others. That's sad when you think about it ... but I wouldn't change it. My deafness made be stronger and I've been deaf since I was a kid, but it made it easier for me to be alone with my thoughts and bullying wasn't as bad because half the time I couldn't hear them. 

I would say you are deprived in a way, but I wouldn't say of essential sensations. You are deprived of someone actually seeing you vs seeing your deafness. I have a personality like everyone else and sometimes that is ignored because to some I am deaf first ... I'm actually oral, so that was the interesting part. Once someone is aware, they sometimes forget I am a person outside of being deaf.

No, I would not. Deafness is absolutely a disability and I wouldn’t wish the struggles I've had in my time on my kid.

The issue isn't the modification it's how obsessed people are with having biological kids. There are so many kids out there who need good homes why make another one instead of giving your love to an existing person who needs it? I'd adopt a deaf kid over a hearing one because I'd like them to share my culture and I think a Deaf parent/family would provide for them better than a hearing one. Why isn't this encouraged more for people who specifically want deaf kids? (Or kids with any specific characteristic)

I wouldn’t genetically modify them, but I would probably hope that they’d be deaf!

honestly i wouldn’t wish deafness on another but it’s not something that has to be totally avoided. it’s ironic how no one would really want to wish to deprive their kid or another but in not wanting that, it’s deemed eugenics or that disabled people are less than others. this is a ‘i like pancakes.’ ‘oh so you don’t like waffles?’ it’s possible for a deaf or disabled person to thrive but you’d have to work harder than others. in a world that doesn’t always provide accommodations, it’s not fun. it’s a disability, some people find a community and i’m so happy for them but sometimes not always

I'd prefer my kiddo to be happy and healthy, with all ten fingers and all ten toes!

I don’t agree with genetically modifying babies. If both parents are deaf, I understand wanting a deaf child, but it just feels wrong to tamper with how the baby develops. It feels abusive, personally. 

The child can still grow up learning Sign and being part of Deaf culture through their parents, even if they’re CODA. They may themselves end up being HoH or deaf down the line anyway through external circumstances and they’ll be better prepared than most.

I would love my child regardless, there's nothing wrong with deafness, You seem to imply that we should be offended in some manner, if you are hearing, how can you be offended on our behalf?

No. I’d prefer if my son wasn’t deaf. 

Luckily he has ci and can therefore perceive sound to a degree where it makes him “hearing”

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Of course it’s bad. You should never remove something so intrinsically valuable to being human. I feel bad for any kid growing up deaf because their parents made them that way. I guess I should just chop off your legs too while I’m at it lol.

I think ""engineering""your baby in general is wrong, Deaf hearing, tall short, blonde hair brown, etc. doesn't matter the details. If you cant love a baby for how they come naturally maybe you should reconsider having children. Or if its that big of deal maybe adopt a Deaf child who needs a family. I think it can start stuff like aborting girls like some places used to. With really severe disabilities that result in a short life of horrible physical suffering if the baby even survives, I think its called Tay Sachs? Stuff like that is a little different. But playing with hearing can result in the opposite. There's way more hearing families that want hearing babies and most of us Deafies are born to hearing families. My family is soooo amazing and supportive but thats rare. Theres much fewer Deaf couples wanting Deaf babies so I feel like its result in engineering no more DHH more than the opposite. CODAs learn ASL as a first language fine even if they can hear. I dunno this whole idea seems like a scary slippery slope IMO ♡

Even if I'm fully capable of using sign language, have a CI, have the inheritance to afford the best hearing aids; etc, I would be livid if I found out my parents chose it for me. Yes, we have our deaf community, but there are still burdens that come along with a disability, even if we don't want to admit it, that make life harder than it needs to be. Why anyone would wish it upon their child is beyond me; I think it's selfish.

Being deaf is a neverending source of frustration for me; it makes everything more difficult. I would never wish that on my kids.

Of course not, kind of a silly question to ask.

Not up for eugenics on either side of the spectrum - so I’m not going to genetically modify a child lmao but also sure I would prefer my kid to be deaf and why is that controversial?

Culturally Deaf here. I don't know enough about PGD to say what I would do, but I can say that if I was given the opportunity to choose from a hearing egg or a deaf egg, I would choose the deaf egg.

I don't think it is my place to make that decision for others. I can imagine if I went up to \[any minority race or ethnic group\] people and said they should choose a \[any different race or ethnicity\] baby, they would be quite upset with me for suggesting it.

1niij13,deaf,Application for reasonable adjustment at work (UK),"I’m hearing impaired and work for the library service over a number of different sites throughout the local authority area. Usually this is not an issue as I work with other staff who can help when I have difficulty with customers who, for example, have face coverings for medical or religious reasons (I partially rely on lip reading) or the libraries that I am asked to sole staff are really quiet and I can hear ok with my hearing aids.

However, one library I am asked to work at is in a shared environment with a community centre which is a very noisy and busy environment with a café and a Dr’s and our reception desk is shared with the centre staff who speak loudly all the time, and I really struggle. I’ve repeatedly asked to not sole staff it (I’m fine here with another member of staff to support me when I have difficulty hearing people) but I am rota’d to staff the library here on my own at least once a fortnight, if not more often.

 I think that need to make an formal application to my manager for a reasonable adjustment ie a formal process which will mean that I do not have to sole staff that library. Has anyone gone about making a similar request in their workplace, especially in a local authority? I'm just getting stonewalled at the moment by everyone, including UNISON, it's really frustrating.

As a last resort, you could go for the safeguarding card. Risk to yourself / the public if something happens. 

However, I would get advice from the union first. If you're not happy with UNISON, there are other unions you can join, or ask on reddit r/legaladviceuk or a UK-based HR subreddit.   
  
You don't want to argue yourself out of a job or be considered a troublemaker by management. 

So I would phrase your communication with your line manager as concern for safety and wanting to be positive and proactive in solving the problem.  Try to think of a solution that causes them minimal bother (while also satisfying you.)",2025-09-16 14:08:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1niij13/application_for_reasonable_adjustment_at_work_uk/

I wear cochlear implants too and I always select no on the application but I do tell them about my deafness after I get hired

I always say I’m not disabled. They can’t fire me once I’m hired considering my hearing loss adds no burden to hiring me

Typically the hiring manager is never supposed to see that information. They say it's totally anonymized so they only get statistics. 


However I'm not comfortable filling out demographic details either. You just never know.

I just decline to answer all demographic questions

I think that’s been on job applications in the US for decades. It’s required data collection. I usually check the box. It’s not supposed to go against you and they are not allowed to ask what the disability is.

1nibu0d,deaf,How to get involved in school when deaf?,"So I am currently attending a hearing university and I have hard time coming out ways to get involved in community. I have no desire to join clubs because I feel like it won’t be much fun to me if I cannot get along with club members well (even with interpreters). I tried to make friends with my classmates but it is hard for me to have a quality conversation with my classmates after class without interpreters (I suspect even with interpreters, it will still be difficult to get to know them on personal level).

[댓글]
Pick a classmate that you want to hang out with and ask. The first few times may not work, but it will help you understand what may work. Are you oral at all? With a combo of an app to help you understand what the person is saying plus a writing app if you aren't oral. Also, what about students in the accessibility department ... are any of them your vibe? That may be a good start.

I had a lot of luck with the international students when I was in uni. A lot more patience all around, more willingness to use accommodations like writing and gestures, and more likely to do activities that didn’t involve a lot of conversation, like movie night (in dorm, so we would have captions of course). 

One thing that I did was go to events even if I didn’t really feel like it. Chances are, there will be extroverts there on the prowl to adopt any introverts, so you can at least vet some of those for potential. 

In my experience, classmates aren’t the best bet for developing friendships. They’re more interested in chatting during class, which I couldn’t really participate in, and then outside of class they just wanted to talk about the class—which wasn’t really interesting to me.",2025-09-16 08:29:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nibu0d/how_to_get_involved_in_school_when_deaf/

Have you already tried the native Live Captions in System Settings &gt; Accessibility? If your Mac is on an apple silicon chip, that is. If Intel, I'm not sure about other non-native apps.

MacOS has live captioning built in. Or if you can feed audio through Google Chrome browser, that also has live captioning built in. Alternatively you can get the Ava app (free and paid).

i had some luck with otter AI

For in person meetings, you could also try just opening an empty Zoom or Google Meet meeting by yourself and using those live captions.

Idk for sure, but could you possibly use your mobile phone? Some have built in live captioning that you could use for in person meetings.

I have created [clyo.app](https://clyo.app) for this. You can live transcribe using it and use it for summarization etc.",2025-09-15 23:31:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ni1plf/are_there_literally_any_live_transcription_apps/

1ng6jjb,deaf,Insecure of my accent.,"I (25F) work in a shop in my hometown where I had a few customers asked me where I was from since they never heard of my accent. For context, I am from Newcastle, England so people would expect a Geordie accent. One said I sound Welsh , while the other said I sound Irish. It was kinda awkward when I mentioned that I'm actually from here and one commented that I don't sounds like I come from here (which is low-key hurtful). I had to explain that I'm deaf (which I feel like I don't need to own them an explanation) and they apologised profusely about it which made the whole conversation just awkward and it made me feel insecure on the way I speak to other people.

I had years of speech therapy since the beginning of primary school and people had no problems understanding me. In fact, some people are quite shocked that I'm actually deaf just from my speech alone. 

I know feeling insecure about my accent may sounds a bit silly and that some people are oblivious about my journey and disability but I don't know why it got to me. I feel like that question shouldn't be asked in case they upset anyone.

I wonder if any of you had that experience before. If you do, how would you deal with that?

EDIT: I have cochlear implants

It’s called deaf speak- I’m HOH/single side Deaf too and my Dr explained I do have it too.

I got a thick Boston accent somehow, my parents from Alabama and Florida. I’ve lived in NY/NYC my whole life and only been to Boston 4-5 times. I think it’s funny, people will ask me “You from Boston?” And tell them “No, I just watched “Good Will Hunting” a bit too many times in my formative years.”

We all deaf have a accent and not much u can do about it

I switch on subtitles on Teams at work, I find it hilarious how the Teams autocraptions get really confused by my deaf accent even though I am oral deaf!

Your accent goes along with everything that is unique to you. That what makes you unique. Embrace it because not a lot of people are lucky to stand out like we do.

Don't worry too much about the accent. We are talented at picking up accents from those whom we spend a great deal of time with without even realizing it. It could be that your speech teacher or someone currently in your life has an accent that resembles Welsh/Irish that you may have picked up on and began using it unconsciously. We can take pride in the fact that we are able to speak very well regardless of whether we are hoh/deaf, its an accomplishment that very few people can claim with honor! You know your origins and where you are from and that is all that really matters.😊

I get the same. Sometimes people ask me if I have a tongue piercing.

i too am a deaf geordie and i literally always get told I’ve got a hybrid scottish and welsh accent, i suppose there’s not really anything we can do about it other than laugh it off like last time i got asked the same question at work they said “Edinburgh aye?” and i said nope, pointed at my hearing aids and when he got awkward and apologised I just giggled and said your alright pal, I would just try not to take it personally cause at the end of the day the way you speak is the way you speak and you’ve come a long way to get to wherever you are now :)

Being Geordie is in your soul, not your accent.

I'm from edinburgh. i travel a lot. people all say i dont sound scottish, or assume im english.
i get ya. its annoying.

I think over time you just get used to it, honestly. Although my hearing loss is on the mild/moderate side, I also have nerve issues in my face, so I have a fairly strong ""accent"" despite years of speech therapy as a kid. The trick is just... Finding people who don't care about it. I used to be *super* insecure about it, mainly when I was dating a really shitty ex who would always point out my ""accent"" and my volume control issues. But now I have a really great group of people around me who simply don't care at all about it, and my confidence has gone sky-high. If someone is being a dick to you, you just kinda have to say ""fuck em"" and not give them a second thought. Easier said than done, but that's really all there is to it in my experience.

Try having a Yorkshire/Canadian/Australian mix (I've spent 10-15 years in each place).

It apparently comes out sounding Irish!!

I was born hearing, spoke fluently with no accent, but was slowly deafened over \~30 years and for the last \~15 years I've had random people ask me where my accent is from. I've had Irish, I've had French, I've had Boston guesses. I'm Canadian, in southern Ontario where we all sound like the ""neutral"" north american accent.  One of my bosses even asked me this as I was meeting him for the first time, he was way more embarrassed than I was. I always tell people there is no need to be embarrassed, I don't give a sh\*t if I sound deaf.  Honestly, what reason is there to be embarrassed about it?  

So it just is what it is, no need to feel bad. I get that it might seem like a worse thing when you have been put through speech therapy as a child, they gave that mindset that it matters more than it does.   ...Irish French and Boston...people obviously have their own quirks in perception! It's not about you.

I experience the same thing as an American. I was raised in about the middle of the country, in theory I should have the accent you hear in any American movie or show, instead I sound like I have a New York accent. Most people don’t realize it’s my hearing loss.

Hmm I’m hard of hearing left and dB deaf in my right I wonder when I lose those last high dBs how long it’ll take to develop a speech or forget sounds. Its been 4ish years losing my hearing and I low key already think I’ve certain dB ranges and now that ai cant hear low/mid at all…i dunno.

People have asked what country im from before, someone thought i was Danish (im American). Its just part of who you are like your eye color. Sometimes its fun to mess with people!

I’ve been told that I have no discernible accent, that I have “newscaster’s voice”. Both of my parents were small town farm kids from Wisconsin. I was an Army brat and lived in different places (including Alaska). 

I do live in Wisconsin now, but despite this being the longest I’ve lived in one place ever, I don’t have the typical Wisconsin/Illinois accent. 

I feel like my voice is deeper than a typical woman’s voice and I’m kinda self-conscious about that, but not always.

I just find it amusing when people get a puzzled look on their face and try to figure out my accent. To me it should be pretty obvious, but apparently it’s not for everyone.

American born with family from Shrewsbury... So I have a mix of a Midwestern American, English and deaf accent. It's not uncommon for me to go from a solid American accent to a solid English accent and butcher some word in the middle with a deaf accent. There's not a single state I've been to in which I've not been asked ""where are you from?"" 🤣 I'll always give them a deadpanned answer ""America"" with a straight face just to see what kind of responses I'll get. Sometimes they'll fish for more info, sometimes they get super awkward, sometimes it makes for some of the best chats you'll ever have with strangers you'll never see again. 
I used to be so offended by being asked that... Then I started to have fun with it by getting them to try guessing. Some of the responses are pretty comical. 
If you can... Embrace it. It's a signature, it's a fingerprint... It's uniquely you. Don't lose that. 🫶🏼

Your deaf journey has been much longer than mine so please take my comments for as much or as little as you think they're worth.  I'm late deafened and would like to provide a possible hearing person's perspective.  So, here goes:  Accents are cool.  They provide what we think is a safe way to ask questions and show interest in someone else.  If someone is trying to place your accent, it means that your verbal skills are pretty darned good. 

You don't owe anyone an explanation.  They aren't at fault if they don't know you're deaf.  We just all need to give each other some grace. 

Here's my approach. I find a way to let people know I'm deaf.  I don't apologize.  It's just a fact.  Giving them this information helps nice people reframe their thinking about how to communicate with me.  They appreciate it and almost always move forward in the discussion in a positive way.

It would be great if people learned to replace ""I'm sorry "" with ""That's interesting"".  When I  am comfortable with my deafness, I'm in a place to help others be comfortable with me.  When I'm self conscious, people pick up that they've caused me discomfort.  They become self conscious and may say the most awkward, wrong thing.  We're all human.  


One approach is to help them label your accent as the impressive victory it is and then close the topic by moving on to a more comfortable one.  Here's an option that you could edit until it works for you: ""oh, I'm deaf.  It took me years of hard work to learn to speak this well.  Thanks for noticing. (Now prevent the awkward ""I'm sorry "" by giving them something else to talk about). ""What brings you here today?"" Or ""That's a cute haircut.  Who does your hair?"".  Or whatever question you want to ask to change the topic get to know them better.

You should be so proud of your voice. As a mother who is raising a deaf child I know how hard y’all have to practice on oral language. Other people are blessed to hear your voice and that you are communicating orally. Your accent is a small part of who you are in the scheme of things.",2025-09-13 19:31:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ng6jjb/insecure_of_my_accent/
1nfw4n1,deaf,SSD Child &amp; Deaf community,"I recently gave birth to a perfect little girl who was born without a cochlear nerve on the left. She is single side deaf.

We are trying to do all things in our power to support her and enable her to acquire as much language as possible. This currently includes early intervention, auditory verbal therapy and learning some basic signs (we also did this with our first child.) We are also talking about learning ASL.

I am curious about opinions and ask with the utmost respect - should I be trying to immerse myself in order to expose my daughter to deaf culture to enable her to identify with this later in life? (I.E. enroll in Deaf school, attend events and introducing her to arts and literature created by/for the community)

 There is such a powerful sense of community and also strong feelings, so much so that I feel a bit intimidated as someone who is hearing with little experience. I do not want to be poorly received in my effort to educate myself, but also am thinking it’s important to expose my daughter so she has the access and is familiar with the community later on in life. Or is this something she can just explore on her own - like maybe I shouldn’t feel the need to force it or involve myself.

Please be kind. Just a parent trying to do her best. Thank you so much in advance for your responses!

My parents avoided everything you mentioned and I feel like they cheated me. I think immersion into deaf culture and ASL for your entire family starting now would be helpful. There's lots of hearing parents in your shoes, and if I could go back and tell my folks to get me involved as a child, I would. Your child will deal with the hearing world everywhere else, so having deaf friends would likely make their life much better and less isolating. You have to get involved, too, though.

Do everything - immerse yourself; learn Sign; enrol your child in a d / Deaf school - but also, please do consult with specialists and those within the Community. They will know best and how to help you….

I am technically SSD (severe to profound in one ear, mild to moderate in the other). I use HAs for both ears now, but when I was younger only used one.

My family has Deaf and hearing members, so before I was diagnosed (age 3) I got ALL the language! I was mainstreamed after kindergarten and kind of managed to get through 1st through 12th that way. No interpreters. 

My deafness is progressive, so starting with community college I realized I just couldn’t function without ASL interpreters and other accommodations. While I was successful in school until that point, I was severely depressed because it was so hard, so exhausting, and I had next to no energy to do anything after school every day. Listening fatigue is brutal. 

Because i grew up signing, with occasional interpreter access for special events or the Deaf events we went to, I didn’t have a learning curve for ASL. Many people who choose to have an interpreter face a steep learning curve because, yes, it’s visually the most accessible… but if you don’t already have a language foundation, it’s a lot of work! (Hats off to all of you who learned ASL later on. Champ!) Live/CART captioning is an option, too, but the eye fatigue gets pretty bad, switching constantly between speaker, lecture slides, and captions. Interpreters can stand where I still see my professors and slide content all in one place, and help reduce the amount of looking around I need to do in order to get context.

I was a good student in K-12. But, with interpreters, I have a 3.98 GPA. I’m not exhausted like I used to be. The listening fatigue and depression of being isolated and always feeling confused and left out is genuinely so bad that I didn’t have a social life for years, and couldn’t do basic tasks for myself. 

After I started receiving interpreting accommodations in classes and working in a singing environment… I have enough energy to go hang out with my hearing friends (who are lovely and accommodating) for hours! I can spend time with my deaf and signing friends for longer! I am the most joyful and happy I have ever been in my life. I get both. (: 

I was offered everything that was available, not just a subset of options. Being able to have those skills, and then being able to CHOOSE? I can’t recommend it enough. Give your kiddo everything you possibly, feasibly can. I’m a big fan of both in every option—English or ASL? Both! 

Please feel free to DM me if you have any questions. I have personal, lived experience—and I do research on these topics. I would be happy to send some additional resources your way or answer questions. There are some great programs that help families learn ASL together and they can be quite fun.

Congratulations on the new baby!

\&gt; Please be kind. Just a parent trying to do her best. 

You absolutely are, and you're definitely diving head first into this. No one could expect more from a new parent.

You seem to be more aware of the d/Deaf world than most hearing parents and that's good. You see the value in using sign language and early language acquisition.  I'm post-lingually deaf and only got to learn ASL as a young adult, I'll never be as fluent as I would like, but learning it was one of the best choices I made back then.

I was born hearing and lost my hearing as a teen and young adult, and for a time I had pretty good hearing in my ""good"" ear and absolutely nothing in my left.  So I have first hand experience about single sided deafness. I can tell you with certainty that being single sided deaf does not affect ones quality of life nearly as much as being hard of hearing or deaf on both sides. It also far more common that you may be aware.

Most people with single sided deafness do not identify as deaf, and don't often learn ASL or anything about deaf culture. Your child will likely need some accommodation in school, but most of that will just take the form of awareness and consideration that they can't hear on that side, and can't tell what direction sound is coming from.

Beyond giving your child access to language (ASL) and being aware that a diverse and broad community of deaf people exist, you can let your child explore on her own. Single sided deafness does not really separate people from the hearing world the same way so there's no telling how her own personal identity will form. That being said whenever more hearing people are aware we exist and value the diversity we bring to the world, that's a very good thing.

Be sure to check out r/monohearing and r/podc and please come back and ask more questions if you have them.  It's very clear that you've given a lot of thought and care to your post and I want to assure you that your asking is fine, you're not being offensive or annoying :)

Edit to add: As I mentioned there are lots of single sided deaf people out there, including famous people such as Late Show host Stephen Colbert.

I’m a hearing mum of a deaf 13 year old boy. We are in Australia.

Sometimes I get hearing parents of deaf babies contact me for support and advice.

Short version: yes you should immerse in the deaf community and learn sign language.

The longer version is, it can be difficult to do so when you have no connection to the deaf community, a newborn who will have more allied health appointments than other newborns, and sign language is a whole complete language and learning an entirely new language is not easy and takes years to become proficient.

But it’s not all or nothing. Take small steps to learn about the deaf community, culture and language.

I was born without a cochlear nerve in my right ear. They didn’t even know till I was in Head Start (the “raise your hand when you hear the tone” test). I was mainstreamed throughout the entirety of my schooling. My dad was in the Army and there weren’t programs for kids like me in the 70s (moving every 3 to 4 years). 

The one thing that I wish we had done was learn sign language, properly. I’m 55 now and it would have been so much better to have had that kind of thing. I’ll never be fluent, but I didn’t expect it to be so hard to learn (for me, I struggle with remembering all of the things I learned). 

So as a former SSD child and current deaf/HoH gramma, you’re already doing great.

I was born without a fully developed cochlear nerve and grew up SSD! I will try to come back and add more complete thoughts later, but the number one thing I would say is to learn and teach her ASL from infancy. 


I learned as a teenager, and then lost most of the hearing in my good ear due to disease last year- knowing ASL already allowed me to stay in college and quickly shift many aspects of my life when I became Deaf after being SSD. 

Even using ASL and getting involved with the Deaf community before losing the rest of my hearing was so positive for me, as someone with SSD because it was the only area I didn’t have to work overtime to hear and communicate. So I highly recommend that involvement and language!

She’ll be just fine, some small adjustments will make her life easier but the fact that you’re asking says you will do great getting her everything she needs :) 

P.s I recommend:

1. Use captions on tv and movies
2. Request seating for her in the very front far left of a classroom (this allows all sound to travel toward her good ear, as in SSD much sound is lost by it wrapping around the head) 
3. Provide her ear protection at concerts and loud venues 
4. Most little ones don’t tolerate them well, and I for one can attest they are overwhelming, but there is a type of hearing aid called a CROS hearing aid that allows sound from the deaf side to go into a device that lets it be heard on the good side without having to make the good side louder than normal. These are often overlooked because SSD kids learn language well, but I got them as a teen and found them very helpful. If they are distressing or very uncomfy, I would never force the using of hearing devices though.

1nfrb8d,deaf,Survived Abusive deaf school,"I attended a UK oral deaf school during the 1980s. It was so dogmatically anti-sign language that I saw teachers yelling at deaf children to stop signing.

We also had to pretend to be hearing all the time and several other kids who were not as deaf as I was acted like they were better than me. I learned to be ashamed of my deafness in my deaf school.

I also saw kids and a minority of staff being abusive to each other (verbally, emotionally, physically and sexually), naturally it traumatised me.

I have avoided visiting my old deaf school for more than 30 years but I still remember that awful place.

Does anyone else here feel the same about their deaf schools?

[댓글]
I also had an oral education both by a deaf program/school and mainstream school. 

I don’t use this word often but it was traumatizing, and set back my language skills for years. 

Soon after I moved to another Deaf school I finally found acceptance and pride in who I am, and thrived. 

It took me years, even decades to work out that it was normal to feel that way and how to learn to live with it - both mentally and physically.

I’m sorry you went through this!!! So many questions on why a whole school would exist like this. I was mainstreamed and it was abusive there. Is there no safe place on earth for us? A school putting itself out there for deaf kids and forcing them to be something their not and failing really lost the thread. I was never taught sign language it wasn’t even considered. So what’s the right path for deaf kids? It’s really scary for them. Hearing parents are as clueless. I went no contact with mine over all this bs.

I don't have personal experience since I was mainstreamed, but know someone who went to a deaf oral school in the North. It was back in the 80s and they shared experiences of horrific abuse at the hands of teachers and adults there. It's not my story to tell, but I can't imagine what it must have been like back then - to have your language denied (and by extension, connection with the other kids) and the shame instilled in a key part of your identity. Of course that stays with you.  I hope you're getting the support you need.

It's truly awful that you went through that. I hope this really isn't the case anymore. 

I certainly know though that due to the lack of education about deafness in mainstream education, there are some staff there that don't fully get what a hearing loss is like. 

I wear hearing aids and went to mainstream schools and while the majority of staff were understanding, there were definitely some staff that just didn't get it.

My daughter went to a deaf school for some of highschool. It was a wing within a regular school so their core classes were in the Deaf school but they could take electives with the regular classes. The dorm staff were amazing! They were very aware of the abuse that happened to previous generations and so they talked about it openly, had posters on the wall, talked about consent and privacy with the kids and their parents. The told the parents that disabled kids are at high risk of being abused and exploited by others. They had mental health support and made sure kids accessed it if they needed it. The dorm staff went above and beyond. 
The school was hit and miss. The principal was honest and this job was just a placeholder for a year, she didn't care about deaf kids. Most of the teachers were good but some were just checked out. Only one that was a bit mean.

I never went to a deaf school, so I can’t comment. I was mainstream educated for the majority - apart from a small amount of time in a special nursery - I’m really sorry you’ve went through that….

The story may be different from urs but my father went to deaf school called Donaldson’s school between 1960s to mid 1970s. He was being screamed at and beaten with large heavy key, ruler and other tools or sometimes fists when he failed to understand the teachers or didn’t follow the rules. He told me other deaf students got graped by the person who worked there, the man who was in the toilet, waiting for kids to come into the bathroom at night and then trapped the kids to grape them, It was terrifying! Years later, the man was caught graping kids he went to the attic and committed suicide with paper on him, saying “I love children” before police found him.
several years later, Donaldson’s school was shut down for the different reason it was the financial issue.

I was placed in public and private schools in the 70s and 80s and was usually the only deaf kid. I had undiagnosed ADHD as well, and my mother was a speech therapist who looked down on ASL. Hearing kids can be so mean. My schooling experiences and my mother's attitude were so painful that, like OP, I never went back to my schools, and my mother's attitude was one reason why I broke contact with her.",2025-09-13 07:29:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nfrb8d/survived_abusive_deaf_school/
1nfixyl,deaf,Driving #ASL,"Okay, so this is an honest question with no hate or judgement. 

I saw two people in a car today where both the driver and passenger were using ASL to communicate. How does the deaf community and other’s feel about ASL while driving? #ASL #driving 

[댓글]
I’m sorry—I hate this. I know you’re asking an honest question with no hate or judgment, but it’s frustrating that ASL gets singled out. The real issue is driver distraction, not the language. Hearing people talk or sing; Deaf folks sign. Same safety rule for everyone: eyes on the road, hands on the wheel, keep it brief, wait for a stop, or pull over for longer conversations.

Deaf drivers are licensed everywhere, and there’s no evidence we crash more. So instead of “Is ASL while driving appropriate?” the better question is “How do drivers manage any conversation safely?” Focus on the behavior, not the language.

I'm not against deafies using SL while driving as long  they can drive safely. I know very few deaf friends 100% shouldn't be using SL while driving. It sames goes with hearings too. Distracting while driving increases the risk of getting in car accidents. 

That's my 2 cents.

Why the hastags?

It’s perfectly safe and equal to spoken language. If you’re having an intense conversation and not paying attention to the road, sure that’s problematic.
I’m able to sign to my friends while they focus, some of us use extra mirrors to see the backseat, and so on.

I was raised in hearing culture and I'll admit I used to have this question too - not just because of the hands off the steering wheel, but also because of the driver looking at the passenger. Other comments have covered the former. I'll add that Deaf folks tend to have exceptionally good peripheral vision. Where a hearing person might need to look at their passenger to understand SL, a Deaf person who's used to visually tracking several things at once will not find it as distracting as you might think. Plus the passenger will sign closer to the driver's field of vision.

Before texting, I believe there was evidence that Deaf folks tended to have fewer accidents than hearing folks. Then texting leveled the playing field for everyone.

I'm able to eat snacks while diving sometimes. I'm able to quickly check my passenger's facial expressions or see if they are sleeping. I can put on my sunglasses. Sometimes I can hold a spoken conversation. Sometimes I'll use a few signs to support my English when driving with a HoH friend. Other times I refrain from all of this because I need to focus. I feel like yelling at my friend is more distracting than just throwing in the signs that I know. 

My conclusion is that it fits in with other stuff and isn't any worse or better. It depends on the individual and the conditions, from what I can see.

You felt you safely could assess their driving skill from across the road? Maybe you shouldn't be distracted driving yourself? The entire intent of this question feels icky. It has such an ableist vibe to it. I've heard this my entire life, how do the deaf drive? Do better.",2025-09-12 23:59:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nfixyl/driving_asl/

Hi. You could look into seeing if Liverpool are trialling shirts for Deaf fans. Newcastle were the first to do it, but I’m not sure if other clubs have picked up on it…? You’ll probably need to directly contact the club to find out more….

Also, this site might be of use!

How deaf is he? As in can he feel vibrations?... And I can hear the college beat it out, and I'm the referee on the sidelines with the flag. They can be pretty loud.  Especially in the bleachers. I can feel it in the air

I guess what I'm really asking has he gone to one of the stadium games?

Holding a balloon can amplify vibrations. It might give him a more access to the sounds. Show, don't tell for teaching piano. We all have an inner beat (heartbeat) and we can move in sync with others. 
If you can break down the music into different parts, that'll help. Usually orchestra's are a cacophony to me but I got to attend a rehearsal once and hear/see all the individual instruments playing. When they all played together at the end, it made so much more sense. Hearing and identifying sounds are two different things.

The showtune?

I assume it's the version by ""Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers""? They're from the UK. If you know which version they sing at the games lmk and I'll see what's out there.

1nf5ysc,deaf,My Petition,"Hey guys! I just have a bit of an ask if you have a minute or two to spare.

I am a student at Clemson University and want to minor in ASL, but my major, Political Science, doesn't recognize ASL as a a different language from English. Which honestly is insane considering how many differences there are between the two languages.

Their exact quote is ""ASL is a vital and important medium for communicating in English, but studying sign language does not achieve the same academic goals as studying another language.""

So as a protest, I have made a petition that I am trying to get as many people as possible to sign to show the Political Science department that ASL isn't the same as English.

I really do greatly appreciate anyone who could sign, it would mean the world to me if I was able to change a discriminatory policy with your support!!!

[댓글]
I don't think a petition is what you want. They're being objectively wrong. It's not a matter of opinion. ASL is NOT a medium for English. 


Try contacting NAD, Gallaudet University, your schools ombudsman's office, and possibly a legal advisor. 


It's horrifying for an authority at a ""top 50"" school to be so painfully ignorant on such a topic. 


Good luck, report back if you make any progress.

I was really hoping that maybe you got bad advice from an advisor or something similar. Looking at the Clemson catalog, it is clear as day, under the Political Science, BA, Footnote 3: ""Students must complete through 2020 in any modern language except American Sign Language."" ([https://catalog.clemson.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=46&amp;poid=14941&amp;hl=political&amp;returnto=search](https://catalog.clemson.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=46&amp;poid=14941&amp;hl=political&amp;returnto=search))

This is definitely linguicism.

That’s beyond belief. Sign language is recognised as a different language - be that ASL or BSL or AUSLAN, all three are very much distinct from English

I can’t believe this is still happening. *Years* ago my teachers had to fight for ASL to be included in the language requirement. The sticking point was “culture.” Nobody believed that ASL had a related culture like French or Japanese. That was a fight they eventually won by teaching people that “culture” means a lot more than “written literature.”

But to say ASL is just manual coded English? I guess I’m shocked but not surprised that a college would still have such an ancient, creaky, pre-Stokoe conception of sign language.

I am happy to sign, but have you reached out to Disability Advocates in your area? I think this can be approached as a legal issue, which will garner a quicker response by administration.

If ASL was simply a different way of communicating in English, then Signed Exact English would be redundant and wouldn't need to exist. If ASL was a way of communicating in English, then people who sign ASL and BSL (since American English and British English are both English) would be able to understand each other perfectly instead of needing to teach each other their respective languages. If ASL was a way of communicating in English, I would have had no trouble keeping up with fully Deaf native signers when I tried to learn as a partially deaf English speaker and would've just fingerspelled everything all the time because it would've just been English. 🙄

Languages are something I really care about, but even if I didn't I think it would be obvious that this definition is incorrect. I hope the resources people have directed you to in this thread help, and you get the people who made this language-limiting to see how ASL is not only a language but one that matters.

Claiming ASL isn’t a language is a form of audism.

All US states legally recognize ASL as a separate language and in some cases a foreign language credit in high school

I signed. You're off to a good start. 
Find your state’s policy – search “ASL recognized as foreign language [your state] NAD and screenshot the law if it exists.

• Show precedent,  look up nearby colleges that do accept ASL and include that in your appeal.
• Involve student government/faculty – they can push for a policy review or curriculum change.
• Escalate if needed – file a grievance citing Title VI (language discrimination) or Section 504 for equal access. NAD or state Deaf advocacy groups can help with wording.

Hopefully, something can be done.

As someone whose first language is ASL then had to learn written English when I started school this is absolutely factually incorrect. ASL is NOT signed English its a totally different language that is based on French sign language. BSL or British Sign Language is completely different. This is just so wrong and is discrimination/audism/ignorance/etc. DEF contact NAD and Gallaudet!!! Please keep us updated! ♡

1nepjkq,deaf,annoyed by audiologists,"my old hearing aid place called me. I haven't heard from them since early 2020 when the doctor made me kinda feel judged for being in the hospital for a while, cuz he asked why they hadnt seen me for a few months for my usual battery pickups. idk, there was just a face he made. and then he refused to sign my paperwork for a bus pass for people with disabilities, saying i had to get that from my regular doctor, even though he'd done it no problem just a few years earlier. and then I'd asked for my records, and they never got back to me about mailing them or me coming in to get them. they also told me to buy aids because the ones I had in 2020 were from 2013 and 'we wont have the parts for these much longer. here's our website to see what we have available.' and all their options were like $7k, and I didnt have that kind of money or credit. so I just didnt call them back.

I went a couple years without using the 2013 pair much,  cuz masks made it hard to want to wear my hearing aids at work (i also rarely wore my glasses), and my hearing loss is such that I can hear *decently* (im at maybe 30db for that frequency) for person-to-person conversation if not much is happening around me. I then had money to buy a pair from a company that doesnt go through an audiologist, cuz I saw an ad that the aids were on sale for $250. they fit like earbuds, and they worked alright. they lasted for about a year, until someone singing very loudly right behind me at a Wicked singalong last year destroyed the microphones. so I bought a new pair in January, from the same company but the next pair up, that are over the ear and can connect to my phone via Bluetooth. theyre amazing.

so anyway, the hearing aid people from 2013-2020 call me today. it's been over 5 years?? and the lady is like 'when would you like to come in?' and im like 'uhh I have new ones...' 

'so you're not interested?'
'no... what i WOULD be interested in is my records. I can give you my new address.'
'oh. well I have to talk to the provider and he'll have to get those ready, and you'll have to come in to get those. we'll call when theyre ready. ok bye' and she hung up. 

great customer service skills 🙄

It blows my mind when an audiologist office cold calls deaf people by default... Like - shockingly - phone calls are not the ideal way to get ahold of m - send a fucking email hdffdsafa

I’m so so sorry I know exactly what you’re dealing with! It makes me feel so desperate. I’m trying to get a hearing aid since June and 2 audiologists just dropped the ball entirely on the process. When calling around new places some act so annoyed to be talking to me as I’m trying to get a decent hearing aid covered by insurance. 

Think gently of the Stanford University Prison experiment that they had to stop because the “guards” got too sadistic. I think it’s the same way with these in the professions to “help”. It’s such a subtle control trip! 

I don’t know how to deal with it. I feel like my housing was taken away when one audiologist stopped taking my insurance in the middle of the ordering process. It’s that level of crisis. But just fade away into that good night. No hearing aid for me!

Sorry wish I had more help!

Just FYI: If you happen to be in the USA, you have the legal right under HIPPA to request that your medical records be mailed to you. They can charge you for using certified mail to make it secure, but they aren't allowed to outright deny that request. You should not have to go in for them. If they need you to fill out release paperwork to get your records you can request that be emailed or mailed to you and then you can sign it and send it back. There's no need to go in to see them. Audiologists are not regular doctors because most of them are also running a hearing aid selling business and that's likely why he wants you to come in again, so he can try to pressure you to continue buying hearing aids from him.

I’m fighting my audiologist for help. Like i’ve lost reg convo dBs. Isnt that a good starting point for hearing aids? So between hard of hearing in my left ear and extremely low/mid dB deaf in my right i can barely understand anything. God I just wanna go back to covid. Lol

1nel5oj,deaf,Accessibility in Music,"For context I have some meaningful hearing damage - I very barely qualify for hearing aids - but would not consider myself HoH or Deaf. 

I am a drummer and audio engineer, so sound is a large part of my professional life, and as a consequence I don't have a lot of experience interacting with Deaf or very HoH people day-to-day. I've read on other posts on this form about Deaf/HoH peoples' experiences with music, live, recorded, interpreted, etc. Some people seem to not be interested at all, others interested in limited contexts, some quite enjoy it.

Of course this community is not a monolith, but I'm curious - for those of you who are interested in and enjoy it - what can musician, sound engineers, etc do to make the music that you enjoy better ***specifically for you.*** Any ""I wish"" type statements that would make listening to music a better experience? Is there anything that you've found frustrating about music that could be addressed? eg. inclusion of specific instruments, features, etc. 

I don't want this to come off as market research... I guess it's a goal to fill in a personal blindspot of mine, and hopefully gain some perspective towards making art, or versions of art, that isn't actively terrible for Deaf/HoH people. Feel free to get as picky and personal as you'd like. Open to anything and everything, including ""nothing"".

If you make video of any kind for anything on any platform caption ALL of it, and do it well. Outsource it from a major player like 3play Media, WGBH, National Captioning Institute, etc. Or have someone in house that can do it equally well. It needs to be a non-negotiable part of post-production on every clip of video produced.

Im deaf in one ear, so being able to adjust music from stereo to all sounds in mono is a big one. Also, music that doesn't do too much left-right jumping around is appreciated.
For your hearing - if you suspect damage - I'd recommend a hearing check/developing a relationship with an audiologist. Yearly hearing checks are often covered by insurance. As a musician, I have Widex hearing aids specifically for music and they make a BIG difference.

GOOD sound engineering makes all the difference; you're making music, not just blasting noise. So keeping things well balanced is vital. Avoid extra fuss in the layering and keep it clean. Can you (the hearing individual) hear the nuance between instruments? Are you able to hear the vocalist over the instrumentals? How balanced is that? Are you going to lose one or the other if the tone shifts slightly? Make sure there's room in the music for the two to exist (things done in the booth anyway)-- so once you have all that....  make sure the bass and the beat match without becoming ""noise""; when I'm going to a concert I want to feel the music as much as I want to hear what is in my hearing range. I've noticed in concerts this can happen because of poor-quality sound system on the behalf of the venue, so not always something that can be remedied by the artist at that level, but if I think about music I listened to before losing my hearing vs now, the difference is in how the artist plays with depth of the track, where the vocals lay vs the music. 

I LOVE the way things are being engineered now, but I don't have the liberty of being able to hear all the nuances, and it makes me sad (though I love Mariana's Trench and they just released the instrumental version of their album Haven, and I am SO excited)-- but really it's just a matter of finding that sweet spot between elements without creating a band of ""noise"" (where things are too close in tone and improperly layered so it's too flat when in mono vs stereo; the listening experience should be vivid, preferably no matter where you register on the scale of hearing imo because music should be for everyone). 

Also, I would like to say let's do some integrated subtitles in music videos. You know lyric videos have beautiful (mostly legible) lyrics follow the song on the screen? Cool! Love that! Let's make sure it's a bit more legible; but also, let's put the lyrics into the music video itself, not just in a lyric video, since subtitling can get the details wrong and cover up part of the visual effects.

This won't help your research any but wear earplugs.

They had a thing a few years ago with compensatory leveling, kinda like an IEM but not really. Aumeo made it. Some guy I know swore by it. I never used it personally. Here's some guy's review. 

https://youtu.be/MwVVfbCWXhE?si=H09hMceB2Bt2NBLZ

re: hearing loss

People have different kinds of hearing loss. My high end is pretty much gone and a lot of mids are passable but kinda eh. I can record music without any significant problems but I can't mix/master well. I wind up slamming everything into the red.

There's a documentary called Sign The Show, you might find interesting:


https://www.signtheshow.com/

I hate when songs have vocals go from one ear to the other on a track, or different instruments are playing on one or the other, because one of my ears is worse than the other. I used to think it was a cool gimmick when I was a lot younger, like 'ohhh surround sound! neat!' but my hearing loss is one where im getting deafer as I get older. im at probably around 50-70db on most frequencies now. my hearing aids hook up to my phone via Bluetooth, and I have them set at 70% for hearing the world at a 'normal' volume, as far as I feel used to be how I heard it back when I was younger, but I have my music at 100% volume and can barely hear some songs, like Africa by Toto is almost impossible to hear. I actually switch to regular earbuds for the bus so I can hear my music better (still at 100%), but I still have a hard time with stuff going from one ear to the other. 

I actually came across an audiobook the other week where the character telling the story kept having 'aside' conversation moments with the other narrator, where she'd kinda step back from the mic. I could barely understand a word of what was said. i ended up downgrading my rating of the book because of it and wrote that in my review, saying 'this sucked, as a deaf reader. some of us arent fully deaf, it's a spectrum, but you should be more mindful.' idk, they'll probably do it again for the sequel and I'll just have to deal, cuz the first book was good enough to go back for more.

1nel1s3,deaf,Hearing aid batteries packaging have gotten too difficult! Child-resistant packaging should be optional.,"Just let me rant for a minute: 

I buy size 675 hearing aid batteries from the local grocery store and sometimes I buy them online. But, in the last year, every hearing aid battery pack I've received have been the child-resistant ones no matter where I buy them from. Gone are the days of quickly and discreetly changing out the battery while out and about. The plastic is now supposed to be cut with scissors but even the sharpest kitchen shears don't easily cut through the plastic! So guess what happened??? I freaking stabbed my thumb trying to open the packaging and thankfully, I don't need stitches. I used to be able to change out the batteries under the table without even looking and keep lip-reading to stay in the conversation. Now I have to excuse myself to the bathroom and try to open the rest of packaging to free a new battery. I swear people think I'm doing drugs in the bathroom from all the plastic crinkling noises I'm causing. And asking the restaurant or store for scissors is annoying.

""You should switch to rechargeable batteries"" you say? Oh that's a whole different issue. The rechargeable battery kit for my Med-El CI processor is very finicky and randomly disconnects and suddenly everything goes quiet. When that happens I have to try to restart the processor similar to trying to get a car engine to turn over. Like, you're repeatedly turning the ignition and impatiently wait for the engine to come back to life. 

I can't be the only one dealing with this! 

[댓글]
I am hunting down all the old packs I have so I can cut open the new ones and refill the old packaging. It’s ridiculous, and they expect seniors to be able to easily open these?

It’s a federal law that any new battery sold in the US has to be in this terrible packaging. Look up Reese’s Law. 
Keep in mind that if you’re buying them from a supplier who has the “old packaging” that the batteries were manufactured before March 2024 (and are therefore closer to their expiration date!)

I buy Power One batteries from Amazon, from Germany, &amp; they’re the old-style packs!  🙂

I use 675 as well and drug store packaging has been a bitch to open.

So much this.

I ended up buying a battery case and I'll just spend a while opening packs with scissors (still difficult) and put the batteries in the case so I can actually get to them.

I cannot agree with this more. I had an absolute fit trying to open the most recent package. I have carpal tunnel and that made it just impossible. The packaging is ableist.

Literally got a membership to Costco because the hearing aid batteries were cheaper but they're all in child resistent packaging. I asked and apparently it's a new regulation. How am I supposed to keep hearing aid batteries in my purse when they all end up falling out of the container immediately?

Try the DuraCell HA batts, scissors only needed for the outer package, nice snap-top box inside.  Long tabs too.

I found a trick. At least on my powerone hearing aid batteries. I fold one bottom corner back and I'm able to separate the papers and then I separate the plastic from the paper. No scissors needed! It worked with my powerone hearing aid batteries. I don't know if it works with other brands. I would say that this is a weak spot in the child-proof design, at least on powerone batteries.

Thank you! I hate having to use scissors to get my batteries.

You can get scissors or buy non-child resistant packs online.

They're like that because it's a potentially fatal medical emergency if an infant, toddler, pet, or severely developmentally disabled or demented adult eats even a dead one. A live one is much worse.

The packs are very easy to open with scissors if you do it a certain way. Take the plastic part of the back so you just have the plastic disc with the batteries in it. Then cut close to the battery on the left and the right side of the battery you want, and then you can lift it up like a little tab and the batteries will just fall right out. (This should be doable by a senior who can live independently safely or it can be done really quickly for an entire pack for them if need be by an able bodied family, friend, or caregiver who knows how.)

Oh I hear you, girl.  I also wondered if it was just me 😆

Yeah I hate it too. I just rip the entire pack open at a time  and put the batteries in a case.",2025-09-11 21:23:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nel1s3/hearing_aid_batteries_packaging_have_gotten_too/
1nehldc,deaf,Can someone be deaf and still have loud tinnitus?,"Hello all,

Can someone be deaf and still have loud tinnitus?  


[댓글]
Lot's of great and interesting sharing of experience with tinnitus in this thread.  As a mod I want to add a little PSA that many of you likely know already.  **If you're having trouble with tinnitus be sure to get a health checkup with your doctor**. (primary care/general practice). **Blood pressure, both too high and too low, will exacerbate tinnitus** and getting that under control is a first line of defense.

Yes

Yup. Tinnitus is in the brain, not in the ears.

The worst part? Even though tinnitus starts in the ear, it's really in the brain. I've heard about tinnitus so severe it's not even cured by severing the auditory nerve.

Yes, tinnitus works like phantom limb sensations, it’s the same principle

Tinnitus is essentially caused by the absence of sound (or at least that’s what I’ve been told) so yes, being deaf myself, I experience loud tinnitus even to the point where it has affected my sleep.

Born deaf. Am 58. Have had tinnitus off and on since high school &amp; I graduated in '85. 

Sounds like a whistle that's got a little reverb. 

Annoying as *frick*. 

I can usually stop it by listening to music I like. Couple hours of bluegrass/folk-rock and I'm set for a few days/week. 

Currently listening to [Alison Kraus *Ghost in the House*](https://youtu.be/dWRGZaHb8xE)

I was pretty much born with tinnitus. 

I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and HoH in my left. And I cannot remember a time when I didn't have tinnitus. As a child, I slept with a radio on. As I got older, I started using fans blowing on me at night. But fans keep getting quieter, so now I have a white noise machine that is just static. Without something to help mask it, the tinnitus would keep me awake. It's constant and sometimes changes intensity or pitch.

Very much so.

Oh yes

I have loudest tinnitus in brain and I am 90% deaf.

Unfortunately.

And being deaf can make some people experience it as **louder**.

yeah

Oh yes

I didn't get tinnitus in my left ear UNTIL it suddenly went deaf.

[deleted]

Yeah, don’t recommend having tinnitus (joke) I deal with it everyday. I’m not deaf but I have a friend who is that has tinnitus bc she lost her hearing due to loud sound exposure which gives you tinnitus. It’s not something that’s in ur ears and not something you can get rid of I’m pretty sure.

Yep.

Yup.

Yup all the time. I suffer from it and mask it by wearing hearing aids

Yep

Yes, I suffer from it occasionally.

Yes. Severe bilateral loss here since birth and when I get Tinnitus it’s like I have a referee’s whistle blowing in my ears. Non stop. For days at a time. Have learned a few triggers (stress, lack of sleep) but mostly it’s random and difficult to deal with. There are people with far worse conditions so I just accept it.

Yup. When I had my cochlear implant surgery I had it pretty bad until my implant was turned on.

Yup :))))))

I have late hearing loss and have tinnitus, which seems to get worse as my hearing goes. I've met a bunch of people born profoundly deaf that have it as well but I was told it's more common if you have acquired hearing loss from my audiologist.

yep.

Yes.  Bit unfair, that.

Yeah, I was born deaf. I have a long life with tinnitus since I was a kid. When I don't wear hearing aids or CIs, tinnitus appears in my right ear louder than my left ear. Tinnitus is coming from the brain.

Yes.

I'm HoH not deaf. There's a couple of different types but a number have nothing to do with hearing really, though.  I have one of them. I've had multiple concussions. Mine's incidental to head trauma.

If you're having problems sleeping and have some hearing, consider getting a white noise or pink noise machine or leave on a youtube refrigerator video or something. Some people like rain. They make those machines too but youtube works just as well just put your tv or tablet on sleep timer. I'm lucky in that I live in an old apartment and have a very old, very loud refrigerator and my water drips and all my pipes creak.

If you just started having tinnitus, the nerve deadens or something and you just kind of get used to it after a few months. It's still there and annoying but it's not like you can't sleep. At first I couldn't sleep. Drove me nuts.

yep. that'd be me.

Yep, it’s so annoying

Yup.

I have severe-profound hearing loss (since age 4, currently 27), and wear hearing aids. don't quite qualify for CIs. I experience pretty bad tinnitus, especially in my left ear, which is my ""worse"" ear. my hearing aids helps to mask the sound, but it gets real rough at night when trying to sleep!

Yes , I'm 44m from Greece and deaf/hard of hearing and I often get high t-spikes when I'm stressed or I consume things that make t spike up and I always try to find online tips to reduce these spikes in many ways

Maybe even worse: I have tinnitus in a frequency I can’t hear anymore*. I am profoundly deaf in that ear. It’s also surprisingly loud.",2025-09-11 19:08:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nehldc/can_someone_be_deaf_and_still_have_loud_tinnitus/
1nefgv0,deaf,Struggling at Job Networking,"Does anyone have any suggestions on how to go about networking as a deaf person? It's a struggle in person and I am desperately in need of work. And LinkedIn feels basically useless.

[댓글]
That depends on your job objective-- if it's a job within the Deaf world (residential school, social services agency, K-12 program, VR, etc., etc.), then lean heavily on your network from school/college/community. 

If it's a general job outside of that, add to your friends and social network that you're already tapping into with family: parents, uncles, aunts, and family friends. Mom and Dad's old friend works at a big company? Mention you're looking for a job. Your favorite uncle's best friend works at the company you want to work at? Mention you're looking for work and it's your ideal company.

Ask these people for feedback on your resume while you're at it. Even if they don't know of any jobs or can't refer you, it's an innocuous way to get your resume in their face. They can then see what you've done, and that implants in their mind subconsciously where you might fit. Later they may run across something that you'd be good for, and they may tell you.

Networking as a D/deaf person means having to go outside your comfort zone sometimes, especially compared with hearing people. It's not fun nor is it easy, but it's essential. Don't hide the fact that you're looking for work. Notify people about that, and mention your strong skills. Now is the time for a little self-promotion. 

It's not easy to look for a job, even in the best of times (and right now, it's getting difficult...). Good luck!

I love Maryland, I'm from there, but unfortunately, Maryland has the most limited Vocational Rehabilitation of all the states, I think. But try them anyway. Ask them if they have any waiting list you can get on the bottom of or any suggestion or any place that they are connected with to help with this. They will probably say no, but it's worth asking. It's so unfortunate. Other states can usually be more helpful. Usually.

The job market is extra F#$ked right now. (At least in the USA) Where do you live? 


Be willing to pivot to a line of work or career that you might not have considered otherwise.

This is my struggle as well. I don't have great advice, but here's some tips.

One on one is preferred. 
Be open about your needs.
Video conferences are captioned &amp; transcribed.
Attend seminars and whatnot -- everyone is there to network.
Nothing wrong with LinkedIn, but its not a personal connection.

What do you do for work?

Vocational rehab and the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Professionals group on Linkedin would be good starting points. [Deaf and Hard of Hearing Professionals | Groups | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/920227/)

Are you in the US?

I struggle with finding gainful employment as well. I neither have a marketable skill, degree under my belt, and am afraid of losing hearing every time I leave my home. I guess not that it matters god bless my grandma but she honked a horn 2 feet away from me from an attached garage down a hallway in which I was standing wholly unprepared for the complete loss of my all of my low/mid dBs.

I used to teach people how to network for work and for jobs.  The process is the same whether or not you're deaf.  Would it be helpful to set up a teams meeting so some of us could have a conversation about this?  I hope I'm not violating any rules by making this suggestion.  Not looking to charge - just to network.",2025-09-11 17:47:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1nefgv0/struggling_at_job_networking/
1ne0lpa,deaf,I feel like my wife resents me for being HoH/deaf,"Just need a place to explore my thoughts. 

This morning, I was trying to tell her a story about my son who had some pancakes for breakfast. I was speaking in front of a stove hood (deflection of sound) and my son was making a lot of noise. She said she couldn’t hear me. So I made a facial expression look like a playful annoyed/funny with a nudge towards my son, like “oh I understand, let me start over”. So I started speaking again. Then she got really upset and blew up at me and called me an a-hole. She said that’s what I do to her when I claim I don’t hear her. I tried to explain what my facial expressions were doing at that it wasn’t because I was annoyed at repeating myself or at her. I apologized over and over and she shut down. 

We’ve had issues with communication and additionally,I feel like she resents me for being deaf/HoH. 

Edit: thank you everyone. 

[댓글]
From what you've written, I can't see resentment about your deafness. But maybe that's a different story? From this story, it sounds like she's frustrated that you made a face about repeating yourself, when she can't do the same. We know it's considered poor etiquette to be annoyed or unaccommodating when a deaf person needs something repeated, but it works both ways. If she needs to be neutral when repeating herself, you should take the same approach, even if she is hearing.

When your wife says ""that's what you do to her"" when you claim you don't hear her, is she talking about her own angry reaction? Or is she saying that you get upset when she makes a face at having to repeat herself?  

  
Either way, it sounds like a conversation around communication needs and potential related resentments needs to happen, once both of you have calmed down from the initial conflict and are ready to come to the table for solutions.

I don't know if resentment is the right word, but there is some tension. 


I'm going to guess that you weren't deaf at the beginning of the relationship, correct me if I'm wrong. 


The best advice I can offer is to know and remember that whenever you feel a little hint of frustration coming on, your partner is also frustrated possibly more so, even if they're not showing it yet. Keeping this in mind and possibly acknowledging the frustration they feel can go a long way. 


I started dating my (hearing) wife almost 15 years ago and sometimes I still have to tell her when she's talking to me with her hands in front of her face. We have a long mutual understanding that I won't understand her if I can't see her face. When we go out before nightfall, sometimes we'll sit down at a restaurant or whatever and I'll ask her to swap places with me because she's backlit. She's awesome about that. 


Make sure your wife knows you see and appreciate her carrying her side of the communication barrier. It might be long over due to have a conversation about this. 


Good luck.

The question is- why is she frustrated with something you can not control? If you were in a wheelchair it would not be cool for your GF to become frustrated because it takes you 10 minutes to get out of the wheelchair and into the car. 

I think she does have issues. I don’t know if resentment is accurate, but definitely not being sensitive.

Your wife knew you were deaf when she married you, so I don't believe that it's your hearing that she resents. It's just your style of communication that she seems to dislike. Strongly encourage to sit her down and ask how you can work on it so she doesn't feel so upset the next time you guys have a miscommunication. Also if you haven't apologized, apologize lol just to meditate things.",2025-09-11 05:31:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ne0lpa/i_feel_like_my_wife_resents_me_for_being_hohdeaf/
1ndxj0b,deaf,What's the journey for getting deafness analysis for a 6 month old?,"Hello. My son is 6 months old now. He passed his newborn hearing screening. This is why we never thought hearing would be an issue for him. Around when he's 6 months, I was just thinking how he doesn't coo to us. Isn't it time that he coos or talks a bit? We started doing testing, banging really loud forks against bowls in front of his ears, banging doors, and nothing... no reaction. I scheduled him to an audiologist, who performed basic tests for him. Test #1: testing if his ear drums vibrate. The test shows his ear drums do not vibrate so the audiologist thinks there's fluid behind his ear drums. Test #2: testing if the middle ear responds. The test shows his middle ear doesn't respond much, potentially due to the fluid. The audiologist recommends me to see an ENT. Then I went to ENT, who said there's no fluid behind his ears at all, and that I should go back to the audiologist for a sleep ABR test.

I'm incredibly sad, and frustrated at the same time.

1. I felt like I'm just being bounced around between doctors. Every time I switch a doctor I have to wait weeks for an appointment. My son is already 6 months old and I'm very worried about his development.
2. None of the doctors are telling me what to expect. I have so many questions and they just don't answer them. All they say is, ""there are many causes, we need full analysis before knowing what's going on"", but I felt like I'm left in the dark, wondering around in my own head with the worst thoughts floating and they're eating me alive.

So friends on Reddit, could you please please help me answer some questions:

1. What's the difference between a newborn hearing screening, and a ABR test?
2. What comes ABR test? Is ABR test the final test that can determine the cause of hearing? Or can ABR test determine the degree of hearing? Is ABR test good enough to create a hearing aid? Is ABR test good enough to determine if he has profound deafness? Could you let me know what comes after ABR tests?
3. The audiologist says there's some obstructions behind his ears, that's why his ear drums do not vibrate. But the ENT said there aren't any fluids. What other causes could there be on why his ear drums do not vibrate, on BOTH sides?
4. The ENT said they do not drain fluids even if there's fluid behind the ear drums. They let it drain naturally first. Is this true?
5. My son is already 6 months old, and if it takes many more visits to figure out what's going on, let's say he gets hearing aid at 9 months old. Will he ever catch up language wise? If so, when will he catch up? Or are we too late for everything?
6. Does hearing aid and cochlear ear work well for kids with hearing loss? Or do we need to prepare ourselves for learning sign language? I read somewhere that most people wearing hearing aid and cochlear ear choose to discontinue using them, due to discomfort or something, and that if I do not learn sign language, I may never communicate to my child. So learning sign language is a must. Is this true?

Thank you so much for any insights you can provide.

This is a hard journey as a parent, and that's okay. 

I really can't answer your test related questions but I will say this. Even if your child gets hearing aids or a cochlear, you should be learning ASL and signing with him. It's great for development in any child but when it comes to a child with hearing loss it's so so important because it fosters open accessible communication and will help him to interact with the Deaf/HoH community as well. 

A hearing aid or cochlear is a tool, it is not a substitute for normal hearing. I can assure you it will benefit all of you if you start learning ASL now.

Speaking to question 6 and sort of 5, the only ones I’m qualified to answer: You say “if I do not learn sign language, I may never communicate to my child.” Try to change your perspective to something like this: “Giving my child sign language, the natural language of deaf people, will ensure that he will develop linguistic fluency.”

If your son is deaf/hard-of-hearing, he can learn English alongside ASL and thus become bilingual. Bilingualism is a great benefit to a developing brain, whether deaf or hearing, because signed and spoken languages are both controlled by the exact same areas of the brain. And then you and he can both decide how best you want to communicate with each other. The key is giving your son’s brain the basis of language that it needs to develop normally. 

But don’t worry, 6 months is not at all too late to start! It’s very easy with lots of free online resources to start learning the basics of ASL so you can use them with your son. Lots of — but not nearly enough — parents begin learning sign when they have a deaf baby, so you are not alone, and those kids grow up with great language skills! 

(Try to seek out resources by Deaf creators. I can’t currently give you a list of links but I’ll check back on this later and post some if nobody has yet. Deaf language advocates/activists will be so glad you’re trying to learn ASL for your baby and you will find great support in your language journey.)

I’m sure you’ll do your research on this and learn what you need to know. I just wanted you to consider taking that original sentence, which is a negative proposition, and reformulating it into a positive opportunity.

edit: added some more stuff

Ok Your post covers a LOT of ground. It's almost too much to really answer.  So I'll tell you about my persona deafness journey and hopefully that will help,. Also what you're going to want to do first is research online about how the human ear works.  And learn what some common treatments and what they provide based on where the pathology/problem is with the ear.  

There are three main parts of the human ear, outer, middle and inner.  Problems with one or more of the three parts can result in hearing loss or deafness. Where the problem lies is going to dictate what kind of treatment is possible if any, and things like that.  In a nutshell,  As you have questions you can ask here but please be sure to keep your questions from being too close to medical advice, we can't answer those. 

OK.  your first question is about hearing screenings for infants/children. It will vary greatly from location to location but by definition a hearing screening is just a hearing test. It can be any kind of hearing test depending on policy or regulation.  When I was a child it was not something that was a standard procedure. But I was born hearing so, it's a little beside the point.  As far as I know, if it's suspected a child has hearing loss after a screening they will prescribe an ABR (auditory brainstem response test) I had one as a teenager.  They're very reliable tests, and totally non-invasive.  they put earbud type headphones on the patient and little sticky electrode thingys on the scalp and read brain waves while playing sound for a while. You don't have to be awake for the test to work so they will sedate very young children typically so they can sit still. When I was a teen and had one they put me in a dim room with this big comfy chair and I fell asleep while it was happening. 

If I were a parent and in your shoes, I would be very frustrated too. The doctors are right though that it's best to test all the possible tests and narrow where the issue is, and there could be multiple factors at play. Then they can refer you to the right specialist for treatment if treatment is an option.  You ask about ABR tests off the bat and it's important to keep in mind that you want to determine what's going on with the middle ear because if the vibrations stop in the middle ear due to fluid or some other problem, the ABR will show hearing loss because the signal didn't get to the brain. (that's all an ABR test does really sees, if signals get to the brain, it can't tell you where the sound signal is getting blocked so you have to test things in a certain order) 

&gt;The audiologist says there's some obstructions behind his ears, that's why his ear drums do not vibrate. But the ENT said there aren't any fluids.

OK this is getting too far into medical advice but I can share what I know from first hand experience.  The ear drum (also called the tympanic membrane) can be measured for it's responsiveness.  This is a very common ailment in young children due to the shape of their heads (more round compared to adults). The eustachian tube is as a more shallow angle and sometimes fluid buildup can occur. When I was a young child (~4), an ENT extracted some goop out of my ear through eardrum, and then put in an ear tube/grommet that I had for a few weeks that allowed air pressure to be more equalized and for things to drain and clear up.  I had this again a few years later in the same ear. They saved my hearing in that ear. (A few years later as a teen I went deaf anyway due to unrelated causes) 

So anyway to test the ear drum (this is a VERY common test for routine children's hearing tests) is a tympanic response test.  They stick a thing into the ear and there's some pressure and some beepity beepity noise and it measures how the ear drum bounces in response  to the noise. The results are on a graph and they look like a little mountain. A nice tall and thin mountain is good/normal a flat-is or misshapen mountain shows a problem.  
Your need more info from your ENT or get a second opinion. If your child isn't getting a normal/typical tympanic response test but the ENT says there's no fluid backup then what? Is it a physical anomaly or something else? How does one find out? (I don't know and I'm sorry the doctor's office is not providing this info without you having to ask) 

&gt; The ENT said they do not drain fluids even if there's fluid behind the ear drums. They let it drain naturally first. Is this true?

What country are you in? Get a second opinion!  (this is too medical for me to properly answer, but it sounds odd, my particular case was pretty severe by the time I saw my ENT as a 4-year old. )
Your son is only 6 months old you are not too late at all. 
&gt;Does hearing aid and cochlear ear work well for kids with hearing loss? Or do we need to prepare ourselves for learning sign language? I read somewhere that most people wearing hearing aid and cochlear ear choose to discontinue using them, due to discomfort or something, and that if I do not learn sign language, I may never communicate to my child. So learning sign language is a must. Is this true?

This last question is very complex but in my 45 years, I've lived most of the different scenarios.  I was born hearing, had an ear tube for drainage in one ear on two occasions as a young child, went deaf as a teen and  young adult, and recently I've gotten cochlear implants. (I literally got implanted with my 2nd one this morning. and I can't sleep right now so I can write this very long reply to your post :) ) 

So far with everything you have told us, your son has some conductive hearing loss, meaning the problem lies in the middle ear.  He will likely be a candidate for some kind of hearing aid.  Possibly a bone anchored hearing aid, which is a surgical thing he can get when he's grown, as a child he can wear a device that will work as well, or use a conventional hearing aid.  A cochlear implant may also be an option but that might be far more than what your child needs, and I can tell you that CIs are merely a treatment, not a cure and your child will still be deaf,. Not only that the process of getting a CI may cause your child to lose whatever natural hearing remains, so lots of things to consider.  

Here is the most important thing,  your child has hearing loss, and you've been on top of things as much as you can be. You're a good parent. Your child is only 6-months old so even though it might feel like they're making you wait forever on things it hasn't been all that long.  It's not too late to do the best thing you can for your child no matter what is going on with their ears: learn sign language as a family starting right now.  Please take it from me someone who was born hearing then went deaf later, sign language is so very useful and important to learn. Please give them the gift of language now to help them grow up to be the best adults they can be. Also since I learned to speak as a child, I was able to speak as a deaf adult. I assure you that being able to speak when you cannot hear is not as useful as hearing people seem to think it is. There is a strong hearing bias out there in the world but other than that it's terribly over-rated.  

I can shed a little light on what you may have heard about people who have cochlear implants.  Things have changed a lot in the last 30 years in the Deaf community when it comes to Cochlear Implants.  Part of the problem back in the day was that they were touted as a ""cure"" but that was never true. Deaf people as a community have frequently needed to fight not just for equal access and representation but also for access to their own language and communication in general.  There's a deep and rich culture in the signing Deaf community and you can understand why people would be very apprehensive of any alleged ""cure"".   There are still some people who think they're ""better"" by shunning tools like CIs but they're in the minority these days. OK, in addition to all that keep in mind that most deaf people are born to hearing families. The majority of those that are candidates for implants get them. That has increased once the FDA approved implants for young children. Now considering all that, Sign language is still extremely popular among deaf people who are lucky enough to learn it. My belief is because the CI and hearing aids in general are NOT cures, if you have a CI you're still deaf.  You mention some people choose not to wear them and that does happen, it depends on lots of factors. I once met a guy who was about my age, lost his hearing as a teen, kindof like I did and got implanted over 15 years ago but never wears them, he hates them.  I only met the guy once and can't really tell you more than that, but there are people like that.  As for myself, I was comfortable in my own skin as a deaf person having been quite deaf for over a decade before I got my first implant in late 2024.  I really like it, but I'm still deaf. I can hear better than I have in almost 30 years, but it's not useful in all situations or environments. It's useful but it's not like it was when I was a child, the sound is intelligible but it's not natural. 

So in summary, take a deep breath, you have lots and lots of time to help your child and you're being a great parent so far.  Start learning sign language right now, no matter what is going on with your child's ears. Check out r/podc it's a small but growing subreddit for people like you.  Please come back if you have other questions about being alive while deaf.  Good luck :)

1.	⁠What's the difference between a newborn hearing screening, and a ABR test?

ABR is essentially the final test for kids too young to respond to behavioral audiograms (aka click when you hear the beep). they put them to sleep how they do for surgery (simply because you MUST be still and babies do not have the capacity). electrodes are stuck on the head like stickers and ear phones play sounds into to ears. the electrodes measure the brain waves that respond to the sounds. it is objective and gives an accurate measure of hearing levels. 

typical new born hearing screenings to my knowledge include OAE. an earphone is placed in the ear to measure the health of the cochlea hairs. it is not an exact measure of hearing loss and cannot give hearing loss levels, but can be indicative of hearing loss (aka in hearing kids they tend to be present, in kids w hearing loss they tend to be reduced or absent). 

2.	⁠What comes ABR test? Is ABR test the final test that can determine the cause of hearing? Or can ABR test determine the degree of hearing? Is ABR test good enough to create a hearing aid? Is ABR test good enough to determine if he has profound deafness? Could you let me know what comes after ABR tests?

most of this i covered in my first answer, but it will be able to definitively estimate levels of hearing loss and will be the qualifier for hearing devices at this age. i believe test results are immediate. it is unlikely an ABR can determine cause to my knowledge 


3.	⁠The audiologist says there's some obstructions behind his ears, that's why his ear drums do not vibrate. But the ENT said there aren't any fluids. What other causes could there be on why his ear drums do not vibrate, on BOTH sides?

I would find out what this means. If they are talking about tympanic measures, then that screams conductive loss (aka obstruction in the middle ear, often times fixable). i have profound sensorineural hearing loss and my tymp tests are all still normal 

4.	⁠The ENT said they do not drain fluids even if there's fluid behind the ear drums. They let it drain naturally first. Is this true?

i am not sure and cant comment on this

5.	⁠My son is already 6 months old, and if it takes many more visits to figure out what's going on, let's say he gets hearing aid at 9 months old. Will he ever catch up language wise? If so, when will he catch up? Or are we too late for everything?

SIGN LANGUAGE. hearing devices can be great, but not a fix or substitute for language. 


6.	⁠Does hearing aid and cochlear ear work well for kids with hearing loss? Or do we need to prepare ourselves for learning sign language? I read somewhere that most people wearing hearing aid and cochlear ear choose to discontinue using them, due to discomfort or something, and that if I do not learn sign language, I may never communicate to my child. So learning sign language is a must. Is this true?

if you have a child with hearing loss, sign language is always a must, no matter how well devices work for them

I know how the waiting and being bounced around feels. My son was born during covid, so he didn't get newborn screening. Then once we noticed issues, it was moooonths of waiting lists, inconclusive tests in different locations, etc. The not knowing was hard. But in not knowing, I decided the obvious best thing to do was learn more sign language. I had learned some from a deaf friend, and signed with my first baby. So I put more effort into deliberately signing with this second one. 


In our case, I noticed he wasn't picking up ASL like his brother did. So I started to realize, before going into the final (conclusive) hearing test -- he had an issue with *language*, not hearing.


I'm not offering this anecdote to suggest your situation is similar. My point is more that there's no downside to learning and using ASL. Even if he's NOT deaf, the process of learning can be helpful for other reasons. And the knowledge acquired can help you make friends. You might meet a deaf kid or parent at school in the future. (Happened to us!)


You've got lots of great advice from deaf people here. But as a hearing parent with deaf friends, here's an observation I've made: Oral speech ability doesn't impact success or happiness in life. Deaf people can live great lives without speech. What has impacted some of them more, is their reading and writing skills in English. And research shows that early access and exposure to ASL, helps build literacy skills in deaf children. The Deaf people I know who signed from an early age, have excellent English writing skills. And some read and write multiple languages fluently. I knew if my son had been deaf, any amplification was going to be icing on the cake. But the cake was going to be made of ASL.


Lots of great research here:

The bulk of it:
Learning ASL is a must. Reach out to audiology for a referral to a local early intervention program. They're going to want to figure out why your child is deaf and rule out a syndrome. If they don't recommend it, you may want to ask for a CMV antibody blood test in the future. Apparently there are over 300 genes that could have mutations causing hearing loss. Those early screenings are not very good and to my understanding are just pass/fail no info. The ABR is a much better metric. Even if your kid qualifies for hearing aids or cochlear implants which is not a given, ASL is still majorly majorly beneficial. They'll probably need to do an MRI  next to see what's going on and understand both why your kid is deaf and if implants or hearing aids would even help, depending on severity and structure. ASL is something you can start learning now while you're stuck going back and forth between doctors not even knowing your options yet and worst case is you can communicate a little bit more with more people, I wish I learned ASL before my child. Also, they absolutely can drain fluid if there's extra fluid? I think it depends on the situation, like a 2 week old they'll wait to see if it drains on it's own but I know it can be drained if that's the issue and it's not resolving on its own. If you're getting the run around like I have been and they don't help you find an ASL class, try to find a school for the deaf in your region and email them. Even if they're far away, hopefully they can point you in the right direction.

I'm trying to not let this be too long but it is what it is, DM me if you want, but yeah it's been very hectic. I know how overwhelming and isolating it can feel being a parent, not because of your kid but because of all the hoops you have to learn to navigate and how hard you have to fight to get the resources you and your kid needs, plus trying to get family and friends to learn any ASL especially if they think you can just get a CI, problem solved, your kid is hearing now. No?? I sure didn't anticipate needing to learn a new language to communicate with my kid. It feels like a lot. It's so frustrating to look everywhere for resources and struggle so much to get access to them. Most things I find online are only geared towards forcing your kid to form to a hearing world and when I try to find resources on teaching my deaf kid I find mostly resources to teach hearing kids how to sign, or find videos of kids activating cochlear implants. Then I ask every specialist we've interacted with for help finding an ASL class and nothing, but they can find a speech therapist to see a 3mo with profound hearing loss?? Why?? I have so much to learn. I am not deaf or HoH  and no one on either side of the family is but our 3mo is profoundly deaf and my husband and I have been bouncing back and forth between just about every specialist it feels like, getting the run-around, and trying to do what we can for our kid and learn what we can.

Here's what our timeline has looked like. Meanwhile we're fighting with insurance BS unrelated but about to be related. Not looking forward to figure out payment plans, holy hell, but it's what we have to do. We'll absolutely go in to debt for this guy to get a fair start.

Also there are separate subreddits for ASL, cochlear implants, and PODC (parent of deaf child).

&gt; Failed 2 screenings in hospital, told it may be fluid

&gt; See pediatrician 

&gt; See pediatrician, get referrals

&gt; Failed the repeat screening at 2wo

&gt; See pediatrician

&gt; Referred to a children's audiologist

&gt; Start trying to learn ASL online, mostly through lifeprint.

&gt; Do the ABR testing and find out our LO has severe to profound hearing loss. Everything in the middle and outer ear appears and functions normal. They measure some hearing in the 95db range, symmetrical in both ears.

&gt; See pediatrician

&gt; Referred to cardiology, ENT, genetics, and ophthalmology

&gt; Get an echo and EKG

&gt; See pediatrician 

&gt; Repeat ABR testing, confirm hearing loss is the same. Take molds for hearing aids even though we're told they won't help, they're part of the process. Finally have diagnosis I can use with referral for early intervention and support

&gt; Get referred to radiology for an MRI. If the nerve is not in tact I don't think CIs are an option. Ask about CMV urine test but kid is really too old for it to show on a urine test, so we're told to ask genetics about an antibody blood test

&gt; Seek genetic counseling and decide on what tests to do. We can't afford the blood test but are doing the swab. We are told with both tests there's a 50/50 chance they find any related genetic mutations. If it's one specific one there's a trial treatment. We are also asked if we want to donate a vial of his blood whenever he has blood drawn for scientist to research the cause of his deafness, and if we would let them have a sample of tissue if there is extra during a surgery anytime in the future. The blood test we can choose to get later and would take both the parent's blood for samples and the child's and has a more in-depth panel, still a 50/50 shot of finding something. Not going for a blood test I don't know when we'll get a CMV test. I don't think it's likely in our case but yeah one of the reasons parents don't let family kids baby anywhere.

&gt; Early intervention sends someone to sign forms

&gt; Early intervention sends a coordinator to talk about needs

&gt; Get an MRI, results on the portal are normal-- still no phone call. They scheduled a follow up for when he's 6mo, but didn't call or tell us? So confused, but alright.

&gt;Early intervention is sending another person to coordinate needs. 🤷 Get told they will send info on an ASL class (been asking every person we've seen every visit and nothing. Get her email and the class is a 6w class that's already started). We're told there's a great therapist who knows ASL but she may not have availability. Our kiddo is meeting or ahead of all other milestones than hearing. He's already looking at people's hands when they gesture, trying to see what they're saying even though it's nothing. So far he likes the sign for milk and the sign for poop, starting to like the sign for cat. Maybe sort of understanding the sign for want and need and dad? He's so young he's not expected to, but his brain is sure firing away.

&gt; We get his loaner hearing aids. They seem to be malfunctioning, yay, we'll see how this goes. He doesn't appear to really react to sound except for the really loud feedback back from before programming and I think he sort of heard a bell sound I played on speaker. Ask about MRI, this is when we find out about ENT appointment and we are told most likely he is eligible for implants, but we'll talk through next visit with ENT. 

&gt; Therapist to work with son bi-weekly knows ASL and will help find people to come to our house and teach us, had no idea that would ever be an option. Also hope to find support in local communities 

&gt; Waiting for a genetic test via mail

&gt; We're scheduled to see our pediatrician
&gt; Scheduled with ophthalmologist

&gt; To be scheduled with audiology again

&gt; Scheduled with ENT

Meanwhile we're trying to keep signing basic things to our LO and I've memorized brown bear to sign to him. I hold it so he can look at the pictures while I sign behind it. Be enjoys it, he loves being signed to.

Firstly, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with teaching your child Sign ***if*** you suspect hearing loss. Trouble is you have two differing opinions. If there is fluid, it could just naturally drain; if there’s no fluid, then you need to consider other factors / conditions( ? ). It might be worth looking for a second opinion….

&gt;Does hearing aid and cochlear ear work well for kids with hearing loss? Or do we need to prepare ourselves for learning sign language?

Typically, yes, they work very well with that demographic. But honestly, you can do both; there's literally nothing stopping you from doing HA/CI and sign language, to give your kid the most amount of options.

If you choose to skip HA/CI now (well, before 5) they will never work well for the kid. So IMO, it's very irresponsible to skip that, as you're deciding that your kid will never have proper access to that.",2025-09-11 02:41:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ndxj0b/whats_the_journey_for_getting_deafness_analysis/
1nd1w0r,deaf,Amazon Silences Its Deaf Workforce by Cutting Accommodations,"Amazon is valued at over $1 trillion, yet both in its Corporate offices and its Fulfillment Centers, the company is cutting back on critical accommodations for employees with disabilities — specifically Deaf and Hard of Hearing Amazonians.

Internal communications reveal a worsening interpreter shortage that leaves employees without the support they need to fully participate in their jobs. Instead of ensuring reliable, professional interpreting services, Amazon has been pushing “virtual solutions” and low-cost equipment. These are not adequate substitutes for the accessibility services employees are entitled to under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

As a result:
	•	Deaf/Hard of Hearing employees in Corporate and in Fulfillment Centers are being denied equal access to meetings, trainings, safety briefings, and day-to-day communication.
	•	Interpreter cancellations and poor scheduling mean some employees are left without any way to communicate — putting them at risk of exclusion from critical decisions, and even safety risks in warehouse environments.
	•	Alarmingly, more Deaf Amazonians are being placed on “Focus” and “Pivot” performance plans — not because of ability, but because Amazon’s failure to provide accommodations makes it harder for them to meet performance expectations.

For a company of Amazon’s size and value, scaling back accessibility — whether in its corporate offices or fulfillment centers — is unacceptable. This practice undermines workplace equity, punishes employees with disabilities for Amazon’s own failures, and raises serious concerns about both ADA compliance and corporate accountability.

I have a deaf buddy who had worked as a programmer for Amazon over ten years ago, they already did stuff like this. He wasn't assigned interpreters in meetings at all. Amazon is the least deaf-friendly place you could hope to work at. It's a pretty disgusting company. A true example of unbridled capitalism.

I mean.... Are you surprised? They rolled back DEI..... 


I've never had the impression Amazon was deaf friendly as an employer. There's no amount of DeafNation expo booths that will ever convince me of that. 🤷🏼‍♀️

How are you shocked by this? I dont think most companies are deaf friendly unless you force them to be.

I was put on pivot | pip and was fired. I appealed that I wasn't provided interpreters on all of my 1:1 with manager even it's my responsibility to set up interpreters for meetings and 1:1. The fact I sucked at my job was irrelevant and has nothing to do with ""communication issue"". I used my deaf card and counter argument that their policies weren't applied correctly because no interpreters were provided. I understood everything what being said blah blah, but fuck em.

They had to hire me back - they was scared that I could sue based on technically that I wasn't provided with ASL interepters despite it's ""my responsibility"".

With this administration, I'm surprised they aren't rounding us up and putting us in camps. I want to know of the ice videos to put literal ice in my veins. I'm not really trying to make this political, because this really isn't the space for politics because it's so divisive, but facts are facts and this administration is not friendly to the disabled community.

When it earned them accolades, they ran commercials bragging about their inclusive practices and how great a workplace they were.    They used the deaf folks who either came to work there or believed the hype sight unseen to counter claims of employee abuse, hazardous conditions, etc.

""You had to pee in a bottle over a 14h shift with no breaks?    LOOK AT THESE HAPPY DEAF EMPLOYEES!   They say we're a good company.""     

Now, DEI is gone so why pretend?   Amazon doesn't care about any of their employees -at all- but these  deaf meat shields cost extra money, are hard to deal with and no longer serve a corporate purpose.    They can't sue us in this 'better' world and nobody would take their side, anyway.     Drop em in with the regular employees and let the system do its work.

Another story as old as time.

All large companies will do nothing they don’t have to according to the law. Laws need to change.

No place of employment is deaf friendly. 
How many deaf people do you see working retail? How many deaf doordash people have you met? How many deaf actors, congressmen, police officers, athletes? Have we ever had a deaf president? When you watch TV or a movie, how many deaf people are in the cast?  This world is not designed with deaf people in mind. I am deaf, I've personally experienced the discrimination on a daily basis. None of this post surprises me.

Fuck Amazon.

Where did you get this info? Link to an article?

Do you have proof that Deaf employees are disproportionately put on performance plans because the company is unable to accommodate appropriately? Only asking because that information would be helpful to generate a class action

I heard the boss fired a deaf employee over a broken rule one time. This deaf person asked for proof but the boss won't show it to him, no matter what.

1nc1nzp,deaf,Experiences with TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR Glasses (or Other Options) for Real-Time Captions in Healthcare Settings?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a healthcare professional with severe hearing loss (HoH). I’m looking for a practical and reliable way to get real-time captions for conversations with patients, coworkers, and in professional meetings.
I’ve been researching:
* TranscribeGlass T1
* XRAI AR 

A few questions for those who’ve tried them (or similar setups):
1. How accurate and reliable are captions in real-life noisy environments (like a pharmacy, hospital, or clinic)?
2. Which setup is more practical for all-day professional use? (comfort, battery life, charging while in use, ease of setup)
3. Has anyone compared the captioning accuracy of TranscribeGlass vs. XRAI AR?
4. Any major downsides or frustrations I should know about before investing?
5. Are there other captioning glasses you’d recommend that are better suited for healthcare workers who need quick, accurate communication with patients?

I’d love to hear from anyone—especially healthcare workers—who uses these devices daily. Your real-world experiences will help me decide which setup to invest in.

Thanks in advance!

I have been researching support available for deaf children and I came across the Disability Living Allowance. It hadn't occurred to me that my daughter might be eligible for this and it got me wondering, what could this money be used for to support her? We're fortunate in the UK that her hearing aid and consumables (eg batteries) are all covered by the NHS. Presumably this money could be put towards other things to support her? Will she need anything for school? Learning materials? Day-to-day necessities? Will we have to buy better hearing aids in the future? Just haven't really considered all this and wondered what extra support she may need that this benefit might enable.

Are there any downsides to applying for the DLA? Is it something that we would have to declare on a form in the future or something? Insurance or something? Will things like travel insurance be more expensive?

1nbxiek,deaf,Interpreter for concert,So my friend the one needing an interpreter bought tickets for us to go to a concert. They are on the side close to the stage. She can’t get floor or standing seats unless we’re right up in front standing because she is too short to see. So then she emailed the venue to request an interpreter… well the interpreter said she has to get seats in only two sections which are the seats in the upper back section behind the floor. That’s unfair because she can’t see that far either and my vision is also not very good as well. Can a venue do this to us and only limit interpreters to certain sections? I’ve never heard this. They didn’t even offer for the interpreter to be side stage and us to be right in front either.

1nagj4l,deaf,"should i request an interpreter as a HoH, ASL learner? “stealing” accommodations from someone else?","i found out i was HoH last november and since about january, have been using hearing aids. i currently use jabra power BTEs and have been learning ASL for a year now. even though i am in the mild-moderately severe loss range (cookie bite shape), i really have been struggling hard with hearing people with and without my aids, of course its better with though. i have found regardless that i prefer to use asl and my bf is learning now as well. i’m not fully fluent yet in ASL but i’ve been learning at my college and frequently use it with my partner day to day (mostly bc i prefer using it over speaking and hearing but also bc we’re both learning so good practice!) as well as attend Deaf community and ASL club events frequently!

i have been looking into tickets for twilight in concert to go to with my bf. CONTEXT: this is where u go to a concert hall, theater (not movie theater) and they play the movie while having an orchestra to do all the music live. we're both musicians and twilight is one of my favorite movie series so its a win-win! 

there are not a lot of tickets left in the theater near us but the only seats left are in the very back rows of the upper balcony. there are still some accommodation seats (not just ones for ppl w mobility issues) left though. i have been considering calling the theater to maybe request an interpreter. while i *can* hear with my hearing aids, it isn't the best even still and i will not be able to hear the movie/music from the very back without any captioning or interpreter. i will still be able to enjoy the music by watching and listening but the speaking portions i will struggle with. i don't want to take any seats away from disabled people who NEED NEED these spots but i am wondering if this could be a good option. i am in asl 3, can hold conversations and am very good at picking up signs i don't yet know with context so it's not like this would go completely unused. i know the twilight script like the back of my hand but if there are things i miss, it'd be nice to have something in front of me. i always use captioning devices at the movies as well.

1na069r,deaf,hoping for advice,"im not the most articulate, so i apologize in advance if the flow of my thoughts are unorganized.

im struggling as a HOH in 2nd yr uni. i was diagnosed 3 years ago but despite wearing hearing aids, i find it difficult to understand what people are saying unless they are at a close proximity, have good enunciation, or there is not much background noise. the last 3 years were very challenging, but i was able to survive and get by. 

since i grew up hearing, i hate to admit it, but my disability is an insecurity to me. i’ve hidden the fact that im HOH because i fear being judged and being looked at differently. only a handful of people are aware that i wear hearing aids, though my hearing problems might be obvious to some, if not, most. 

just recently, i had to advocate for myself for the very first time to my professor. we had a test earlier, but the questions were said verbally. i could not understand majority of the questions, and even asked if they could repeat one, but they refused (which i totally get), and so i made up my mind that i would talk to them after class about my situation. thankfully, they were nothing but kind and understanding and ensured that i would be accommodated for the following tests. 

today’s event made me realize how difficult im making my life be by hiding my hearing loss. i need advice on how to be more confident in speaking up/mentioning the fact that im HOH and if there’s any mindset i can have to remove my mentality that if people will know, they will judge. as i’ve mentioned, i’ve grown up hearing, and even after 3 years, im still learning and adjusting to this “new” life. i really want to embrace myself as a HOH individual because i know that it’s now a part of me, so i would really appreciate any advice.",2025-09-06 13:55:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1na069r/hoping_for_advice/

I use a fitness band like Fitbit, you can set an alarm that vibrates on your wrist. Been doing it for years. 😁

Options, as far as I know, are vibration based alarms or light based alarms or someone touching you.

I use the sunrise clock. Not for hearing loss but I find that it is less disruptive. I have the flashing lights but I always end up dreaming of police cars or worse and with the bed shaker it’s the Texas chainsaw massacre 🤔

Prefer light flash. 

Do not like vibrate sudden.

Well a few years ago in Japan someone invented an alarm that alerts you with wasabi. 
https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyle/wasabi-fire-alarm-a-lifesaver-for-the-deaf-idUST294210/

I use my Apple Watch alarm on vibrate.

I'm profoundly deaf and use my fitbit! The alarm has a vibrate function

These days I usually have my husband wake me since he’s religiously a 6am wake up person and the only times I need to be up earlier are when we both do. But when that’s not an option I’ll generally use my Apple Watch or just hope for the best lol 😂

Sleep on an alarm controlled taser?

i have this really good bed shaker that wakes me up. i’ve had it for four years and i have no issue with it. it was no more than 20 on amazon, not sure how much it is now, but it couldn’t be much more!

Having you considered applying for a Hearing Dog , Rose alerts me to all sounds my alarm clock, smoke and CM etc the list goes on.

Iwatch

I use my Samsung Fit3 and my phones reminders app for several daily alarms, getting up is one of those. Several reminder/alarms because ADHD and I need to maintain a routine.

I just use my phone. Put it on my bed instead of my nightstand, and it buzzes. But otherwise yeah the bedshaker. 

If you need to be woken up by an alarm I'd recommend the bedshaker bc the phone isnt usually strong enough to wake me up specifically, I just have a good internal clock.

I have moderate to severe hearing loss and the only alarm that works for me is on Alarmy, and the tone is Loud Alarm 6. If you still have some sense of hearing left, I’d suggest that app— I’ve never slept through it.

They have service dogs for this

I have an alarm which is extremely loud and theres a thing that you can put under your pillow/mattress that vibrates, I got it from Amazon

I have a vibrating watch that vibrates. I got a cheap one that looks like an apple watch for like $30.

I use a Whoop. It has a strong vibration.

Something that’s accessible for me (I am profoundly deaf in my left and moderately deaf in my right.) depends on the severity but I use my iPhone alarm and put it on full volume and vibrate &amp; put it inside my pillowcase when I sleep. It takes a bit for it to wake me up 🤣

For example, Rick Riordan’s Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard has really good deaf rep (Hearth) but it’s ranked really low on this, so how accurate is this person? Do deaf people generally agree with their opinions or are they just really picky/critical or what? Genuinely curious 




[댓글]
This is me! I feel like I go to great lengths to emphasize in the intro of this list that these are my own opinions: 

&gt;[I am ranking these] **based on my own understandings** (from firsthand experiences, stories written/recounted by other deaf individuals, and academic literature). No need to tell me that another deaf person has a different opinion. We are not required to share opinions.

You can read any of these books and form your own opinions about them regardless of how I rank them. That’s part of why I include the huge, unranked spreadsheet version, so people who are primarily interested in finding a book to read can do so more easily.

I'm truly confused.  You made an entirely new reddit account just to ask as a hearing person if a Deaf-run blog is ""legit"" because a Deaf reviewer had a different perspective on a Deaf character written by a hearing author than you, a hearing reader, had.

Is this the blog owner attempting self-promotion through ragebait?

Did you read her good read critique of the first two books in the series? I’m not sure what you think “really good deaf rep” qualifies as, but the first two books do not represent deafness well. It’s not “picky” to want deafness represented accurately. Especially by others with such a huge following. Seems like he got some consults/sensitivity readers for the third though.

I don’t understand what your issue is? Their reviews go pretty in depth about what wasn’t exactly accurate coming from actual deaf/Deaf experiences and you’re saying it comes across as being picky because you’re glad the character was presented as smart rather than dumb

Why would people want something mostly inaccurate that doesn’t fit in with real lived experiences just because bare minimum they didn’t make the character stupid? If you had a character described as totally blind but they literally never bumped into anything, didn’t need a cane or guide dog or any form of assistance, and acted entirely like a person who could see that would still be an annoying thing to read through and wouldn’t really feel like a blind character even if they’re presented as really kind instead of mean

But also apparently the author does way better in the third book so even the author knew there were things to improve on lol

I mean - all you give is the ranking. You think its good, they think its bad. But you don't give why.

They seem to have a lot of reasons why - having reviewed every single book. Going from the summaries;

&gt;This is book one of the trilogy, and the worst of the three. Riordan’s “ASL” is beyond atrocious, and the way he writes, through Magnus’s narrations of Hearth, can even get downright offensive. As there is too much to hash out here, refer to [my Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5375357066) for details.  
\[...\]  
This is book two of the trilogy, and is only marginally better than the first. The signing is still awful, and the inconsistent speaking-then-signing-then-speaking to the deaf character is grating. Refer to [my Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5375386860) for details.  
\[...\]  
This is book three of the trilogy, and the best of the three. Riordan proves that it is never too late to improve. He finally got some feedback on this and put some effort into writing not only Hearth, but also how the other characters interact with Hearth. For details, refer to [my Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5375409018).

That seems extremely reasonable and sounds like its coming from a person who knows what they're talking about.

I can't remember if I know who runs this blog. I might have encountered them online - and if so yeah they were Deaf and knew what they were on about. If not - then a Deaf person was speaking highly of this blog. But either way - thiiink I have heard of it before and that it is a decent blog. But my memory is hazy and I don't have the time to go through it.

Anyway - I am a bit curious - why do you think Hearth's representation was good? What points do you disagree with the blog-author on?

1n92lr4,deaf,Is Signia Run Click ITC good?,"I’ve been wearing BTE hearing aids for about 10 years, which cost me $381.16 for the pair. They recently broke, and I need new ones for school. I was planning to get ITC hearing aids, but I’m not sure which ones are good, just for context, my hearing loss is around 40 dB.

I came across the Signia Run Click ITC, which costs $408.39 for the pair. I was also considering the Siemens Insio CIC, but they cost $2,178.06, which is way out of my budget.

I’m looking for something affordable yet discreet. Has anyone had experience with the Signia Run Click ITC?

$381USD for a pair of hearing aids is dirt cheap. Go talk to your audiologist. 

\&gt; I’m looking for something .... discreet.

Sod off. you're in the wrong place if you want to hide your hearing loss.

Okay I am not familiar with this brand at all since I use Phonak custom hearing aids I got from my states vocational rehab services for free. However I do wear BTE hearing aid that are “discreet”. The way I made them “discreet” is having them match the color of my hair and have clear ear molds and hooks. This allows them to still be visible when needed, but not too much that random people would just start asking questions/ assume they are just some Bluetooth earbuds. It a color I always picked since I was in second grade as I was always the only person in my class who was Hard of Hearing and wore hearing aids. Back then kids in my class saw that as different and would point out that to me despite them being hidden. Thus, cementing the fact I shouldn’t have them stand out. Although I do have one blue ear hook right now which I don’t mind having as original broke and blue was all a local audiologist had. It was either that or risk losing my hearing aid. So idk if you can pick your own hearing aid color or not with theses, but that the only way to make them “discreet”. Other than that no way to make hearing aids “discreet”. Hope this helps.

Where are you located?

Why did you make a new account to post this question?

I haven't used this exact model, but i do use Signia brand hearing aids of a different model. I have liked them. I'm rough on my stuff and they've been quite sturdy. You will probably want to talk to your audiologist and listen to them about what would work best for your type of loss though. 

Personally, discretion is not one of the things I'd rank as important when choosing a set of hearing aids. I understand trying to avoid discrimination, but if it's reasonable for your life, consider embracing being deaf/HoH and not worrying about hiding it. Choosing a pair of aids that work best for your type of hearing loss is more important, and your audiologist can help with that. 

Good luck! I hope u find a perfect model for you! :)

Why do you care about discreet hearing aids? You shouldn't feel embarrassed about hearing loss.

Fwiw I made my HAs hot pink and it seems only Deaf people notice I have them. My doctor yesterday tried to stick an otoscope in my ear and only realised when it hit my HA that I had them.

1n8ywxq,deaf,The real utility of smart glasses.,"Hi there.  
I  was born with APD, couldn't really hear anything for most of my life, tried hearing aids for most of my life which didn't offer any aid, contrary to what it is supposed to do. I start a career in technology 2+ years ago and i have learnt the fact that they cannot really help the user if there is no way for the user to send a feedback signal, and feedback signals are important especially since hearing itself is a dynamic function. Afterwards i found myself trying to create programs that would help me use my eyes to ""see conversations"" via Machine learning live captioning.   
  
I heard about petitions conducted 7+ years ago for google glasses and how people were hyped up over the device and how much it was disappointing especially to the hearing impaired to not receive any response from the tech empire.   
  
Lately there have been projects ran by solo engineers and hobbyists who are spending their time building smart glasses with versatile functions, and those glasses find somewhat okay-ish utility for the hearing impaired, precisely in terns of live captioning. 

I would like for anybody who have actually tried one of these to provide me with a short review on which glasses they have tried and which mobile applications they are using. I really wish you could help me out on this because it took me years trying to find a solution and i couldn't really find the perfect glasses. 

Thank you, everyone.

This is a great idea! I haven’t tried any of them as I wear glasses already and haven’t looked into how to wear two pairs at once or if they’ve managed to incorporate the functionality into existing glasses. I’m bilateral CIs but there are plenty of situations where I need more help. Thanks for doing this. I’m following to learn!

I'd like to try them

I haven’t tried any yet, but what I WILL ask for, as a deaf gal who’s legally blind in her left eye &amp; low-vision in her right, is that they eventually have the ability to change &amp; personalise the font &amp; its size!!

Following! Honestly would be such a game changer. Between AI filtering what it thinks is the primary speaker (to interpret text) let's say, in a busy room, and what could be the  glasses ability to read lips (like HAL), we should totally be there already!

I'm shipping a VTT transcription app whenever the play store approves it. I'm familiar with these. I wouldn't really recommend any of them unless you have a bottomless pit of money. I'm just releasing my app for free because incorporating and marketing it would cost $ and make no sense given the complete lack of interest.

There's 3 or 4 types:

1. Cheap ""glasses"" plastic frame or attach something to glasses with a ticker and offloading all the processing to the phone using a 3rd party VTT 
2. In a similar vein the movie theatre glasses e.g. something like the sony/regal glasses with dedicated device which is where most of these got the idea from. These use actually sub files, not VTT but you can use same concept:
https://hearingreview.com/hearing-products/amplification/amplified-caption-phones/sony-and-regal-cinemas-release-open-caption-glasses-at-movie-theaters
3. VTT software or implementation of 3rd party VTT on AR (the modern multi-purpose glasses)

Almost all of them require being online or connecting to your phone. And a number monthly fees are basically inescapable if you're using 3rd party VTT. Many devices have built in VTT but its often not as good as the third party services. The mic is a limiting factor too. Getting apps approved for most of these store marketplaces is pretty nightmarish now too. Google recently made some changes to the play store and apple/ios has always been a pain.

&gt; solo engineers and hobbyists who are spending their time building smart glasses with versatile functions

Almost none of these are built by one person.

I think the AR have the best likelihood of succeeding since they'd have the largest market exposure, you don't have to develop the hardware, and most likely to have major players, but they're also least likely to be profitable for smaller players or innovative since Apple take 30% in addition to the $100/yr ($300/yr) enterprise and a bunch of other fees. Google/Android is p much the same now going into next year. And that doesn't include hardware (just the relevant hardware for these glasses so you can test will easily run to 10-20k), prototyping for dedicated, taxes and hidden fees.",2025-09-05 07:38:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n8ywxq/the_real_utility_of_smart_glasses/
1n8tpkg,deaf,Is it possible to listen to music in stereo? (OSIA Implant),"I have single sided deafness, specifically I cannot hear out of my left ear. I have the OSIA (I) implant, I was wondering if it is possible to experience digital audio in stereo with the use of headphones/bluetooth?

This question was asked on r/monohearing a while back


&gt;fsckerdot1q•3y ago
My mac allows me to join two audio channels. I join my Bluetooth headphones and my osia via the remote microphone because it uses the aux input. Works ok, goes out of sync sometimes

I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and hard-of-hearing in my left. In my phone's audio setting, there's an option for ""mono"" or ""stereo"". I set it to mono and all of the music goes to the left side. Now that I have hearing aids, it all goes to my hearing aid (which is also on the left side, obviously). I have an Oticon Real 1 Minirite BiCros hearing aid (mic on the deaf ear, receiver/aid on the HoH ear). 

That's the closest I've come to hearing anything ""in stereo"" ever.

It depends on the type of hearing loss you have. Is it sensorineural loss or conductive? And how deaf are you on the bad side?

I have snhl, the nerve doesn't work on one side. So the Osia just routes the sounds to my good ear. So all sounds are still 'mono.'

If you have conductive loss, like a busted ear drum, you may have better luck, since the Osia would be sending sound to the still-working cochlea on the bad side. 

To have stereo, you need to have both cochlea functional - not 100%, but enough for the two to be able to get left/right separately.

There's a bit of magic that happens in your head, where the brain compares the left and right inputs. Which is what makes things like binaural beats cool.  But if you're only getting input from one side, your brain can't do any of that. 

So, try it out - you might need a phone clip accessory to stream to your Osia from your phone, but you should be able to stream to it *and* a Bluetooth earbud at the same time. But it might not sound any different than if you were just streaming a mono mix. 

Does that all make sense?

I also have single sided deafness (all my life), and use a Bi-Cross heating aid set. One aid is a transmitter that is on the deaf ear. It transmits sound from that side including a receiver in the aid on the left side. It is the closest to stereo I'll ever have (short of cochlear implants).",2025-09-05 02:40:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n8tpkg/is_it_possible_to_listen_to_music_in_stereo_osia/

Headphone splitter, one output to your headphones, the other output to a device that will stream (either Bluetooth or FM) to his hearing aids. Is he doesn't have such a device already he should talk to his audiologists about getting something. They're expensive but awesome and worth the money.

Since they have Bluetooth you can start a Spotify jam. It syncs the music so you can both individually listen to the same thing at the same time ☻

I wear wired Apple earbuds by tucking them behind my hearing aid. My hearing aid is old though, and I don’t think it has Bluetooth. I’m still old school, using the T setting on my hearing aid to listen to music. 🤷‍♀️

We can feel the vibrations sound makes so touch the key. My sister, who is profoundly deaf,  puts her hands on her Bluetooth speakers.

Does your deaf partner want this? It sounds disrespectful to me. As a Deaf person when hearing try to “help me” understand what I am missing by their standards, they are not accepting that I am different.

If you go to a toy aisle focus on toys that move and are visually interesting. Not something that makes noises ( I know that seems basic, but you’d be surprised how often that happens!)

Please, search “gift” in this sub. Don’t get a gift focusing on his deafness. Get a gift that a one year will enjoy. 

As an uncle/aunt, it’s your duty to get the loudest, most obnoxious toy you can find to annoy the living daylights out of your sibling! Make sure the batteries are already installed.

Anything with lights/movement or an ASL baby book

Both my kids got Damhorst name stools.

Whatever you get instead of wrapping it, put it big gift full of ball pit plastic balls or a smaller gift bag full of plastic Mardi Gras beads. Kids that age love of sensory unwrapping

Eye See It! card game. You can play with them through the years,  finding items and teaching them the correlated signs. 🙌

My deaf son is 13 now, but I got him the same gifts I’d got my older hearing son. 

Unless there was some type of toy or game that was solely reliant on sound?

Ugh that sounds degrading. I reckon if you didn't even have a hearing loss, she would be awful about something else due to her personality that she's just shown you. Dodged a bullet there.

I'm sorry.

There's definitely decent people out there.

Adult loss here - this was a major reason my marriage ended. After 5 years my wife knew no ASL, despite years of asking and trying. Like she couldn’t even say yes or no - nothing. 

Truth is there were a lot of reasons, but this was the one that hit me the hardest, because becoming deaf was scaring the shit out of me. 

My new partner (just started dating again) has learned more sign in 6 weeks than my ex did in years. And she’s had to learn it tactile as she’s blind/low vision. ❤️❤️❤️. I found one of the good ones - they really do exist. 

Sending you complete support in your decision to end things, and wishing you good fortune in finding someone who supports you.

You did the right thing by leaving, she sounds totally self centred. What a frustrating experience, the right person won’t have a problem with speaking clearly

Sorry, you are better off without her. I am learning ASL now for my 6-month-old son.

I’m planning to go no contact with my family after I’ll someday be moving outside home for similar reasons.

Not very many people can tolerate another person's deafness. I'm 63, deaf all my life, and I can count all the friends I ever had on one hand. I am married, but it is a DAILY struggle to have meaningful conversations. The shorter we communicate the better it is. Don't give up, just don't expect a serious relationship from anyone. When you meet someone, tell them right up front you are deaf, most people will get that weird look on their face, like you are a science experiment or something. But, if you meet a cool person, that asks you what works for you to communicate with you, that's the diamond in the rough. The one that just might work out, and be worth putting some time and effort into. I hope it works out for you.

1n7pwta,deaf,"I can hear and understand my partner, but not others…","Title says it all, wondering if others have this experience. 

I’m newly profoundly deaf, with rapidly progressing deafness. I made an intentional effort to learn the sound of her voice while I still had some hearing that worked, and today, in a quiet room, I can still pick her voice up and understand her (with a good bit of lip reading). 

I love it, but it seems weird to be able to “hear” this one person when most voices just blend onto a bunch of static noise. 

Curious if this is a normal type experience.

(For the record, though I do know some ASL I’ll be going forward with CI’s too - I’m 62 and will always have a hearing mind. And my partner is blind low vision, so sign is a one directional thing, though we are working on tactile communication too for the just in case bits).

The brain preserves sound memory and that’s why it’s clearer. It’s filling in the blanks in your hearing for you.

It’s the same concept as when you get CIs: you know your voice soonest usually because you’re used to it. I’m the same with my partner, with BSSNHL due to Synaptopathy/IHC loss. I have to read lips sometimes but I can pickup around 40% of what he says (anyone else without lip reading is 11/12/17%).

My hearing level (or lack thereof) has been pretty stable for most of my life, but whenever I have worse days (ear infections, ear wax buildup etc) I can mostly hear my husband (especially since we have lots of fairly predictable social script convos due to our neurodivergent brains) without my HAs but have no chance of hearing anyone else unless I put them on.

I have this too- but my hearing loss was as an adult and SSNHL. I think it’s because of years of being attuned to his voice but he’s also really loud and his voice projects. He also is very sensitive to my hearing loss so he makes sure he’s facing me when he’s speaking - other people mumble, face the other direction or cover their mouths! 
In crowds he has to “translate” a lot for me and I think other people find it strange. IDC

Ask your doctor. They should be the one to tell you that. 

As for your second question as long as they're bluetooth connectable yes

I think this can only be answered by your audiologist

Bluetooth ones should enable you to hear music without headphones

Do you know your level of hearing loss approximately? We can’t know if you’ll hear music again.

Costco brand

There are many factors when choosing a hearing aid. You can certainly try to listen to music again but we can't promise you'll enjoy it.   If you're American, Costco is the best/most economical place for hearing aids. However if you're a US veteran, the VA should be better still. Also if you find an audiologist that you feel really listens to you and is awesome stick with them, even if you have to pay a little more.  A good audiologist can be hard to find and it makes a huge difference.

1n773j2,deaf,CODA… and HH? Am I HH??,"So I’m a CODA and have identified as hearing my whole life. I’ve always struggled with understanding people/processing what they’re saying/miss things that happen because I didn’t respond to auditory cues that were apparently there.  ASL is my first language and I understand it much better. 

Wayyy back in 3rd grade (this was my first year in public school, I was homeschooled prior), I complained about not being able to hear my teacher from a seat that wasn’t particularly far away. 

I get referred to a peds audiologist. They do testing of some kind that I don’t remember. I do remember the audiologist calling me a liar and saying I was making up hearing difficulty for attention. I cried and my mom was very angry with them, cause she didn’t think I was. 
Later that year, I was diagnosed with ADHD and all my hearing problems were chalked up to an auditory processing disorder. And maybe that’s all it is, idk. 

So TODAY I was in a college class taught in ASL by a Deaf professor. Most of the other students are hearing. There was a woodpecker at the window and everyone turned to look at it, I gather. I was watching the teacher and didn’t notice until someone explained to her what was happening and pointed to where the bird was. Everyone is saying they can hear it. And I said wait you can hear something?? Again everyone says yes. It’s unanimous. And I guess so obvious to them that someone asks me if I’m HH. I tell them I don’t think so? 

Anyway. Been processing this and wondering what it might be. I don’t feel like I’m hearing any less? Maybe I am hearing less? I’ve got no clue. But today was the first time I experienced something that couldn’t be easily blamed on the ADHD. 

Does ADHD make you not hear things? Like people speak to you and when you notice they say “I’ve been talking to you!!” And you had no idea? Is that common? …I’m going to sleep. 


[댓글]
audio processing disorder is common with ADHD. but really you should go get an audiogram done to see if you have hearing loss!

Go to a proper audiologist and have the hearing tested. It’s quite possible you had some mild hearing loss that a screening didn’t really catch well, and that with time some frequencies have been affected more. You have nothing to loose by testing your hearing again.

&gt;Been processing this and wondering what it might be. I don’t feel like I’m hearing any less? Maybe I am hearing less? I’ve got no clue.

There is a relatively simple way to find out - go to your doctor and say ""I believe I might have hearing loss - can you test me please?""

&gt;Does ADHD make you not hear things? Like people speak to you and when you notice they say “I’ve been talking to you!!” And you had no idea? Is that common?

Kinda - but afaik it's less that you do not hear but that you do not understand what is heard. The sound is still heard, just not processed.

Being *unable* to hear a woodpecker - which (afaik) is usually quite loud even if decently far away is... indicative of medically diagnosable hearing loss.

You can’t just say you’re hard of hearing with zero diagnosis though? Go see a doctor?

I have ADHD  all my life. I was diagnosed in 2nd grade. 
I also recently was diagnosed with hearing loss.

Go get tested. It could be APD…. APD isn’t always selective for only language…. Though awareness of a sound should enable you to sort of search through the sounds you hear and find that sound even if you don’t 100% understand it, so it seems like it’s probably time to get your hearing checked again.

There’s also some evidence that APD should be divided into subtypes. Out of the proposed subtypes, some of the less common ones can explain this. (An audiologist with specializes in APD should be able to help you with training to bring this back onto your radar if that is the case. Honestly, it sucks that it sounds like you weren’t really offered much in the way of therapies for APD.)

Some genetic Deaf genes can have variable expression meaning you can have the gene and not be born Deaf but you might loose hearing later on or be born only mildly hard of hearing while other family members are profoundly deaf.

At that point though, you’d have the experience of growing up a CODA and becoming DoD.",2025-09-03 06:08:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n773j2/coda_and_hh_am_i_hh/

Assuming you are in the US, you can also check to see what your state's vocational rehab office has to offer. Every state has one but services will vary. Texas offers free college tuition for deaf/hard of hearing residents, but you need to ask for it. Texas Workforce Commision won't talk to anyone under 18. Other states work differently.

I wasn’t deaf/HOH when graduated high school almost 30 years ago but there was a lot of unclaimed grants i took advantage of. Small 200 person graduating didn’t have anyone applying for the grants in Alaskans pursuing teaching, potential priests and Native American doctors so i applied for all of those and got them along with lacrosse scholarship. It obviously sounds weird and obtuse but i was awarded all of those grants and got attend college without a financial burden

I had a full Vocational Rehab scholarship to undergrad that paid  for literally everything for the entire time I was in undergrad.  That was 30 years ago so I'm old.  I'm not sure if they're of the same capacity as they were then.

I would start with the resources at your school; the counselors likely know of local scholarships with lower competition.

Looking at this chart, it says no Bluetooth, but it also says there is an app that you can use with it, and it works with the wireless accessories. So that seems conflicting. However, it does show you need an adapter to use with a Roger Microphone.

1n6unqv,deaf,Question about Accessibility for Video Platforms,"Accessibility question for folks who are deaf/HoH: 

When you are watching content on YouTube (or any other video platform) do you prefer that the creator adds captions, so they are already visible without any effort — or do you prefer using the app-based closed caption option? 
What are the pros/cons? 

I’m really open to any/all feedback. I want to make sure my content is created with all viewers in mind. 

(My assumption is that manually added captions might be more accurate, but I also know not everyone proofreads. 😊)

Thanks in advance for your input! 🙏


[댓글]
App based allows the viewer to customise the appearance of captions (assuming the app allows this), which is in itself an accessibility point. For example, viewers who need larger captions or different colours to see them better.

But app based is not to be confused with automatic captions (or craptions https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/craptions/).

High quality, accurate captions need to be prepared and reviewed.

I prefer that the creator adds captions as they will usually be more accurate. 

However, auto captions have gotten to be very very good to the point where I will use them all the time of the video has no captions

Prefer the creator adds captions, because app-based captions are never accurate and often outright incorrect. As some have noted already though, app-based are better than no captions whatsoever.  And any and all captions should never be placed over existing text in the video (such as descriptions).

""App based"" captions can be auto generated, or manually entered, or auto generated and then edited. They will all show up as an option under the CC button, but vary in terms of quality. Captions that are burned in to the display can also be generated in different ways. So the distinction between auto generated and person generated is not the same as the difference between closed captions (that can be turned on/off) and open captions or subtitles (that are always on the video and can't be turned off)

To get better quality closed captions, you can add your own captions to YouTube, or edit auto-generated captions within YouTube and save them. This is more accessible in general than burned-in captions because deafblind people may not be able to read captions that are burned in, some people may want different size or background colors, etc.. It also generated a more accurate transcript.

In YouTube, the options for captions are available after you've uploaded a video and it has finished processing. You can edit them within YouTube or if you have a file that was created somewhere else you can upload it there. You can also add multiple channels (simple English, Spanish, etc) that people can choose from when they watch it.

You can’t be serious with this question. Of course correct manual captions are best. It’s almost only those that are usable at all. If you ever see someone who uploads incorrect captioning, report them or something. It’s really harmful if that happens and people like you start to assume it’s ok.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

YouTube has captions and I use that but if a video doesn't have any captions I use my computer  captions.

Thanks to all for your feedback &amp; insights! I really appreciate it. 🙏

As several people have already said, the captions should be creator added, but in my opinion they should use the inbuilt caption editor on YouTube (and most other platforms) because that way people can turn them on and off by choice, as well as typically adjust size/color etc. I will always choose open captions (embedded in the video, typically manually checked) over auto-generated “app based” closed captions. But ideally they should be edited closed captions for the most accessible option imo.

Auto captions are getting waaaaay better but my sister always points out mistakes still. When the creator adds them they're more right esp with names and other details. The effort to push the button is NBD and im so blessed it exists when I was little i remember captions on TV being horrible and YouTube not having automation which sucked. But its still better when whoever made the video does it because they're way more likely to be right if that makes sense. ♡

Auto captions are getting better but I'll always turn off auto if full manual captions or subtitles are added. Nothing worse than these videos starting with manual and cut off dead or popping up at the same time intermittently during auto. Either all or none at all is my preference

Automated captions tend to be hit or miss. Sometimes they're surprisingly good and sometimes they get half the words wrong. Human-created captions are almost always better.

I always prefer the content creator make their own because the AI doesnt do well enough. they basically 'voice to text' some words, and dont always do punctuation well. craptions suck and have always sucked. Just make sure your captions dont cover important stuff, and that your captions themselves are not covered by the app doing stuff like hashtags. I stopped watching TikTok and reels years ago bc people weren't captioning them right. they'd be completely covered by the 30 different hashtags while they speak so fast and their captions move along too fast to read. (babes, I want to care, but you're gonna have to put your activism in text, too.)

please, dont do jokes or paraphrase when you caption your content. word-for-word. do sound effects like '*paper rustling*' when it happens. give us the song title and artist, not just '[music plays]'. that's what we ask for in captions. we want to experience the world, not the cut-abridged version the ableist hearing people think we should get.

I use the auto captions on youtube.  If doesn't have any, I'll watch it on google chrome and use the live captions.  It's extremely accurate, and extremely free.

I use the cc on videos. If none are available, I use Live Transcribe (which came with my Android phone) and adjust to see video and read audio.

1n5gio6,deaf,Advice About Deaf Roommate,"Hi! I'm not hard of hearing, however, my best friend/ roommate is and I'm looking for a little bit of advice. 


My friend was born deaf in one ear, and has frequent ear infections in their other ear which they say is worsening their overall hearing over the years. I have done my best to support them through this, by helping them out in their ear drops and such as needed, and speaking louder for them so they can hear me. 


From the beginning, they have always hated seeing their audiologist about their hearing, for any reason. This extends to their primary doctor as well, the one that doesn't specialise in hearing. My friend has a history of depression and issues of taking care of themself, so usually it is their mom and through the encouragement and lightly pushing of myself that they make and go to those appointments.


The last time they saw their audiologist, they were able to get hearing aids, which they seemed excited for, and were given a new dose of nightly ear drops. They were told that they needed to keep on top of their ear infections, otherwise they could have serious complications and increase their chances of going deaf in their hearing ear even quicker. 


I thought me and my friend were on the same page about staying on top of this, and with the hearing aids, things seemed to be looking up for them. One of their biggest fears was losing their hearing entirely, since they said they didn't want to learn sign language and didn't want to lose their ability to listen to music in the same way that they do now, so this all seemed good, no? Well, not quite. 


Their last appointment was over a year ago, and on top of not wearing their hearing aids hardly at all, their hearing has only gotten worse. I try to speak as loudly as I can so they can hear me, at their request, but reccently it's gotten harder for me to do that consistently due to my sore throat from taking testosterone to transition, and it's seemingly put a strain on their relationship with their mother, who tells them to just wear their hearing aids. They don't wish to learn sign language or other forms of non-speaking communication either, and get mad at the idea.


I've spoken to my friend about these issues, and they have said they just can't understand why everyone can't just talk louder for them, that they are considering just wearing noise cancelling headphones everywhere, and that they don't want to wear their hearing aids because they don't want to make the doctor's appointment to get custome fittings for them to fit in their ears more comfortably.


I want to be there for them, I just don't know how. They come to me to vent about how much it sucks for them to be deaf and about how their ears have started ringing and they don't know what to do to fix it, and honestly, I don't know either. They get mad at me for suggesting to see their doctor again. I'll never know what it's like for them because I'm not hard of hearing, I don't face the same experiences as they do, so I was hoping that maybe by making this post, someone can maybe give me some advice on how to best help them, even just a little bit. 


I'm not well educated on this,  although I am doing my best to change that, and hopefully someone who knows far more than me can share some wisdom. I love them very much and just want to be there for them in a better, more knowing, way.",2025-09-01 05:40:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n5gio6/advice_about_deaf_roommate/

Editor here.

You've done an excellent job capturing the characters experiences in your writing. You also have a clear message for the reader.


To begin revising your story for publication, I recommend choosing whether you would like this to be a short story or an essay, then reading some published pieces, and trying to mimic how they are written using your ideas. This will be a good way to make sure your writing matches what publishers are looking for.


A short story is a made-up (fictional) story about a particular moment in time. What editors look for is that a conflict arises in the life of the character and changes them somehow by the end. One way to do this with your story would be to decide on a particular moment where everything changed for the character and use that as a base. Then, you can include flashbacks of earlier experiences to illustrate how the character got there.


A good example from Deaf lit is the story ""Feast"" by Ross Showalter
https://therumpus.net/2022/06/06/rumpus-original-fiction-feast/


An essay can also be a story, but is typically true and often based on the writers experiences. It tells a story to illustrate the point that the author is trying to make, and sometimes instructs the reader to do something at the end. 


A good example from Deaf lit is ""Deaf Rage,"" also by Ross Showalter
 https://www.craftliterary.com/2022/07/27/deaf-rage-ross-showalter/



Once your ideas fit into the form of your choice, you can start looking for publications. I find chillsubs.com to be a great place for checking out different magazines and journals to submit to.

1n4g754,deaf,Any tech hints for helping a newly deaf person regarding accessibility?,"Hi! My lovely dad has been rapidly losing his hearing due to a degenerative condition. The swiftness of the transition from hearing to almost completely deaf is causing him some issues regarding adapting to general life but mostly work. He has hearing aids but pretty standard ones and they don’t help with everything. I don’t think they’re digital, but would appreciate some insight into this option too- are they worth it? Can they be used with CarPlay as he can’t listen to music properly any more and has expressed missing it? 

We’ve figured out how to get live captions on Teams, but I found that by accident, and I’m sure there are loads more things I could be doing to make his life easier via the tech he uses on a regular basis (Mac/iphone). If anyone has any helpful tips I’d really appreciate it, he’s a wonderful person and it’s hard seeing him struggle with work when he’s always been a high achiever. Whilst discrimination legally isn’t a thing, I think we are all aware that there are opportunities missed due to the world being fairly inconsiderate of hearing loss (myself included prior to this, which is why I’m trying to educate myself). 

Also would really just appreciate any advice you could give for a family who is new to this world as I’d like to be as supportive as possible but mostly just feel a bit useless at this point. 

Many thanks in advance x

nagish has been my favorite for phone calls!! learning ASL should definitely become a priority so interpreters become an option and he never goes without language, as all technology can fail. learning sign as a family would be the biggest way to support. find your local deaf community and get involved! to help in the meantime, make sure you are facing him when you speak and dont speak to fast. make sure it is well lit as well

I’m not sure where you’re located, but if in the US you can reach out to your state’s Vocational Rehab office who can connect you with resources to use at work and elsewhere depending on what you need help with. I had sudden bilateral hearing loss, and I had a consult with an assistive tech specialist who helped me more than my audiologist. 

I got a Roger On microphone through the department (for free since I am on disability) and it comes with a microphone for speakers/presenters to wear and it streams to my CI, it can sit on a table to help in work meeting with multiple speakers, it can stream audio from my laptop and came with a TV streamer. 

I also got connected to college level ASL classes and have just started my class, which is going great.

That being said, audiologist might be a good place to start as well. They can help you more tech and specifically with using all of the settings available on his current or future hearing aids.

Digital hearing aids have been the norm for around 20 years. Maybe you mean Bluetooth compatible?


Getting more sophisticated hearing aids might be a good idea, it's worth exploring. If you're budget conscious and in the USA Costco is the best bang for your buck. Wireless compatibility and/or Bluetooth can be great. You'll be able to pair a smartphone or compatible microphone and have one on one conversations with your voice piped directly to his hearing aids. (I can't promise he'd still enjoy music but streaming via Bluetooth direct from his iphone will be his best bet.)


One comment mentioned Nagish, I've not used it myself but it's supposed to be good. For phonecalls I use an app/service called InnoCaption, it's my favorite captioned phone service. 


For in person communication otter.ai is one of the best apps for live captioning on iPhone. On Android there's a free app from Google called live transcribe, it's not perfect but pretty nice, and helpful. It might be worth while to buy a refurbished or budget Android phone and just use it for that, on Wi-Fi. 


Ask if you have more questions!

He can join the Association of Late-Deafened Adults(ALDA) [Alda.org](http://Alda.org)  That should have more information for his situation.

Windows 11 has a built-in feature called Live Captions. It’s not perfect, but it does a pretty good job and I like it more than the Teams captioning feature. Macs and iPhones also have Live Captions, found in the accessibility settings.

The world isn’t opposing us on purpose, it’s just that people take speech so much for granted and as the norm for communication.

Your father should remember that he is the same person and has the same competence as before, and that it’s only the hearing that has changed. He will need all his creativity to find ways to do things differently and then to convince people around him it’s ok to do so.

Yes, I use my hearing aids with CarPlay all the time. I mean I stream from my phone while having it connected through cable to the CarPlay. (The phone and hearing aids need the Bluetooth to communicate, so the car and phone need to use cable). On the iPhone, you can select wether the sound should go to the hearing aids or to the car speakers. It’s a bit hard to find the setting though. When listening to something, open the menu by dragging from the top right corner, then there is a small circle to press on to show sound output options.

Your father should meet other Deaf/HoH to find role models and to exchange experiences and tips.

You and the family should learn sign language, regardless wether your father wants it or not. Learning to sign will teach you so much about deafness, that your father’s quality of life definitely will increase due to it. Tell him not to be afraid of trying, and that he’s, it’s worth learning even for adults. None of you will become native like signers, but it will still make a difference.

Automatic transcription isn’t very great, but must look for it anywhere. Zoom, Teams and any meeting platform has them, just learn more about what’s needed to activate them. There are all sorts of apps too. Microsoft Translator has decent transcription. (I’ve never seen a less user friendly interface, but nonetheless. 

Don’t forget that anyone who doesn’t sign yet, and can’t use an interpreter, can use live captioning instead. A person comes with a keyboard and types what people are saying. It’s an absolutely brilliant service.

What country do you live in?

Just to share a little bit of hope, i started losing hearing around 20 and its just about all gone now (im 25). pretty much felt like my life was over. i was a junior in college and didnt know enough ASL and couldnt understand enough english. its a frustrating spot to be and can feel so isolating. 

things that made all of the difference for me was just effort and thoughtfulness. sitting at a table with everyone talking and having no idea what is happening is awful, but be the person that checks in and do your best to include them. a hard of hearing friend noticed i had kind of zoned out the other day during a group convo i couldnt hear and asked me if i was okay. that has honestly never happened to me and even just that simple check in meant a lot to me. 

learning ASL and involving myself in the community is the best thing i did for myself. im working towards my BCBA and have worked in schools with kids since i was 19. losing my hearing was so scary and thought my career was over. flash forward to now, i just started at a Deaf elementary school and its incredible. ive never been in a space where my access was built in and its honestly very surreal. it makes me realize that my career is far from over, but also honestly has been enriched so so much. 

at this point, i wouldnt change anything. grief is natural and honestly necessary as a late Deaf person, but there are also so many things to look forward to. you have this opportunity to be a part of an amazing culture and community (family included). you have an opportunity to connect with people who know exactly what you are going through in such a deeper way. you can literally turn your ears off whenever you want which is one of my favorite things lol, some sounds are so annoying! 

Just know, being Deaf can enrich your life if you let it :) I am sure he will learn what he needs as well, just make sure you listen

Are you comfortable by using an interpreter? If so, you could use sign and let the interpreter voice your signing

Have you considered using (automated) text to speech via computer? An interpreter would probably be ideal but not always the most prudent option.

So she’s “willing” to do what she by law has to do?

They legally have to provide you an interpreter, they know they have to provide the interpreter at their expense, let them know that you will contact the title IX office if your request isn't granted. Then follow through if your request isn't granted. They are in violation of the law.

Hey OP! Interpreter here to share info that I hope will help.

1) First, so you know - you have the right to all these accommodations. Obviously this professor I making it A Thing, but it really should not be. Your right to reasonable accommodations are protected by one of the strongest disability rights laws in the world and, theoretically, this professors actions could get their college into a lot of expensive legal trouble. 

It’s worth remembering too anytime you talk about this abelist Professor and this problem because it can make a real difference in “getting through” to the people you’re talking with. This professor is not just *saying no to a favor you asked*, they are **denying and violating your fundamental rights.**

2) If you haven’t already, go back to your DSS office and inform them that one of your professors is denying your college-approved request for reasonable accommodations. 

Any competent office should have procedures in place for how to address these kinds of cases. If they don’t know what to do, or are just assholes and respond with “well what do you want us to do about it, it’s Professor Dickheads classroom,” respond with something along the lines of: “I am a paying student of this college, being **discriminated against on the basis of my disability**, I expect you to do you job and address the situation by x or y” (where x and y are actions you want the office to take.) also mention that if you are staying in this class for the semester that you are concerned about **retaliation** (use the bolder phrases exactly, as they have specific legal definitions

3) Some tips for requesting an interpreter! Again, it shouldn’t be an issue to say “I want an ASL/English interpreter to interpret this class because I’m more comfortable expressing myself in ASL,”. But, because this professor is making it an issue, here we are. 

A) To be extra persuasive go through this Dickhead Professor’s syllabus and/or the college’s promo material and pull direct quotes to support your points in meetings with DSS/Professor Dickhead.

B) Whatever kind of class this is, if it involves a lot “oral communication in group settings”, then I assume it’s a class for you and your college-age peers to learn about a topic and then practice using that knowledge and, hopefully, help each other improve over time. It seems the college thinks it’s important if they made it a required class. And you want to learn this skill! You want to participate! …in your preferred language- American Sign Language. If college is about preparing minds for the future, well your future (as far as they are concerned,) is happening in ASL.

C) Another point you could raise, if you feel comfortable doing so, is about your deaf accent - you mentioned that multiple people have told you they struggled to understand your speech? Well, make the point to the Professor/DSS that having an interpreter would be for their benefit as much as yours - how are you and your peers supposed to communicate? How will the Professor assess your class participation and communication skills if your professor and peers are struggling to understand your speech? Much better to stick a couple interpreters in there and then you can focus on mastering the actual topic - being persuasive or demonstrating leadership or whatever. 

D) if there is any kind of group work at all, how is that actually supposed to work with a FM system? Or with a CART interpreter? What about out of class group work? Most professors don’t have any experience actually using accessibility equipment (and unfortunately many in DSS offices either,) so assert your expertise here. You know how classrooms work, you want to participate, you want to learn, you want to practice, like your hearing peers! This professor is saying captions on in class media and an fm system is equal to any hearing students experience? You and I know it’s not. This professor may just be ignorant, in which case here is where you go through and explain that actually, autocaptions aren’t good enough, or, “no, one person miced into an fm system doesn’t help if an entire 30 person classroom is full of people talking simultaneously,” 

Again it really sucks that you have to deal with this - I hope your DSS office learns about this and reads Professor the riot act.

College for me professor inform I do not speak. 

Capable speak, yes, do speak, no. 

Part accommodation for interpreter. 

Believe say private college.

Private college not require provide interpreter do not think (private college I attend not require).

Ask professor use email how can together work situation best everyone.

This is a very last resort option; but I have done this in the past.
If your university has the opportunity to take this class from a different professor, you may be able to drop the class and switch.
I had a class once with a professor who refused to allow my interpreters to be seen during dark presentations. (Think movie screenings, this was a video class)
so I dropped the class and lucked out and the professor left that year.
No clue if this is a gen ed course, or what, but this is a technique that has worked out for me personally.

«willing to accommodate» I hate this shit. There is law. You must stand up for yourself. Really, I completely understand you with the speaking aspect especially. In my experience sometimes you need to terrorise this disability office until they do something.

If I understood rightly you can speak, but feel  pretty aweful cause of the deaf accent. I think there may be some anxiety issue, other adults will get used to your accent and most know the struggle It means for you, many people have disabilities to some degree, sometimes invisible to others but they're there. If you can't handle It, say so clearly with arguments so they can understand It better.

1n42odv,deaf,Sudden Deaf,"Last Sunday, I woke up unable to hear anything out of my right ear. Within a very short time, I went from having a sensation of water in my ear canal on Saturday to being completely deaf in my right ear.

I immediately went to the hospital, where they performed an audiogram and diagnosed me with hearing loss of over 80 dB across the entire spectrum.
Three days of high-dose cortisone followed, but it didn't yield any positive results. Two days ago, I had emergency surgery to seal my inner ear because the doctors didn't know what else to do. Now, I'm on my way to potentially recover in 3-12 months.

It's all so much in such a short time. I don't know how to cope in loud environments.

What are some good steps for adjusting to this new way of hearing? Do you have any tips or ways you managed to handle it?

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this post. I'm just not sure where else to post it. 

Thank you for reading my post! :)

\&gt; Sorry if this isn't the right place for this post. I'm just not sure where else to post it.

You're in the right place, this is where you want to ask questions about being alive while deaf. 

What country are you in?  Can you tell us more about the surgery you had? I'm not familiar with what you are describing.  Maybe it's a language issue if English isn't your first language and there's another way to describe it?

I'm sorry that you didn't get better results from the cortisone.  Steroids via injection or pill form are a common emergency treatment for sudden hearing loss, it's not fully understood why it helps but it needs to be done as soon as possible. You did the right thing by going to the doctor as soon as you could. 

\&gt; What are some good steps for adjusting to this new way of hearing? 

It takes time, I lost my hearing slowly (over 5 years in one ear about 15 years in the other) as a young person. The faster you lose your hearing the more jarring it is, but you can adapt. In the future you may be eligible for a hearing aid or hearing implant depending on your specific pathology. 

You will get frustrated and the people around you will also get frustrated, be patient with them if you can but also be direct and remind them whenever necessary about your new reality. Don't go looking for pity, just be honest with them.  A very common part of the deaf experience is that people will show their true selves to you more quickly, you may lose friends but they were worth losing. 

Do I understand correctly that you still can hear well with your left ear? When I was in my 20s that was my life. I had gone completely deaf (100% hearing loss) on the left side and my right ear was mostly good. So it's not fun but it won't affect your quality of life as much as having loss in both ears.  Check out /monohearing there's lots of people in your situation. 

Good luck! ask if you have specific questions.

As a deaf person, I've got sudden hearing loss a few times but it took me at least 2-3 weeks that I could hear again with my hearing aids. 

You'll be okay, don't worry. Usually stress is one of the causes for sudden hearing losses so it'd be a good time to reevaluate whether you have been stressed recently or exposed to loud noises often or whether anything else is okay health-wise.

I deadass forgot that pens made noise.

I went 2 years without them.  They broke.  I was too poor to fix.  I doubt my left ear will get used to wearing them at the ""target"" volume.  

My skin makes sound rubbing against itself?  My breathing makes sounds?  Just sitting still not moving and my beard makes sounds? 

I enjoy it in short bursts but just existing is maddeningly loud.

I happily stopped using mine a few years ago. I don't miss the noise. I couldn't hear much with them in by then anyway. I do forgot things makes sounds and there are many sounds that even with them in I had never heard. Most things I'm only aware they make sound because my hearing wife is annoyed by it. Yep, not bothering me.

This post made my brain hurt.

I am Deaf one ear HoH in other. I also have Autism so if what i hear is too loud or too unclear it gets frustrating. I take hearing breaks when I need to.

A coworker, not to long ago made a snarky comment when I said i couldnt do a specific position because im hard of hearing and cant hear well, ""well aren't we all a little deaf"" even after i exolained I wasn't using an expression I'm medically disabled in some parts of my life she kept that whole facade and that's when I knew we wouldn't be on good terms.

I recently found out she's been mocking me to our other coworkers and making jokes about me, I have many other medical issues and its taken a lot of work for me to feel confident enough to be back at work, and I've done a lot to advocate for myself as well!

I want to bring it up with a manager or someone who can help figure this out but i dont think id be able to work along side her, as shes also jsut rude and passive agress with me in general, but i need my job so im not sure what to do or how to move forward!

Any advice is appreciated:D

Update- (for context I'm working in fast food) I talked to a shift manager and today I'm tlaking to the general manager and they'll be addressing what they can but have told me if needed they will talk with about reporting her to HR if the issues aren't reserved after they talk eith her! Thanks for the support and advice:))

First document everything you see and experience. Days, times, who said what, and where.

Then tell your immediate supervisor. Decide what you will accept as a resolution. If the manager tells her to knock it off and it stops, is that an acceptable resolution to you?

If it continues or you don't get the resolution you want, go to HR.

Ugh is no one else telling her to fucking stop when she is joking about your disability behind your back? So many spineless adults

Document it and stop it in it's tracks. You need to stop it now before it gets worse.

does your company have an HR department? 

skip the manager, go to HR.

I’m sorry you are dealing with this!

Document, document document, then go up the chain of command.

Please don’t leave everything to HR. HR protects the company, not you. Document, document, document. All conversations. All actions taken, etc.

Yes. I had good enough. If you don’t like your old job, You could move to another job. Maybe, HR made old friends at work and your HOH is still labeled as deafening. You should file or call the lawyer against HR ignoring you as important deaf culture.

If you're in the UK, this is a clear breach of section 6, Equality Act 2010. Regardless of any individuals comments, it's the company's responsibility to take care of you. I'm also hard of hearing.

1n3a1jf,deaf,Would it be respectful for a hearing person to start a sign language club?,"I am a hearing person, who is thinking about starting a sign language/Deaf community awareness club at my university. I have been taking sign language classes for about two years now and will be going into interpreter training. My goal is to create a space for hearing and Deaf/HoH students to connect, students to learn sign together, raise awareness of Deaf culture, and promote inclusivity. The thing is, I want to make sure the club is run in the *most respectful way possible*, with input and involvement from Deaf/HoH community members. 

There is a Deaf staff member who will be speaking with to be see if they think the club would be a good idea, and to be a part of it, but so far, they are the only person I know who is a member of the community on campus. My hope is also for Deaf people to eventually take leadership if they’re interested. So I guess my question is, how do members of the Deaf/HoH community feel about a hearing person starting a sign language club, and how do I ensure that it is respectful and not overstepping?

I’d really appreciate any perspectives, advice, or experiences you’re willing to share. I'm also open to correction if people think this isn’t a good idea. 

[댓글]
I think it’s great, the key here is that if there is a Deaf person or someone more knowledgeable then it’s better if they take leadership and you remain respectful and cautious about what information you share.

Definitely talk with the Deaf staff member, see if they might want to sponsor the club and listen to what they have to say - while I might be okay with it, they may not, they’ll have far more insight on your local community and values than I do.

This is just a general information - It’s important to remember you shouldn’t teach sign when you aren’t fluent, but it’s perfectly fine to practice and use sign together.

Purpose is what?

Past attend Deaf Club local community college. 

When attend, everyone speak not use ASL. 

Ask leader purpose for club and leader not understand ASL. 

Think ASL club great idea. 

Also think purpose important.

It’s fine, but be mindful that practicing with non fluent signers can lead to development of bad habits.

It says a lot you're already planning yourself as a place holder leader of the club B4 a Deaf person can take over ""if they're interested."" 

Idk take your questions and proposals to the staff member you're meeting with. Get real world feedback and stop fishing for a mythical ""Deaf community stamp of approval"" here on the subreddit.

Sure, as long as members of the deaf community are involved in the creation of the sign language club. You as a hearing person, do not have the authority, the lived experience, or their cultural knowledge to create a sign language club. Why not have a deaf person create the club and you could join it? I'm always hesitant when I see these questions because inevitably it leads to a hearing person taking control of deaf owned spaces.

1n38pg0,deaf,Personal auto captioning microphone,"hi 
I’m currently a college student and I have some classes where I am not given any captioning because the schools resources are spread really thin. I was hoping to so if anyone knows of any microphones that I could get that also do auto captions? It’s hard for me to keep up and I am looking to try and make it easier for myself. I am located in the US btw 

EDIT please stop telling me to sue my school and giving me legal advice that’s not what I’m asking nor will I have the time or money to pursue that as a full time college student 

[댓글]
In the United States, they still have to provide the service. They'll find the resources, believe me. Your proper accessibility needs are much, much cheaper than a lawyer.

You almost certainly won't find a microphone with captions. Instead look for a Bluetooth microphone with a receiver you can plug into your phone/laptop. Then you can just use any captioning app.

E.g. Ronde/DJI microphones that YouTubers use.

Provide it to the professors at the beginning of each class (na snake sure college tells them to use them).

My school pays for my otter account and they provided me with a Samson PDX1 microphone. 

I’m not sure the “spread really thin” argument is valid. They can hire outside agencies to provide remote CART services. Try the auto captioning. If it isn’t accurate enough, then you have the right to CART.

\&gt; I am not given any captioning because the schools resources are spread really thin

That's what they all say. You're spending way too much on tuition to not get full access to your classes.  Take your school to court if you have to, you won't be the first one.

If you have an android, there's an app called ""live transcription"" that I use. Otter is also supposed to be good

I sit at the front of the class and have my phone on a stand in front of me with the transcription app on

NeoSmart pen and notebooks will record when the pen is on, the text you write will also become a digital document on a device. 

Vocational rehab is also an option to help pay for educational supplies (and tuition). But the wait can be terrible.

Once you get the transcript it helps a lot to run it through an AI to fix punctuation etc.  Most captioning software sucks at getting technical jargon right but AI does a pretty good job at figuring out what was meant.

iPhone has captions built in as an accessibility feature. So do Mac and windows 11 laptops. Try those first, in my experience they work quite well.

I would ask your professor maybe for notes or if they could caption their slides and presentations they show? Can you not get an interpreter or at least an FM system to borrow if you're more oral and wear HAs? Is there no CART to borrow?  If your school doesn't do note takers maybe a friend or classmate in your course would help? This is what im afraid of going to a hearing college im at a hearing HS and rely on an ASL interpreter. The schools im looking at are known for good disability student services tho im so sorry you're going thru this. Good luck and maybe meet with disability student services when you can or before next semester at least! ♡

I use an app called Live Transcribed. I’ve used it at lectures, not at school, though.

If you are in the US, it's not an option for them to not provide accessibility. The law REQUIRES it. You can request CART and/or interpreters as well as notetakers. First step would be the school's disability office. Next step would be to contact your state's vocational rehab office for assistance. Every state has one and they should be able to provide resources and guidance. Vocational rehab in my state also provides free college tuition for deaf residents but you have to ask to get it. If you still don't get anywhere, you can start the legal process by contacting the DoJ and filing a complaint. It's only takes a few minutes to file an ADA violation complaint. [File a Complaint | ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/file-a-complaint/)

There are lots of options for auto captioning. Windows 11 and macOS have live captioning built in. Google Chrome has live captioning built into the browser. There are phone apps such as Ava and Nagish. You can also get really nice Lavalier style microphones on Amazon from $40 to $70 to improve captioning.

I’ve never heard of a caption microphone, but I have heard of auto captioning glasses. A deaf creator I follow got some

You can open a blank PPT on your laptop and turn on live captions/subtitles. It works pretty well. 

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-with-real-time-automatic-captions-or-subtitles-in-powerpoint-68d20e49-aec3-456a-939d-34a79e8ddd5f 

There’s also the live captions option on your phone.

You need a little microphone from Amazon and the swift ware caption.ed

Smart noter  app I use 
It transcribes audio to text

Live transcribe. Works so so 
Hope this helps 
Good luck 👍🏼

Android especially Pixels are highly accessible.

I use auto live transcribe daily. One thing, devs told me I could connect a Bluetooth mic to it and it'll pick up the person's voice for the transcribe app. I never tried it but I'm sure any mic with bluetooth and a recent phone will work well.",2025-08-29 14:18:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n38pg0/personal_auto_captioning_microphone/
1n2zno2,deaf,Question for deaf people does anybody prefer English dub subtitles over the Japanese dub subtitles?,"

[댓글]
If the dub isn’t English I prefer my native language subs. If it is English I prefer English subs

So I was and am a huge anime nerd (Onepiece man, only one I have to read the manga and watch the anime). I lost my hearing 5 years ago. Even then, I’ve always preferred subbed, nothing wrong with those that prefer dubbed. I just like sub cause back when I was a kid they always cut/censored scenes on dub anime. 

After rewatching it in subbed as an adult, it just stuck and sounded natural. Now that I can’t hear it really doesn’t matter except for release date. If you have crunchyroll, the subbed anime comes out before dubbed because subbing it easier then actually voice acting it. The subtitles have always just looked naturally to me and I can read while a scene is going on through anything except while playing a video game.

 I hate it when a scene is going on and I have to do something and subtitles are passing by. Like dude! Give me a cutscene instead, don’t make me work while talking. I wanna know what’s happening.

Oh my bad I only read English tho. So I prefer English subbed with Japanese voices to any anime, because as stated it just releases faster.

I'm not sure how this applies to r/deaf but I'll put on my otaku hat. I like watching anime in Japanese with English subs . In my experience, the English dub will not always be a literal translation of the original. Oftentimes an anime will offer the original Japanese audio with subtitles that are a direct English translation and then an option for the English dub which may not be a direct translation of the original Japanese with subtitles for the dub. So two audio tracks and two English subtitle tracks that.

Sometimes, I like to watch the English dub with the English subtitles for the original Japanese to see how much they changed the script for the English dub. A great example of this would be Naruto.

most streaming services I've seen only offer one set of English subtitles as far as I'm aware (I know netflix subtitles are based on the english dub for example), the hearing members of my family prefer sub to dub but it wouldn't make a difference to me either way tbh

So far, I've stuck to anime with dubtitles precisely because the disconnect between what is said and the subtitles is infuriating. For those that don't have dubtitles on a particular platform, (Looking at you, FMAB on Netflix) I use an extension called Substital to load a separately downloaded copy of them.

Subs all the way.

Sub for sure. But many services only offer the one set of captions and it is hard to tell which version it is based on. In the end it is really translated no matter how you look at it. And basically two different sets of translations. If they took too much liberties with actual plot details or worse yet renamed character names I hate it but I’m okay when they reworded for flow. I can’t stand stilted. 

But then I live in Sweden so I’m used to “translation-subtitles” from start.  As we’re a subtitle country not dubbing due to small population size.

Depends on the show.

Japanese has this thing where their dialog is fairly ""proper"", even when it's supposed to be crass, vulgar, or simple. Personally, this hurts some shows, like Black Lagoon, where  most of the characters are supposed to be dirty, nasty, crude pirates and mercenaries..... because they still speak fairly ""proper"" when translated.

So yeah, depending on the show, the dub wins IMO. Highly situational though. Also, some dubs are just so high quality or so iconic that they win over subs.

Are there many shows that resub with the English translation? When I watch English dub, the subtitles are not always accurate since they just use the Japanese translation.

From my understanding, you mean English or Japanese sub, not dub. Nearly all animes on dub = no subtitles. If it's on sub(English) then it speaks Japanese. So the question is irrelevant to deaf people.",2025-08-29 06:10:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n2zno2/question_for_deaf_people_does_anybody_prefer/

I’d love to be a vendor, but I also know my limitations.

That said, I did request information so I can attend as a guest. Even though I won’t be fully participating, I’m still excited to go and be part of it. 

[댓글]
Have fun! Scope it out. See if you can bring an interpreter or something next year!

In my experience the deaf community is very accepting of people actually interested in learning to sign and engaging in community events. I could totally be wrong but I don't think you have an issue participating.

Is it a deaf or Signing event? You’re not alone in being not fluent in Sign. Plenty of deaf &amp;  hoh people don’t exclusively sign. You can ask the host about it and see if you could join as a vendor if you want. Bring visuals for easy ordering/pricing, practice finger spelling words you don’t know, etc. You’re a part of the community, don’t fall into the “not enough” myth.

Put yourself out there! My signing is rough but good enough to get by. I'm primarily oral so imposter syndrome is very real for me but I've never experienced any gatekeeping from the Deaf community and have been welcomed without hesitation.

I am HOH started learning BSL and had a craft table at their winter fete maybe 6 months later despite not being super confident in my sign.

Everyone was so welcoming, the stalls around me were a mix of Deaf and hearing so I learnt a load of new signs and there was no issue at all. One of the other people in my class also had a stall and had the same experience, so I'd say go for it!

Hard of hearing here, also a vendor who's previously worked at deaf markets (and hearing ones too)...

Go! I have so much fun talking to everybody and it doesn't matter the level of signing. I do my best to match the speed of the person I'm signing with... So if I get someone in my booth who is a high school ASL student, I'll sign, but I'll also voice too when they need assistance in learning a sign. 
Sometimes I'll be completely voice off because I can see someone really making an effort to learn ASL and assimilate as best as they can. 
Everyone is different, but I've found Deaf markets to be one of the most warm, welcoming places to attend, even if you are not fluent in sign language yet. 
Either way, deaf/hard of hearing individuals can create some pretty awesome stuff, so it's always fun to go look at what's being created.

I learned how to read lips and talk mostly because we had no deaf community in the rural area I am from but I also learned some ASL for basic communication with my mom and sister.

1n1n6fm,deaf,update: acknowledging language deprivation is ableist?,"Hi again! 

I ended up deleting my other post titled “acknowledging language deprivation is ableist?”. i deleted it because it was brought to my attention that it read as if i was trying to “make the other person look bad” when i posted a screenshot of our comment thread. the goal of the post was actually information seeking and looking to correct myself if i was wrong, and had nothing to do with that specific person. i wish i had blurred out their name to truly make that clear, but i didnt think about it. 

all of that said, the original post is all still up on r/asl if anyone wishes to see that. there were no intentions of twisting anything which is why i posted the original post and the sub it is in. 

to those who believed i was telling someone HoH they are not Deaf enough, i apologize if that is how it read. To be clear, the person did not respond to me questioning if they were Deaf and i took a nonanswer as meaning they were not. they did reveal they were hard of hearing, and then blocked me. i do not promote any sort of elitism in the Deaf community, and definitely would never tell someone they are not Deaf enough. Deafness is a spectrum and EVERYONE is welcome, i just wanted to come here where i knew people were Deaf rather than someone i did not know if they were hearing or Deaf. regardless, i apologize to anyone that read that as if HoH people are not Deaf enough or not members of the community, because that could not be farther from the truth! &lt;3 I am late Deaf and i know how it can feel to be “not deaf enough”, and thats never how i would want anyone else to feel.  i also want to be clear, i do not believe Deaf kiddos are inherently language deprived/develop language more slowly than hearing peers. i fully understand its actually the opposite when kids are given sign! the school i was hired at just made sure that i knew going into it that most of their students are wrongfully deprived of sign and that that issue will not continue at their school. i wanted to be prepared to accommodate whatever needs my student will have. im sure i will even learn a ton from them! 

all of that said, the purpose of the post was to learn more about language deprivation in the Deaf community and essentially be told i am wrong/be corrected so that i can be better for my students. to those who commented, THANK YOU!!! i learned so much more about deaf education and where to focus my research. im Deaf, but i was not a Deaf kiddo. i have my masters in the field of child development (i dont love giving out info) and experience in education, but most of what you learn is geared towards hearing kids. i am realizing so much i need to make sure i understand about merging the two. i will not be the one teaching the kiddos sign, so i havent learned the ins and outs of phonics outside of hearing curriculums. 

the general consensus is i should fingerspell my name regardless of experience with sign. i was primarily concerned with age as hearing kids i have worked with are barely learning to spell CVC words. but, many people discussed how fingerspelling is understood much differently than spoken or written spelling and it makes perfect sense. kiddos have that skill of seeing the shapes of fingerspelling (that as a person who grew up hearing, i would kill for!) rather than seeing each individual letter and putting the word together. 

i appreciate all of the information you all gave me so so much 🤗 🤟🏻 i just did not want anyone to go after that person/think my post was even about their comment, rather introspective and wishing to learn more from yall, good or bad :) ",2025-08-27 17:19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n1n6fm/update_acknowledging_language_deprivation_is/

He will be fitted with hearing aids in the next month or so. I’m keen to hear from others who have lived this and what we can do as parents to make sure we do the very best for our son and giving him the best access to opportunities. We’re new to this so any advice, insight, or comments would be so so welcome. Thanks!

Learn sign language and get him connected to the Deaf community! That’s really the best thing you can do. That way if his loss gets worse, or his aids break, or he takes them off, you can still communicate. Dual language is an amazing approach to communication, there’s truly no downsides. If your audiologist or ENT says you need to do spoken language only, ignore that and look at the thousands of deaf and hard of hearing people and research articles who say otherwise.",2025-08-26 20:00:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n0w6ou/moderate_hearing_loss_from_babyhood/
1n0sitf,deaf,Fears related to no longer being able to hide my hearing loss.,"Hi, everybody, I am 32 and I just got diagnosed with bad enough hearing loss to get hearing aides. I've been steadily losing my hearing my whole life and have done an amazing job of appearing ""hearing passing"". I'm worried about my no longer being able to hide it. I know I shouldn't have to hide it, but the internalized ablism is strong. I also am autisic and the fact that I'm also deaf now scares me so bad.  I've been self teaching asl since I was 4 or 5, it's not great but I can kind of have conversations. I'm the first in my family to have hearing loss at such a Young age. So nobody saw this coming. 

Anyone have any tips, tricks, or kind words on navigating a hearing world? Or advice on fighting the internalized abilism monster? 

Thanks again,
Calmrow

\&gt; . I'm worried about my no longer being able to hide it.

You need to stop worrying about hiding it. Maybe talk to a mental health professional or find some peer support near you.  This is the wrong place to get better at hiding your hearing loss.

Get hearing aids. Start off slowly getting used to them. They'll amplify the sounds you didn't realize you were missing. Don't worry about what people think about them. Honestly rarely do people notice them and a lot of people wear them now. Lots of people have hearing loss these days from headphones and also fever/illness they didn't realize started to ruin their hearing.   

Work with someone you trust to start hearing therapy - listening to their voice and try not to read their lips.  This will get you back into ""hearing"" and also help you figure out the volume you need.  

Start thinking about little tricks to help compensate for loud situations where all of us struggle in hearing.  Like if you're in a restaurant, pay attention to the menu to see if they'll ask which sides you want or salad, etc. This way you're prepared for their questions. I always try to read the register when buying something but a tip I learned when I lost my hearing was always carry larger bills so you can pay the right amount (getting change back) and not be embarrassed that you didn't hear how much your total was.  

There's cell phone apps out that can help with captions so you can hear/read using the phone.  If you have a landline phone, they make those too and you only need to have your audiologist sign a form for it and it should be low cost or free in some places.  

I was always a little self conscious of my hearing loss until a good friend pointed out how so many people have a slight (or more) loss and they just wing it through life and miss things too. So know you aren't the only one and you're taking a good step to get hearing aids.

Only people who ever notice my hearing aid(s) are other people that also have them. I meet a lot of random kids that like seeing a younger adult that also has hearing aids. I worked with a guy 3 months on roofs just me and him, he didn’t notice them once till I took it out to change the battery.

Can you do an ASL program? Maybe a little emersion into the community to meet some people that will show you it's possible to have confidence. Even a few months around people that are in a place similar might help you get used to being around people with your hearing aides on if that is the issue you are worried about. I think if you are open, confident, and proud people will treat you much better than you are expecting. If they see you are trying to avoid it, they will get awkward and unsure of themselves. 🤞🏾

Honestly, you would be surprised how often people just don't notice the hearing aids. I've got a set in quite a noticeable blue and people just don't tend to see them.

Respectfully, you’re not “now deaf,” you’ve been struggling with your hearing for a long time. This recognition means that you can finally get help and not struggle so much through conversations.

I was born deaf, so my experience is different, but I really enjoy decorating my devices. Have fun with it! Deafness or disability (if you identify with it) is not a personal or moral failing. It just is.

If you are able to get the hearing aids, go get em! They changed my life for eight years (before I got a cochlear implant). The stress of not hearing is incredibly hard to deal with.

”done an amazing job of appearing ""hearing passing""

I’m very sure sure you haven’t done that. Since you’re autistic, I think that you haven’t really fully understood people’s reactions to your hearing loss. To be honest, they might even have e a worse impression of your communication skills, when they don’t know you have a hearing loss. I’d recommend that you talk to your audiologist about how you feel, and let them help you think things through.",2025-08-26 17:41:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n0sitf/fears_related_to_no_longer_being_able_to_hide_my/
1n0phm8,deaf,Transcribe Live Users,"I’m torn on what App to get to help me hear whats being said to me .. I tried Otter and it was annoying for me to click through .. many screens I want just simple as humanely accurate as possible translation … This leads me to Live Transcribe but Im hesitant because I can’t figure out the amount of hours they allow you to use the App for each month … I read lots of reviews and a few said they get only 5 hours a month and I can’t find anything that says different plus many reviews say that in order to access the “best stuff” it cost you even more money over top of what it originally cost for the App … Again I can’t locate that info to even verify it. 

Can anyone who pays for Live Transcribe answer my questions in detail?   I have an iPhone

[댓글]
what type of device are you using? Iphone?   
For Android ""Live Transcribe"" is a free app from Google. the one in the Apple app store is something else.

Try Microsoft Translator. Free with no limit and handles lots of languages. Reasonably accurate and fast since it's built on their own cloud/Azure speech recognition. 

Two clicks to start conversation then unmute microphone. Scrolls automatically. Text is a little small.

Iphone - go to accessability- live captions.. It works well in my opinion.

I use Google Transcribe live&amp; and i don't pay anything, but I do have android..&amp; its not as accurate as i would like or hope..I have learned over time to read between the lines because its crazy sometimes 🤦🏻‍♀️

The best speech to text model for general use is called Whisper Large v3

Most apps will use smaller (less accurate) models or send your data to a cloud server for processing which can be slow and lead to needing to pay a subscription.

I made an app called ScribeAI for people like you who just want something
- simple
- accurate (it runs Whisper Large v3)
- private (it runs completely on your phone)
- without a subscription or limits (just pay once and you can use it an unlimited amount forever)

You can try it for free [here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/scribeai-transcribe-voice/id6751108783) if you like. 

The only caveat is that you need a relatively new iPhone (no older than an iPhone 14). Because it runs on your device it needs a relatively beefy iPhone chip to run.

Use the Live Transcribe Pro blue background with the dolphin logo app for iPhone.  Unlimited transcriptions, no limits + AI Summary of captions. affordable than others

1n0p160,deaf,Learning resources for Deaf students in India,"Hi, I'm a hearing SODA of 2 younger siblings. We all grew up in India where the resources for learning ISL were very few. There was also a huge focus on oralism and they missed out on some very precious early childhood learning, as a result they missed out on many years of school education. Unfortunately, it was only many years later when we enrolled both of them in Indian Sign Language (ISL) classes, that they started to thrive more. Unfortunately, my sister by that time developed other mental disorders by that time due to lack of access to language and things have been very rocky for her since then. She's been on medication and is now stable but I'm very sad about how much misinformation is there about deaf education in India and everyone from teachers to doctors to therapists guide kids towards learning speech and lip reading, disregarding the child's natural learning ability.

I didn't find a separate group for the Deaf Indians, so posting here. I want to spend few hours each week to develop resources for ISL for kids and parents, as well as deaf adults who have lost of several years of education. I'm curious what the community thinks are the most urgent needs for them at the moment?

[댓글]
The NewDelhi subreddit top mod knows about a group of Deaf people in India. He mentioned it to me once too, but I lost touch and forgot the name. Maybe you could try reaching out to him,  he might be able to point you in the right direction.

I'm a hearing individual from Gujarat and a web developer. I had no idea about deaf community and indian sign language until last year, when one of the canadian client had minimum criteria for accessibility in the project. After exploring a bit, I got to know about different disabilities and how different people uses tech. In my exploration, I found out about ISL and deaf community. Tbh I've never seen or interacted with even one deaf person in my life. I don't know if deaf community is that isolated in my city. I took an online ISL class last year from ISH Shiksha and the instructor was a deaf teacher. I couldn't learn signs properly as class was fast paced and it was conducted with no sound. It was new environment for an hearing person like me.

There is no awareness for hearing people about ISL and deaf community, this way if someone accidentally encounters a deaf person, they won't know how to interact with them or know some common things they should to handle interaction with them.

Talking about resources related to ISL, there are a lot of courses and videos online for learning ISL. I have seen content specifically for deaf (by the deaf) including YouTube videos, news, courses (english course for deaf), etc. Government has stepped in and released an extensive online dictionary for ISL. In general resources are still limited in compared to resources for hearing people. I'm hoping that it will grow over time.

If you need any help, I'm happy to help.

1n0fww1,deaf,Can full deafness be cured?,"(I am sorry if I say anything disrespectful) I have a friend who went deaf around 9-10yo due to side effects of some medicine. As a kid, he was able to hear with hearing aids but now he can't even hearing with them. He's almost fully deaf and he always talks about how his only dream is to be able to hear again but he kinda gave up on it that he can ever be cured because aids don't work for him now and he's almost 80% deaf. I want to know if there's any way for him to be able to hear again properly or atleast to some extent 🙏

[댓글]
As others said, there is no cure, but yes, for most people who want to be able to hear, a cochlear implant tends to be the next step when hearing aids don’t work as well. I believe most, if not all, modern HAs and CIs have Bluetooth connection that allows listening to music.

It sounds like he needs to immerse himself in Deaf Culture.

Treated, often yes, cured? No.

If there was a cure for Deafness, I'd say no thanks. I am happy to be Deaf. &lt;0/

\&gt;He's almost fully deaf and he always talks about how his only dream is to be able to hear again 

If he's been deaf since birth, he's never been able to hear, not like a typical hearing person anyway.  He doesn't need a treatment for his deafness he needs peer support and a psychologist that's an expert in helping people with this kind of thing.   


He's not alone in his situation, even if he feels that way.  Please ask if you or your friend have other questions.

Cochlear implants is the closest thing but it will never the same as natural hearing

Nope!!!!

No. There isn't a cure for deafness and no miracles will change that. We learn to accept who we are and embrace it.

If his dream is to be hearing, he has been failed by his carers. He needs community, he needs sign language, he needs access to Deaf culture. He will never be fully hearing, even if he gets a CI. But he will always have the Deaf community. He needs psychological support to embrace his position far more than he needs medicine. Managing his own feelings, fears and perspective will be much more helpful in the long run, even (and especially) if he does make medical progress.

Cochlear implant if he can. There’s no cure if that’s what you’re asking. Implants are a different way to hear, but curently the only technological option available for profound/total deafness.

Cochlear implants. I have Med-el Sonnet 3 and I can hear music quite well already. Been activated since 14th July

It depends on what is causing his deafness. It’s possible that a cochlear implant might help.

There is another condition called otosclerosis that can render you deaf and there is a possible surgery for that. But you typically aren’t born with it, it develops and can eventually lead to deafness.

There is currently a trial that has had positive results. It is only for people with that particular gene. I believe that gene is present in people that were born dead. 

Do a quick Google search. The news was reported this year.",2025-08-26 08:04:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n0fww1/can_full_deafness_be_cured/
1n099re,deaf,"Newly Deaf, Lipreader, and Struggling with Advocacy. How Do I Explain This Is Real?","Hi everyone,
I became deaf about four years ago, following a major medical emergency. I now wear bilateral hearing aids, but they don’t restore full hearing. I’m not an ASL user (yet), so I rely on lipreading. I live in the U.S., where our entire culture often faces a lack of compassion and understanding and I’m really feeling that.

When I tell people I’m deaf, I’m often met with dismissive comments like, “Oh yeah, me too,” or “Haha, same, I can’t hear anything either.” It’s treated like a joke or a quirk, not a serious, irreversible condition. I want to be able to explain that this is a physiological reality, my hearing loss is permanent and medically documented. It’s not selective hearing or a personality trait. It’s not something I can “try harder” to overcome.

I’ve been accused of not listening, yelled at for misunderstanding, and treated like I’m stupid when I ask for clarification. I’m trying to figure out how to advocate for myself in these moments, how to speak up without being brushed off or shamed.

I’d appreciate advice on:

• How to explain my deafness in a way that’s clear, firm, and not easily dismissed

• What terminology feels most accurate and empowering (deaf vs. hard 
of hearing vs. hearing impaired?)

• How to respond when people act like I’m ignoring them or not trying hard enough

• Tips for self-advocacy in public, work, or social settings, especially when lipreading is my main tool


Thanks for listening. I’m still learning how to navigate this, and I’d really appreciate any guidance or solidarity you can offer.


[댓글]
It's unfortunate,  but a lot of hearing people tend to nkt take us seriously when we speak. Because to them, if our voices sound ""normal"" then that means we can hear.

When I go to places where I know I'll need assistance and won't be able to understand anyone such as out to eat or airports I just voice off. I use gestures to show I am deaf because when I start speaking people assume I can hear them. 

When it comes to situations outside of those such as interacting with people socially or for work, you have to do a lot of advocating for yourself for people to finally get it. You don't owe them an explanation, but it may help get them off your back if you tell them you speak so well because you are only recently deaf so you learned beforehand. Emphasize that your voice doesn't mean you can hear. 

I'm sorry you're dealing with such troubles and I hope you find ways that work best for you to navigate these situations.  💚

Been there. My usual line is ""I know my mouth works, but my ears really don't. If I'm not making eye contact with you, there's a good chance I couldn't hear you.""

U don’t!!!!! We all going same as u are even i born deaf and i do speak and lipread and asl since i was 3 now i am 52. It people, not u they have no interest about us as deaf/hoh community and people they just dismissed us as usual

im very sorry to say i deeply relate to this and i dont have anything helpful to provide as i am in the same boat, but in a different language (french) and country. hearing people make this world so diffcult, its become very hard for me not to be suicidal about it.

The most challenging aspect of being hearing impaired is existing in two worlds, neither of which fully comprehends. All I can advise is to remain strong and always have faith in yourself.

I’m not deaf, but I’m disabled by MS to the point of being mostly housebound. Your mention of the dismissive comments you get resonates with me. When I talk to other people, I’m always perky and energetic, it’s always been my affect, so they can’t comprehend that I don’t have enough energy to go too far from my bed most days, or that the conversation we’re having will put me back in that bed. 

One way to ameliorate this is to just load your language with your reality. In my case, sick of nondisabled telling me “yeah I’m really tired too,” I started saying “My MS fatigue is really bad” instead of just “fatigue.” 

In your case it might look like saying “…because I’m deaf” when you mention you didn’t catch something. I’ve had to use that with “disabled” when a toxically positive saleswoman kept dodging my disability-related questions! 

I’m wishing you all the luck and strength you need on this.

What you're experiencing is very common, some of us get this bullshit from our own families. All that you describe is sadly a part of the deaf experience, especially for late-deafened people like you and me. 

  
\&gt; What terminology feels most accurate and empowering (deaf vs. hard of hearing vs. hearing impaired?

I lost my hearing due to natural causes over the course of a few years, \~5 years for my left side (100% loss) in my teen and the right ear was the same but slower and I could no longer enjoy music by the time I was 25. (in my mid 40s now)  I have found that with ""Hearing impaired"" people get hung up on the impaired and it doesn't go well. So I never use it and ask that others don't use it in general. For ""Hard of hearing""  from the culturally Deaf point of view, that's what you are but whether you use it for yourself is up to  you. I have found that the caveat to using hard of hearing is that people assume louder is better. They sometimes have unrealistic expectations of what you can still hear. Using the term ""deaf"" is perfectly acceptable deafness is a spectrum and total deafness in both ears is remarkably rare. I started to use ""deaf"" for myself when I started to meet Deaf people with better hearing than me. 

\&gt; How to respond when people act like I’m ignoring them or not trying hard enough

If you can, cut them out of your life. if they're coworkers, report them the HR. 

\&gt; Tips for self-advocacy in public, work, or social settings, especially when lipreading is my main tool

In a work or similar formal setting always be solution/accommodation forward.  In other settings be direct and blunt (yet polite).  Communication is always a 2-way thing and if they really want to communicate with you they can meet you half way. That may often mean just facing you when speaking to you. It's not hard.  You will find that people show their true colors much more quickly when you're different than them in this way.  It can be a little heartbreaking for a while, but you'll learn that some people just don't care enough, their loss usually. 

Ask if you have other questions!

I’m hard of hearing, so it’s a bit different, but I will get someone to speak for me, people are sometimes oblivious to the fact that I actually can’t hear sometimes and assume my hearing aids make up for my lack of hearing when they dont, and I barely wear them, they give me a headache and hearing sucks.

Side note, since you express wanting to learn ASL, LifePrint.com has over 1000 lessons for free :)

Like others said, it's a lot of advocacy.  

-Emphasize that you're deaf, point out your hearing aids (helpful if you can wear your hair so they're more visible to people), and if you are using your voice explain that you can speak well because you recently became deaf, but that speaking ability doesn't mean you can hear. 

-I don't know what kind of hearing aids you have, but for BTE hearing aids, you can get colored stickers to go on them, colored ear molds (even if you have the receiver-in-canal style, they can still make ear molds for them), etc that make your hearing aids more visible to others. Mine are currently gray because that was my only choice, but I need new ones and I'm going to insist on hearing aids that are colored (or black, if there's no way to get ones that are colored enough to stand out) and definitely colored ear molds.  I want them to be visible to emphasize that no, I'm not joking and yes, for reals, I am hard of hearing. 

-I definitely go voice off in certain situations because the moment I speak, it's assumed I can hear well (surprise, I cannot). This generally elicits a lot more understanding and help from others, and more willingness to work on facing you when they speak, get paper and pencil to write back and forth, use phones to text back and forth, etc. 

-Speaking of phones, mine (Android) can do live captioning, and has features that will alert to certain sounds, certain words and your name, etc. Check out the accessibility options under settings.  The live caption feature I have also has an option allowing you to type responses back to people. That might be a good solution for certain situations, and would allow you to go voice off without worrying about not knowing ASL. 

-Definitely work on learning ASL. It will be useful to you even as a beginner, and more useful as you progress because you can request interpreters for appointments, meetings, events, etc.  Even if you aren't totally fluent, you can explain that to the interpreter ahead of time when you introduce yourself. Explain you're recently deaf and are not totally fluent so you use ASL to supplement what you hear and lip-read, and vice versa. Generally interpreters will then sign more English word order and tend to mouth the words they're signing, which should help you so you're not constantly trying to lip-read one person with one eye and watch the terp with the other eye. 

And once you know ASL, that will give you more opportunities to go voice off, point to your ears and shake your head to indicate you cannot hear, and then sign something to the person who is trying to talk to you. They'll get the idea and usually go get paper and pencil or get out their phone or try some other method to communicate, if they don't sign.

-I fully admit this is passive aggressive and a bit deceitful, but if I can tell that people aren't going to work with me to repeat things, look at me so I can lipread, etc, and I'm not looking at them at that moment but know they're speaking to me, I will completely ignore them. I won't play the ""sorry I didn't hear what you said"" game with them, because it won't work. If I ignore them, though, they generally start to realize I am hard of hearing/Deaf, and are more willing to come get my attention before speaking to me, gesture, type or write back and forth, etc.  It makes it easier on me because it takes the pressure off me and it puts the pressure on them. They have to make the effort to communicate with me. 

So, for example, I might just ignore someone at a school event who is trying to get me to bring name tags somewhere, and when/if they finally get my attention, I would just stare at them blankly or with a confused look and not do anything, and then possibly offer my phone with the notes section open, or a little pad of paper and a pencil to them, forcing them to type/write to me if they want me to do something. 

It's not easy, and it won't ever get easy, but if you can figure out various strategies like the above and know what situations work best for each strategy, it will help a lot.

I can relate. The amount of times I want to just go voice off even though I speak perfectly clearly and have quite a bit of residual hearing. 

Because people don’t believe me when I tell them I can’t hear. 

But if just signed all the time, maybe people would get it…..  

I wish I could give you advice, OP. I can only commiserate.

Just want to let you know that I’ve deaf and lip reads all my life, retired now, and I used to work in healthcare. Able people will never under your struggle, but hang in there. Everything could be overcome except for music and hearing the rain.

I struggle with this myself. I wore bilateral hearing aids up until I retired at 65. I was reading lips and had to remind clients not to cover their mouths and face me. At 70, I have a new CI and this visual tool is going a long way to showing my deafness. It has taken my invisible hearing loss to a visible one. It's pretty sad, but now people believe me.

Depending on the type of medical trauma you experienced, cochlear implants are a great option for late-deafened folks and they are usually covered by insurance in the U.S. You have the auditory memory which would make rehab much easier. Answers to the questions you posed can be found at hearingloss(dot)org, the largest advocacy group in the U.S. for people with hearing loss.  Good luck!

Welcome to our world!!! What u been through same as we are going through on daily basis .  U will have alot challenges ahead u will see their true colors how they treat u differently .

1n03nqp,deaf,Is it cultural appropriation if a non deaf person teaches people sign language?,"My sister is learned dolmager for sign language (non deaf) 
I was on a work trip and there was a free sign language class so i joined. 
When I told her she was really shocked cause the teacher was a hearing Person. 

Her point was that this is cultural appropriation cause the teacher gave the chance away a deaf Person could represent their own language. 

What do you think about this? 

I think its great that there are people who teach the language cause its madly unrepresented and the goal is at the end that there are more people who can communicate with it.

One of my hearing teachers was a CODA with decades of experience in the Deaf community, and was also the chair of modern languages at the college.

Her partner in teaching spent many years performing with the National Theatre of the Deaf before becoming a teacher.

They are highly respected in the Deaf community despite being hearing, because of their deep immersion in the culture and language.

My other teachers were all Deaf. I would expect a hearing teacher to have qualifications similar to mine, otherwise I couldn't trust that they had the Deaf community's health and safety in mind.

I have a master's in teaching English for speakers of other languages, and I've been asked more than once to teach basic ASL, including once by a Deaf person. I've turned all opportunities down, even when there wasn't a Deaf teacher who could do it. Yes, more people should know the language, and I consider myself proficient with the culture, but I am not OF the culture, so I could never feel right doing it. I would question the motives of hearing people who want to teach sign.

That said: NOT every Deaf person is qualified to teach more than basic ASL, exactly the way that not every native English speaker is qualified to teach more than basic English. Teachers, Deaf or hearing, need a comprehensive knowledge not only of how to use ASL, but why it's used that way; they need to know the grammar and linguistics \*and\* be able to get that across to hearing students. I have had a Deaf ASL teacher who was amazing when it came to culture, and taught aspects of the language I've never even seen discussed elsewhere; however, her teaching methods were outdated, and so I wasn't able to retain much from the class. That's why this debate is probably never going to end, because there are all kinds of excellent arguments from all sides.

The general rule is that you should prioritize the teacher in this order...

1. Deaf
2. Deaf-involved CODA
3. non-Deaf (but fluent) deaf/hard-of-hearing
4. fluent 'terp
5. fluent hearing

That list presumses the individual has the qualifications to teach. A fluent hearing person with a teaching degree is better than a Deaf person *without* one.

The idea is that it's better to have a ""lower"" teacher on that list than *no* teacher at all. But when there's a choice, whether hiring an ASL teacher, your selection of where to learn (or who to learn from)? You should always go for the ""higher"" teachers on the list.

None of those ""lower"" people, though, would be guilty of ""cultural appropriation."" They are not teaching for their personal benefit but to share the language *and* culture. And, hopefully, being fluent *and* certified teachers, they are teaching everything correctly.

Those guilty of cultural appropriation are the ones using (bad) ASL on TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. to garner views, fame, and ad revenue. They neither understand Deaf society nor do they care; they're in it for *themselves* and their performances (and instruction) are horrible. I also highly doubt any of them have a degree in education, regardless of their fluency.

Copy/paste answer I made in r/asl a couple weeks ago. 

ASL pinnacle, Bill Vicars, the NAD, and HandSpeak all have mild variations of the same opinion.

Online, hearing people should never teach. Online there is access to Deaf ASL teachers and they should be prioritized.

In person, it depends. If the hearing person is qualified and fluent and there are no willing or qualified Deaf people in the market, then they can teach. But they still need to use Deaf resources/curriculums. They should invite Deaf guest speakers into class. They should prioritize Deaf culture, experiences, and voices. Most of all, they need to understand their hearing privilege and their responsibility to the Deaf community as a hearing ASL teacher.

If this teacher is a certified ASL teacher (through [ASL Teachers Association](https://aslta.org/about/))...

Then there is no issue. 

Problems arise when there is no certification. Regardless of what level of hearing ability the instructor has. 

Get certified, there'll be no problem. 

Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

I think it’s a touchy subject. I did a BSL Level 1 course and it was taught by a hearing person, she told me that once you get to level 2 and above it is generally taught by those that are deaf/HoH. 

I assume the beginners courses as it were, are sometimes taught by hearing people because the deaf sign language users tend to apply to teach the higher courses perhaps. 

Either way your sisters view is somewhat incorrect. What if no one else applied to teach that course? Should we have less courses for people to learn sign language?

Intro class it’s fine. I’d rather have people learning sign than not. Obviously this is assuming the person is well qualified.

No.

Is it wrong for someone who has studied say Portuguese and knows it well to teach Portuguese? If they are a better teacher than someone born in Portugal? Maybe the fact they learned it as a non native makes them better at teaching it?

It depends. It absolutely CAN be, but it isn't always. If the teacher has tact and defers to the Deaf community or is a CODA, for example then there likely won't be a problem. If the teacher sucks, then they suck. 

I started going Deaf in middle school and started learning ASL around that time. At first, I taught myself. Then I had teacher #1. Teacher #1 was a good hearing teacher who taught us how to operate amongst the Deaf community and made no claim to be an absolute authority. I loved her because she genuinely has authentic respect for the culture and actually knew the language well enough to teach it. 

Then I had teacher #2. Teacher #2 was hearing, but claimed to be an authority on the Deaf community. I could go into a lot of detail, I have a lot of stories about her. I actually made it my mission in high school to get her fired because I was so offended. She was fired after I graduated, rightfully so because (and this is important) she signed everything word for word, a bizarre bastard version of PSE/ASL. This was not okay. 

Then I had teacher #3, Deaf. We love teacher #3, she obviously was the best of the three for accurate information and a genuinely kind soul. 

I'm Deaf, but wouldn't teach as ASL is not my first language and im simply not qualified. Being Deaf or hearing is not the end all be all to whether or not someone can teach. Their understanding of the subject matter and ability to connect with students is.

Nope!!!!! U need to knowable asl and more ,, if u just teach asl as is , u will miss whole thing of meaning

There’s a shitload of them hearing teachers but ideally it should be taught by deaf.

I guess many fall back at “practical with hearing people” in the lazy kind of way. both at administrative level but also at classroom level.

I can excuse:
Hearing person teaching friends in private, not formally advertised in any way and also prefacing they’re not professionals. Like friend group level.

I can’t excuse:
YouTubers TikTok stuff and other 

Middle ground: teachers at formal level. This depends on: is the teacher fully, way beyond terp level of fluency? Awareness of deaf culture and struggles? Basically CODA or CODA level of immersion. 
But only *if* the spot had been advertised to deaf people and unable to fill. 

One major issue of ableism is requirement of education and many deaf are capable of signing and capable to formulate and reconstruct into lessons but lacks whatever formal education is required on paper.

I think it’s ok if they have deaf and signing family members. If they don’t I think it’s odd

There's different cultural understandings across Deaf Culture in the geographical locations.

I'll reference Aotearoa, New Zealand: Jon Tai-Rakena who speaks about hearing people teaching NZSL: [https://www.tiktok.com/@nzslwithjon/video/7496000421845028112?is\_from\_webapp=1&amp;sender\_device=pc&amp;web\_id=7504126001937860104](https://www.tiktok.com/@nzslwithjon/video/7496000421845028112?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7504126001937860104)

100% it is. Many people will say otherwise. But it is. I suppose in some situations where people are really wanting to learn and there is only a hearing teacher available, can we “stop” that? No. It’s still going to happen and has been happening for years and years and years.

At least she acknowledged it for what it was.",2025-08-25 21:43:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n03nqp/is_it_cultural_appropriation_if_a_non_deaf_person/
1n039ba,deaf,My father was defeated by deafness,"FYI this is just a tragic story with little to no positivity.

My dad has become progressively deaf due to a bone condition. By the time I was in middle school, he was already significantly hard of hearing.

For all these years, he has almost never let me know when he didn't hear me properly. When he *has* heard me, he makes no indication of this either. Not even a grunt or movement.

The reasons seem to be multiple but I'll start with the most twisted-up ones and work towards the most understandable:

1. He is convinced he can just bluff his way through conversations. He thinks his stoic thinking face can get him through any interaction, even when I directly ask him a question. This is just not true and I've told him such but he doesn't believe me because I keep trying to communicate with him even when I know he isn't completely hearing me, so he feels like he has successfully deceived me.

2. He finds appeal in the idea that talking is for busy-bodies anyways. He likes to live life free of gossip and he believes his maintaining stony silence most of the time in any conversation is a virtuous quality.

3. He thinks that the specifics of what is said in a conversation doesn't matter so much as being there in body for the other person. This is somewhat understandable except for the fact he really has no idea sometimes what the other person is saying, and he won't even admit it or say he cares that he didn't hear. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. But I keep desperately trying to communicate with him, so he's convinced I must be getting some emotional need satisfied by the activity or I wouldn't do it.

4. He lives in his own head. His constant dilution of all social interaction (alongside the aggravating effects of physical disability and chronic pain) has reinforced his tendency to turn into himself and seek peace living inside his own mind. At this point, even when he can hear me, he chooses not to.

I have no idea where to even post this.

He is embarrassed that he is deaf or hoh  he doesn’t want anyone know that he is

In my country he would get psychological support through the hearing loss health care. We don’t only have ENT:s and audiologists, but also counselors and psychologists who help people adapt to deafness.

It’s hard, because somewhere, he has to see for himself that there is different and more rewarding life to live. It does seem like he needs professional support. For easier cases, I think the problem is often lack of positive role models.

Honestly I get it. Sometimes you try and you get bad/harsh reactions. It’s embarrassing to see people’s exhasperation when you ask to repeat. Definitely need therapy, it’s what help me rn.

Some cultures will not accept disabilities. A friend is blind and her German parents could accept it. They told her she should work harder.

In denial and self conscious about being deaf or perhaps having to wear the hearing aids, hearing aids are also not the best either and can give them migraines

I can understand your father because I am also deaf. I come from China. When I was a child, I became deaf in one ear due to injections of ototoxic antibiotics during a cold and fever. Since I still had hearing in one ear, I could live a normal life, though my hearing wasn't as sharp as normal people. In elementary and middle school, I always sat in the front row of the classroom because of my hearing, and I got through those years peacefully just like everyone else. However, during my senior year of high school, the enormous academic pressure caused me to lose hearing in my other ear as well. Yes, I became completely deaf, and my college entrance exam was a disaster. After entering university, I got a cochlear implant, but the treatment effect wasn't very good. Gradually, my personality became withdrawn, I was unwilling to communicate with people, and my emotions fluctuated frequently. When I started working, the first few years were simply a mess. I began reading and meditating, and only then did things slowly improve. However, there's one thing - being unable to hear really makes communication very difficult.

He probably has repeatedly told you that he can't hear but you just jibber on. Then you ask him questions .
He knows you won't change so he just doesn't respond anymore.
It is the speaker's responsibility to assure they are being heard. Non response is a clear indication that isn't happening",2025-08-25 21:27:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1n039ba/my_father_was_defeated_by_deafness/

I know finding Deaf music creators is challenging. I’m not asking for music for free — I just want to support Deaf musicians. I would use the music to practice dancing, and I’ll be performing live on YouTube during the competition, probably with over 100,000 viewers.

Virgin is no better I am hard of hearing and non verbal and they have tried to tell me to call in multiple times for billing questions instead of resolving them by chat they also have zero clue about their iprelay client or VRS  although they apparently give 10$ off for persons with disabilities....

Please contact CHS again and ask to speak with the supervisor as this is incorrect. You can book for a 16 years old. There may be a misunderstanding depending on the appointment whether it’s at a family doctor which you can book on behalf but if it’s at the hospital, the hospital is responsible to book access.

Not necessarily to make friends (unless you become a regular commenter on a content creator’s account enough for other regulars or the creator to make friends with…) or keep updated on the local community’s events, places like Instagram, TikTik, and YouTube can be a fun place to follow Deaf content creators.

I’ve discovered something disconcerting &amp; unsettling recently—

When I’m listening to music streamed from my iphone (into my Phonak Naida L90UPs), I can obviously hear it.  However, after I take my HAs out, if I try to listen to the audio, I have to not only have my phone volume cranked, &amp; smash my phone against my right ear to hear it (&amp; even then, it’s very quiet), the music takes on a horrible, ring-modulator, heavily out-of-tune quality that’s SO bad it makes me want to utterly cry.

Is this a threshold shift thing???  😭

[댓글]
It could be just the crap quality of the speakers in your phone, plus the  more you turn it up the worse the distortion will be.

I cannot... possibly... imagine listening to music through a phone speaker.  All sounds through phone speakers sound like unintelligible squeaking.  Horrible.

I can only hear bass well and those speakers literally produce no bass.  

People always find it strange that I'm basically an audiophile - very finnicky about expensive high quality gear -- but I'm almost deaf.  I need every single decibel of signal quality.  

Best way to listen to music is a good sound system with big speakers that'll make you feel it in your chest.  Even hearing people agree on this.  Failing that, good headphones.  But you can damage the hearing you have if you crank it up too loud.

I usually just stream through my hearing aids these days.  My hearing aids have a music program.  It's essential.  All the speech processing stuff they do in general mode makes music rather unpleasant to listen to - though I find I can sometimes understand the lyrics that way (which I normally never can).",2025-08-23 14:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1my3jkw/music_with_vs_wout_has/

This would scare the shit out of my household and pretty much the entire apartment complex if it went off every time babe made a sound. And would quickly become something i pried the batteries from with my bare hands. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for vibration only baby monitors? Or vibration devices that i can link to a baby monitor? 

Thank you",2025-08-21 07:13:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mw4249/looking_for_a_baby_monitor_with_a_vibration/
1mw0c2q,deaf,Do deaf/hoh kpop fans like specific groups?,"i'm a 2-year baby asl student and kpop fan! Please do let me know if this is rude to ask. (i also wish there was an r/deafmusic because this is quite embarrassing to ask in a general place.)

i've heard of the stereotype that deaf/hoh mostly listen to bass boosted/""loud"" music and i don't like it, but i was wondering if that actually did apply.

i wanted to know if deaf kpop fans preferred more of the ""noise"" genre of kpop like stray kids or ateez, compared to the more r&amp;b ballad side of kpop like big ocean, the deaf kpop group, or bts, shinee, etc. Does the genre affect the level of vibrations you feel? (i mean this is obvious but do you like it more?)

i have only met old deaf people so far (no offense), so I haven't gotten the chance to connect with people my age pool! i'm going to deaf con this year and i really want to make friends...

I know it's all personal preference but i want to know if being deaf affects that preference overall.

1mvini8,deaf,"“Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to provide ASL interpreters for the 2025 America’s Air Show”","This is the third year in a row that I’ve received this email from the Miramar Airshow. I’ve submitted complaints to the DoJ. I’ve sent them the advocacy letter from the NAD. I’ve DM’d the Blue Angels. I’ve called them for more details that they won’t give. 

I just want to know what the commentators are saying while I’m sitting in the stands for the flight line performances. 

I’ll probably make a post in my local subreddit, but Deaf representation and accessibility posts in general don’t do well there. 

If you leave advice, I’ll look into it or let you know that I’ve tried it. 

Edit: this is for the Miramar Airshow in San Diego. 

[댓글]
Hearing interpreter here…UGH! It’s a public event. “We don’t have the capacity” is not a legally allowable response for not providing reasonable accommodations.

Given the fact that the announcers are pretty much talking non stop all day about nothing, and then saying useful things during the flight performances and it’s loud and hard to hear, there are legitimate challenges to staffing that.

HOWEVER, in my opinion the only reasonable limitation for them to present would be that they would like you to choose which day the request is for, and not do full day “air radio talk show” interpreting for all three days. In a perfect world, even that wouldn’t be a thing, but that’s a limitation I could live with.

They absolutely need to provide interpreters for accessibly. I’d be happy to provide suggestions and try to support this happening by apply extra pressure, if you’d like to DM me.

Have you notified DCS (Deaf Community Services-San Diego)? This needs to be on their radar. Also contact Disability Rights California.

Ah, but do they have the capacity for the ADA complaint? It's a pretty steep fine.

I’d push the safety aspect. Crap goes wrong at air shows all the time, not having communication is a big gap especially when you have documented requests for several years. They should have built it into their budget after the first request.

""We do not have the capacity"" is just another way of saying ""We don't know how"" because they're hearing and when do hearing/abled people EVER understand anything about accessibility?

TBH, if this was the third year in a row to deny you accessibility, you should have anticipated it this time and prepared instructions on how to implement that accessibility - the phone number of a local interpreter agency would be a good start. Also, don't take no for an answer. You KNOW this is your legal right and you KNOW they don't know what they're doing. Their ignorance does not override your rights. Educate them because they're never going to do it on their own.

Round up all the Deaf people in the area and picket. Try to encourage ASL and interpreting students; they would see discrimination up close.

Mike Ernest 
Staunton, VA

If they haven’t done it already, I’d like to know if they would even accept a free interpreter or make some excuse for why they couldn’t use one.

I’m sorry.  If you need a volunteer over zoom-   Hollar.

I know it's way easier said than done, but if you have the time and wanting, I think you got a good discrimination case on your hands.

If captions on your personal device would be an acceptable alternative, all it takes is them to place a call to an appropriate service to make it happen. They would come in over a small-footprint page on your phone's browser. Works fine over guest wi-fi or 5G cell.

It's not free (for them) but they could support all three days for less than the cost of one high-performance Blue Angels takeoff climb.

1muqo0g,deaf,Issues with YouTube app captions on Roku?,"Has anyone else run into issues with getting captions enabled on YouTube videos on their Roku device?  I am hearing but sometimes neurodivergence messes with my auditory processing so even bad auto captions would be better than nothing for me.  

I have enabled captions through the global Roku settings and am seeing them consistently on Fubo and my other streaming service, but YouTube is a problem.  I tried looking for settings within the YouTube Roku app itself but am not finding it.  Am I missing something or is this an actual design problem with the app that needs to be addressed?  Do any of you have workarounds or just end up watching YT on a different device??

I use youtube captions, but i don't have a roku tv. I have a roku plugged into an element tv. For me, there is a cc option near the channel profile when you go into the video.

The YouTube app (on all platforms) can be a bit finicky you can set your YouTube profile to default to having captions on for all videos. That should carry over to the Roku, might need to sign out and in again on the roku app.

I'm Timmy, a 30 year old with severe hearing loss, and planning to work and live in Australia. I wear a cochlear implant daily for verbal communication but am keen to learn Auslan (Australian Sign Language) to connect with Australian deaf community. 



This is my background:

Education: Bachelor's in Civil Engineering from a Chinese University (2014-2018)

Experience: 7 years as a BIM (Building Information Modeling) Engineer in construction, specializing in architectural design using tools like Autodesk Revit, ArchiCAD.

Hearing status: Uses cochlear implants; fluent in spoken Chinese, and basic spoken English; no Auslan yet but eager to learn.



I'd love your insights on:

How inclusive is Australia's job market for deaf people, especially in specialized fields like engineering/construction?

Are employers generally accommodating for Hearing disabilities? (e.g., meeting notes, phone calls with captions)

I've heard BIM skills are booming in Australia due to a 13,000+ talent shortage in construction. What's the realistic salary range for BIM engineers? (Search shows A$40k–100k on the application SEEK)

1mu7my2,deaf,Inappropriate as a white signer?,"Hi! I’m an ASL student in ASL 3, and every year my teachers have us sign multiple songs throughout the year. This year one of the songs I want to do is “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” from the movie Sinners, but I’m wondering if it would be appropriate for me to do so? I absolutely loved both the movie and the song, but I’m a white person and it’s from a movie about facing prejudice during the Jim Crow area and I just don’t know if it would be alright for me to interpret this song, or if I should just go ahead and choose a different one.

[댓글]
If the choice of material is mine, I pick something that’s aligned with my strengths. Especially given that Sinners has an entire Black ASL (BASL) interpreted track, I would definitely not do anything from that movie as a white person unless you have a good grasp of BASL.

Hi there. I’m Black, hard of hearing (in the big D though), and wrote my undergraduate thesis on Black ASL and other minoritized sign languages. 

Your instinct is correct. You should choose a different song. You can appreciate it and uplift appropriate voices (signers) for interpretations.

I hope that a Black Deaf person can answer your question here.

It's inappropriate for your teachers to be assigning songs as ASL learning.

IMO the teacher having you do ASL songs is inappropriate. Related doing a song that belongs to the Black community? You are asking the wrong crowd.

Be colorblind

The obsession Reddit has with race is so cringe 😂 do whatever YOU want. It’s racism for someone to think you shouldn’t do a song you like just because you’re white.

A couple of questions were actual facts, like what is closest related to asl being fsl and the percent of deaf people marrying other deaf people but these last questions made no sense. The answer for 15 was None of the above despite several deaf people more identifying with c or d. the answer to a different question was that it was considered rude in the deaf community to speak infront of deaf people with out signing, which deaf people i know never had a problem with. I guess im just asking if you guys think some of these things are considered rude or if you think these questions are strange ?

[댓글]
For #15, the key word is *culturally*. Culturally Deaf people do not identify as hearing impaired or ""little d deaf"".

”considered rude in the deaf community to speak infront of deaf people with out signing”

Of course it’s rude. There are many exceptions of course, but normally you’d exclude the Deaf person by doing that. The hearing in the room would understand, and the Deaf would not. It’s as if hearing people would start whispering to each other so that the others in the room couldn’t hear.

\&gt; which deaf people i know never had a problem with. 

You mean someone you know accepted that you're a hearing person, possibly accommodating your speaking bias, and didn't call you out on a faux pax?

Something’s off about your post. You “had a deaf friend growing up” and then later refer to “deaf people [you] know.” How many deaf people do you know? How often do you (meaningfully) interact with them? (Dinner table syndrome doesn’t count as meaningful interaction.) Are these *culturally* Deaf people, which would be pertinent to the question(s) you’re showing, or nonculturally deaf people? Because I can’t imagine you’re interacting with many deaf people, let alone culturally deaf people, and not understanding that it’s rude to have inaccessible conversations right in front of them. Tf?

As a Deaf Studies professor, I see nothing wrong here. Instead of trying to get answers on Reddit I suggest doing your own homework. I Read ""Introduction to American Deaf Culture"" by Tom Holcomb. It will have the answers to these questions. Or did your instructor already assign that to you?

Number 14 is full of ""actual facts"" because it's what the community does.... You are just not privy to it. Time to redo (or perhaps just do and not skim) the reading!

These are questions from Signing Naturally to start the dialogue… not weird at all!

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

So im assuming the question was, ""Is it rude to speak around people in the Deaf community?""

I guess generally deaf or hoh people won't care if you speak around them, i mean, what can they really do about it? Like they can't make everyone not speak around them even if they wanted to. But if you know, sign and they are Deaf and you could include them but dont just to speak? You're just leaving them out intentionally, and it would be rude.

As for the other one. The answer is clearly for cultural reasons? Deaf.

I identify as deaf because i can't hear. 

If i was cultured, I'd identify as Deaf. 

And if i was Deaf? I wouldn't want to be called anything else. Regardless of the fact that I'd still be deaf and Deaf.
Sometimes people, especially here or online will specify Deaf/hoh. Or d/Deaf. But that usually around other Deaf people or ones active in the community. Since they tend to understand that the amount of physical loss they have isnt that important.

1mtz42b,deaf,Hallmark Plus Caption Size – Anyone Else Having Trouble?,"Hi everyone,
Deaf viewer here, I subscribe to Hallmark Plus, and I’ve found the closed captioning font way too small to read comfortably. I tried adjusting it by going through my TV settings, the Hallmark Plus app settings, and even my device’s accessibility options—but no matter what I did, the captions stayed the same size.

I’m curious—has anyone else run into this problem? If yes, how did you work around it? Did you reach Hallmark support - if yes, what was your experience?

Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!

[댓글]
What kind of device do you watch on? If it's a smart TV app, what brand/type of TV? 


I've never tried the Hallmark app myself but as far as devices go a Roku box has had the best support for captions that I've seen.

Most of the Hallmark Plus stuff is on Peacock which has p good subtitles. I know because my mother loves the stuff and uses my subscription and I've watched a few of them esp around Christmas. Also I like the ones where Tom Selleck shoots people and solves crimes.

What country, device (roku, firetv etc) and settings you have on?

IME roku has the best SDH subtitles/captions.

I’ve streamed hallmark via a Chromebook to the tv and I found the captions small with no way to change it. My subscription was through my library via hoopla, in case that matters.

Two work arounds on my Lg tv 
Air play or cast from my laptop. Cc size is just fine on there an casts just fine. 

This one is less consistent but I’ve found that if I toggle between tv apps and go back to hallmark the font sizes were fixed. It has to do with the resolution of each app that gets loaded, they are not all the same and the larger resolution somehow gets preserved and carries over to font sizes on hallmark. Very strange behavior. You’ll have to experiment with the apps that make it work. Also try turning off your tv from hallmark and waiting and then load hallmark directly again. Again it’s all a hack but does work.

You can also cancel hallmark plus and resubscribe hallmark plus via Amazon prime subscriptions. That seems easier. Load it through Amazon prime.",2025-08-18 21:27:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mtz42b/hallmark_plus_caption_size_anyone_else_having/

1mtlvqt,deaf,"BSL Instructor said I shouldn't sign I'm ""going for a walk"" because I'm in a wheelchair. Am I misunderstanding, or is she rude?","Hello everyone, this may be classified as a question about BSL, so feel free to remove it, but as it's not ""how do you sign x?"" I thought I'd risk it.

I'm Hearing and I'm learning BSL. I started going to a Level 1 class which is about 10 minutes walk away from my house.

We were talking about transport in the latest class. The instructor taught us the sign for ""walking"" ""arriving by car"" ""arriving by bus"" the usual suspects. She then went around the room, asking us how we arrived at the class. So I signed that I walked to the venue. Then she corrected me. ""No, you didn't walk. You arrived by wheelchair"".

This took me aback, so I tried to play it off as a joke and replied, ""either or!"" She responded, ""no, not either or. You didn't walk to the venue,the correct word would be, you travelled by wheelchair"". At this point I was starting to feel flustered, but I tried to suggest that context was important. The usual vocabulary I use is ""I'm going for a walk"". I don't say, ""I'm going for a wheelchair"". I tried to explain this with my limited BSL. Again, she insisted it wasn't correct. At this point I caved in and used the words she wanted me to use, because I was aware that the rest of the class were staring at us and I was embarrassed. 

After I got home, I felt frustrated by the interaction, so I emailed the woman who co-ordinated the course for advice. I just wanted to rule out the possibility that it was a language barrier. She said that BSL is often a very literal language and it can come across as blunt to English speakers at times, but it is usually not intended to be rude (for context, the course co-ordinator is Hearing, and the instructor is Deaf). I'm trying to accept this and be sensitive to the language differences between English and BSL, but some questions are still nagging me. If the instructor was correct, why was ""arrive by wheelchair"" not on the information sheet she handed out with the other modes of transportation? And are there really no situations where you would say a wheelchair user was ""going for a walk""? What about a group walk? Would the accurate phrasing in BSL be, ""we're all going for a group walk, except for you, because you're traveling by wheelchair?"" And what about other common phrases? Am I allowed to say I'm going to take a seat? Or that I'm standing up for my beliefs? 

I admit I am a little sensitive about this because I've been singled out and bullied because of my physical disability in the past, so please let me know if I am being overly sensitive here. Also if you guys come back and say she was correct and this is just how BSL works, I'm willing to accept that and use the correct BSL term. I'm here to learn BSL, after all, and I'm not going to let my personal sensibilities get in the way. This is definitely not ""English is superior to BSL because BSL made me feel bad!"" 

Alternatively, if this is Ableism on behalf of the instructor, any advice for how to approach this situation would be nice! I'm planning to talk this through with her on Thursday when we next meet and I hope we can reach a place of understanding, but if not, I might have to remove myself from the class. I'm not willing to stand for Ableism (or anything else har dee har). 

[댓글]
This breaks the letter of the rule but I'm going to go ahead and (admittedly arbitrarily) give this one a pass. It's my opinion this one doesn't fit the spirit of the no sign language question rule.

I’m going for a wheelchair 😂 

I think your teacher was being too literal and rude, not blunt. Deaf folk can be ableist too. Just like hearing something or talking can be literal or metaphorical—surely, they must understand the difference… sorry you were treated like that, doesn’t sound fun!

Hard of hearing BSL signer who learnt in my teens here. Currently on my final Level 6 exam :)

BSL has a few different variations of WALK - [British Sign Language BSL Video Dictionary - walk](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/walk) \- but pretty much all of them do clearly reference using legs to ambulate towards a place. They don't mention precise method, so if the verb is not further specified it could be (say) walk-at-pace-with-legs or (say) walk-slowly-with-a-cane/walker/assistance. This is where adverbials come in.

In (fluent) BSL it is very very common to adjust verbs with adverbial NMFs - this adjusts how the verb is signed to describe how the action occurred. You can speed it up, slow it down, carry it on for longer than normal, twist it, turn it, do it unsteadily etc etc etc. You can also add another classifier construction after the verb in order to indicate how something was done, e.g.

&gt;ME WALK classifiers:(walking with a walker frame)

I have used BSL with some wheelchair users, but not who themselves are fluent or first language in BSL - so I don't know for certain. But in my experience we just used verbs like GO ([BSL SignBank](https://bslsignbank.ucl.ac.uk/dictionary/words/travel-1.html)) (which BSL teachers seem to loath because learners over-rely on it, but I find used very often).

Its worth noting that English is a very metaphorical language - whereas BSL is a very visual language. Even ASL (the language which most commenters here know) is visual but employs more opaque signs and more metaphors than BSL does in my experience (unless the signer is actively trying to avoid it). English is the way it is more because of etymology than logic - and uses a lot of metaphor - that BSL signers at least try to avoid. For instance you don't HAVE or possess (e.g. ""MY"") family in BSL because you cannot own people, instead you say ""FAMILY ME BIG. FATHER ME NAME m-a-r-k, MOTHER ME NAME..."" etc.

If a person in a wheelchair signed that they walked somewhere it would give me pause for thought. I would probably presume that they are an ambulatory wheelchair user - and thus do not use the wheelchair full time.

&gt;the correct word would be, you travelled by wheelchair  
\[...\]  
I don't say, ""I'm going for a wheelchair"".

I'm not 100% certain what you mean by ""travelled by wheelchair"" without seeing the way it was signed (rather than hearing it second hand in a different language) so I can't comment on that directly. I presume perhaps you mean TRAVEL ([British Sign Language BSL Video Dictionary - travel](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/travel)) (number 4) - which probably would be the go-to - especially as it can look quite close to a modification of SIT ([BSL SignBank](https://bslsignbank.ucl.ac.uk/dictionary/words/sit-3.html)) - and looks quite similar to WALK ([British Sign Language BSL Video Dictionary - walk](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/walk)) anyway.

In English ""I wheelchaired to the shop"" seems like making a point of it. With ""I"" perhaps they are doing so for a good reason (perhaps reclaiming it?) but if you said ""he wheelchaired himself to the shop"" - that seems almost rude. In English pointing stuff out can be rude - but in BSL and British Deaf culture it simply isn't if it is visual and you don't belabour the point (of course you can make it cruel, but the rules of ""rudeness"" are different).

WHEELCHAIR ([British Sign Language BSL Video Dictionary - wheelchair](https://www.signbsl.com/sign/wheelchair)) would, like English, not usually be used as a verb - but if it was I also wouldn't bat an eye. I'd more expect that someone would sign WHEELCHAIR and then use a classifier like grabbing the wheels and wheeling it manually (or perhaps using a stick if they use a mechanised wheelchair).

&gt;She said that BSL is often a very literal language and it can come across as blunt to English speakers at times, but it is usually not intended to be rude 

This is true.

You can literally describe people as classifier:(large-and-round) and mouth:(puff-cheeks) - but so long as you don't mouth ""fat"" - it's not rude. So;

&gt;GO(over in a direction) SEE PEOPLE 3, 1/3 classifier:(rail thin), 2/3 SHIRT BLUE , 3/3 classifier:(large and round)-mouth:(puff-cheeks) - 3/3 ASK.  
""Go over there - there will be three people. There'll be one rail thin one, one in a blue shirt, and one large-and-round one - ask the third.""

That is simply a physical description - but would be considered rude in English.

TL;DR - I don't know for sure but I understand why your teacher is saying what she is saying. She is not trying to be rude - she is trying to tell you that BSL is a visual language and you should avoid abstractions and metaphors that don't apply where possible.

I hope this is helpful :)

I think the instructor was a bit too strict on ""terminology"" which can happen, technically you did travel by wheelchair. Some people would correct that I didn't HEAR... I saw it. Even though I use ""I heard that blah blah"" all the time 🤷‍♀️ (also they say I'm hard of hearing cause I use hearing aids 😂 and I use ""hear"" terminology it's lil insane but it's bound to happen with few people. It's a weird thing in deaf community)

I understand that you're feeling this way, I've been there before. It's frustrating, and you're definitely right. You can use ""i walked"" if you tend to use it. 

You can talk with instructor and stand up for yourself because they may not realize it at all! Sometimes deaf people dont have correct social situational contexts including myself.

I (wheelchair user who also signs) think this is a little too strict. 

I do remember though in my sign classes having to explain ""disability positive"" as an attitude, as disability in general (excluding d/Deafness in this case) was viewed as inherently bad and something that is problematic. I didn't go so far as to fully break down into the Social Model, but I remember being taken aback because I was explaining what seemed like basic things such as ""I feel okay with the fact I have to use a wheelchair and don't want or need sympathy"". 

There could also be an argument made for a literal interpretation as it more clearly communicates the mode of travel, but I have never caused any confusion to anyone signing that I ""walked"" somewhere.

It's hard to tell from here whether this is ableism or just a stubbornness on the part of the teacher.  I wouldn't rule out ""both""... Some people just don't like being 'talked back to' or 'put on the spot' -- I'm a teacher and I wouldn't blink if someone asked me that either. 

For the record in ASL, I would have used/expected ""walk"" too, because the basic meaning is you traveled here without using any other form of transportation (e.g. bus, car, TARDIS).  I'm Deaf and I use phrases like ""I hear..."" ""That sounds good...""  

I'm not sure that talking to the instructor will go well.  You might ask when/how would be a good time to ask about alternate approaches for a given sentence. Some teachers prefer a brief meeting after class to ask this type of question when other students aren't there (even though the other students would benefit from the answer too!)

As a wheelchair user who signs myself, I think my main frustration would be the lack of inclusion in the lesson. There was no option you could have picked that would have been correct. You did not arrive by bus, car, train, etc. Wheelchair users frequently use walk as a substitute for roll because that’s just how English works. Yes, sign is not English and it shouldn’t expect to work the same, but you are the student here and only had the vocabulary she had provided you to choose from as options. The option you chose was the only correct one from what they provided. If you’d chosen bus/train/etc. you’d also be wrong. The teacher knew they had a wheelchair user in their class. More than that, they made a spectacle of you in front of the entire class about their lack of foresight in vocabulary inclusion. It’s a bit ableist even if unintended by the teacher.

I think the instructor is wrong, if you signed ‘I’m going for a walk’ or ‘I walked here’ to a BSL user, no one is going to be confused about what you meant. Your instructor may be following the actual rule (I don’t know) but I’d say in conversation you’d be fine to say walk. 

Given that your aim is to pass your level 1 could you get in touch with the company who will be assessing (when I did mine it was signature but I’m not sure if there’s different ones) and ask them which you’d need to use in order to achieve a pass. 

Passing BSL and holding a conversation with BSL users don’t always follow the same rules I found when I passed mine

I use Auslan not BSL (more similar than ASL) but this was interesting to me as I am currently using a scooter to get around due to ankle surgery and people have done the sign for scootering instead of walking when talking about me lately! I hadn't really thought about it until your post.

Non native ASL user here. If you (as a wheelchair user) signed that you walked here, I’d probably make a quick joke about walk versus roll, then move on. I probably wouldn’t make that joke a second time, ever. 

Yes, sign languages tend to be more literal. We don’t sign RUN ERRANDS, for example. I would hope that ASL and BSL users have enough of a grasp of English that using the sign WALK, in context, could also include using a manual wheelchair.

My experience is with ASL and not BSL, so the signs will be different, but I think the experience of people with disabilities in our respective countries is similar enough that it doesn't matter.  

My former ASL instructor (and now friend) is a retired social worker. She didn't learn sign language until she was 15, and she struggled in hearing school until that point. Her experiences very clearly inform her worldview- she's whip smart, but she was othered and treated as if she was stupid or less-than for her early life simply because she couldn't hear the people around her. When she goes off on her little rants about the infantilization of disabled people, I see the pain there and the resolve to make sure nobody else feels the way she felt.  

Anyway   
So sorry sorry for the walls of text  

I caretake my father, who uses a wheelchair. Every evening, we go for a walk with his dog. When I sign about the three of us as a group, I sign ""walk"".  
When I sign about my father, I sign ""wheel"".   
When I sign about the dog walking, I use signs that show the way she moves- different from my own dog because they walk differently, but clearly a dog walking and not a person.  
I sign my own walk differently than I sign about my partner walking because we have different strides, postures, etc.  
The key thing here, though, is that these differences in signs are, for me, stylistic aspects of storytelling. I am describing a scene with my hands rather than conveying information.   

For conveying information, for the most basic communication, I'm not going to use those flourishes.  

""Me, my dad, dog, together walk every evening,"" is very different from telling a story in which me walking, my dad zooming, the dog trotting all help to set the scene. 

Your instructor was either being very literal or was trying to convey the visual storytelling aspect (almost like alt text on an image for blind/vision-impaired users- you wouldnt leave out the wheelchair), or she was being a pedantic shit. She did it poorly, stubbornly, instead of taking the two minutes to explain that you're using your hands to show what somebody might see.

So in your case, I think back to my own teacher. She would likely advise you to use ""wheel"" rather than ""walk"". I will ask her at deaf meet up this weekend, but I imagine she will say there's no shame in using  wheelchair and so it shouldn't be weird to use a different sign. She'll say something like, ""it's true- they wheel. Why should they pretend they dont by using different sign?"" before some spiel about changing how we talk to make other people more comfortable with disability is harmful, that it reaffirms for us that disability should be hidden or treated differently. She will become utterly self-righteous, and I will love her for it. (I think you would, too.) 

The thing is, though, that she would explain this to you in a way that would make you feel seen and understood and proud. What's most wrong in your case is that your teacher didn't do that. They treated you differently, didn't listen to your perspective, didn't describe their own. They effectively said, ""you're different, and you need to sign differently than everybody else because of it."" They singled you out and pressured you. 

I'm really proud of you for recognizing this, and I'm sad for your teacher, who likely felt different at many times in her life, but who isn't healthy enough to avoid making others feel the same.  

Tl;dr:   
In the end, I think the difference between ""wheel"" and ""walk"" ultimately dont matter at your level of BSL. You are learning to convey information at this stage, and ""walk"" does that just fine. Further in your studies, ""wheel"" might be better in certain situations to add artistic storytelling flair. Either way, it's *your* movement, and what *you* feel comfortable with is what matters here.  

Your teacher was wrong in how she handled this.

Deaf and fluent BSL signer here.  This is one of my trigger points so apologies u/Training_Tiger_9717  there is a lot of text here.

There's a huge amount of ableism in the Deaf community.  Some is conscious, and a lot is unconscious. We've not really had a significant national conversation about disability inclusion in BSL. There are various reasons (not excuses).

* up to the last few years the priority has been on sheer survival of a threatened language. BSL signers have been heavily discriminated against, and excluded from accessing education, and excluded from participating in the general discourse about language and words and disability inclusion.
* there has been friction between disability groups and deaf groups.  Disability campaigners have called for closing all deaf schools, which to deaf people are the heart of our community, and many deaf schools have deaf staff, deaf teachers, deaf Heads etc. We see this as hearing people calling for deaf people to be sacked and thrown out of education. This is extremely sensitive for deaf people because sign languages around the world were driven underground after the Milan conference of 1880 that called for signing to be abolished in schools.
* deaf groups are not innocent either. Deaf people have a habit of regarding themselves as not disabled, just people who use a different language. Deaf schools are also regarded as 'not disabled schools' - just schools for people who sign.  In the past there was a slogan: 'We are deaf not disabled' and disabled people have told me they found this very offensive.  They felt it implied deaf people were better than them.  Thankfully this slogan seems to have been dropped and I rarely see people saying it any more.

(reddit won't let me do a long comment. See below for part 2)

Your instructor is correct in saying you used your wheelchair for transportation.

You are also right that she should have included wheelchair as a mode of transportation. You would not have been able to know that was an option because she gave you a very limited list, which excluded it as an option.

If she's a competent instructor, she will update her materials to reflect that she understands that her list is very limited as it currently is.

I’m a wheelchair user in the US and I say I’m walking!

Speaking from personal experience,  she's ignorant. Rude possibly,  depending on her connection with the disAbility community,  but most definitely,  she's ignorant.

I think the instructor was wrong.

OP I left a comment in reply to someone else saying this but I wanna point out that regardless of whether or not your teacher “was wrong” to correct you in terms of the grammar/vocab of BSL, they were wrong to correct you in the way that they did, in front over everyone, without giving space for a more nuanced conversation explaining mode of travel vocab vs general getting around vocab (if I am understanding the point of the lesson correctly as being about mode of travel only). 

Either way, something happened that hit you wrong, you tried to express that (and probably did a pretty good job of that since you were on the spot), and you feel that the teacher did not respond appropriately. I think they was that they handled this, minimally, is potentially ableist (in how they responded to you), if not also the exact language they used. I am not a BSL signer (I sign ASL and LSM), and maybe BSL is “more literal” than either of these languages, but I don’t think that’s a reason to dismiss your experience even if it is the case. 

I’d recommend either trying to find a Deaf BSL signer who uses a wheelchair (Deaf+) who can advise you and/or your teacher on an appropriate way to describe your mode of travel, who may also then be aware of how to explain it to you if your teachers signs are correct, or educate your teacher if they were not. Either way, this person would likely be more knowledgeable in this area than your teacher, since it sounds like your teacher is able bodied. 

Tldr you have a right to feel how you do — and your teacher needs to explain better, or do better. Highly recommend you talk either way teacher about this, and you or teacher find a Deaf wheelchair user to consult with here

The deaf here say I am lucky because I have a deaf and disabled license plate, it's very uncommon to have both in the US, I don't know what percentage is but it's probably less than the number of redheads born here, IDRK. They told me that I am lucky because I get to park up front, the only lucky thing I feel being alive. Lucky isn't being a paraplegic with a brain injury. That statement made me cringe.

Think your BSL is rude, I say going for a roll but that sound like I'm going outside to smoke a roll. Maybe going for a walk is fine, just say I have a dog then im going for a walk. Do people say I'm going for a skate if they use a board or skates?

Some of those expressions would be more literally phrased. 


By that I mean, one doesn't actually take a seat in the sense that, we don't bring it away with us. In English, it's generally another way of saying sit down. 


A lot of signs are very visual. With a number of aspects to them. So it's not just that WALK is a sign, but they might represent their gait, speed, movements etc as modifiers to the base sign. Similarly to how DRIVE, you literally just show how you drive. Was it a lot of turns? Was there lots of traffic? Was it stressful or fast or relaxing? Rather than having a number of signs, many will just modify a sign. 


It's important to remember that BSL isn't English with signs. Lots of idioms, metaphors, connotations, just don't exist. Instead there's going to be BSL specific idioms and phrases that would have an equivalent meaning. 


Similar to how English says my sweetheart, Castilian Spanish says my half-orange (mi media naranja) and Irish says my shining love (mo ghrá geal). You can't word for word say those things translated and be understood. 


There will be some discrepancies when it comes to some disabilities. In terms of work sheets etc, things being omitted or overlooked. I've asked my lecturer about it, she's a native BSL signer. It's pretty common apparently for signs to be adapted to the users, for instance missing digits, limited head movement, arthritis, dyspraxia etc. And apparently it's pretty common for BSL natives to need to tune into anothers accent or dialect.


The dialect I'm learning will cover me for Essex, outer London, Hertfordshire, Surrey and Suffolk. Sussex and East Kent have their own dialects, Bristol too. 


As generations of DdHH kids went to school in BSL, each generation has replaced a finger spelling of a term, and created their own signs. But different deaf schools created different variants. 


I go to some online conversational groups with a friend of mine who's been helping me learn alongside college. He's pretty rusty, partly due to his dyslexia, and from numbers, to colours, to transport, to animals, to foods, city names, there's different variants all over England, let alone the wider UK. 


For context, I'm autistic and an auditory processing disorder, but it does seem that BSL is more matter of fact. 


So (this isn't me saying what the sign is, it's more an example of how I perceive the way the language works)
Earlier i said ""he's pretty rusty"". I don't think BSL would have ""pretty"" to mean ""very"", and I don't think they'd necessarily use ""oxidised metal"" to represent lack of frequent usage. 
Instead it might be ""point HE, BSL CONFIDENCE LOW, WHY? REASON, DYSLEXIA, ALSO, FAMILY NOT LEARN BSL""


I'm not a particularly visually detail oriented person yet BSL goes a lot for the visuals and tends to be kinda to the point. I noticed that my classmates kinda felt they were being a bit rude at times due to their perception of the sentence structure as blunt or abrupt. I, being autistic, found it very refreshing, because I get to say exactly what i mean, just like I always do, and unlike before, everyone else is also doing the same. 


Now that doesn't mean it's definitely not ableism. I wasn't there. I can't speak for that situation, in terms of intent vs reception. But it's hardly unusual to have disabled people being ableist, I mean I read autistic people being ableist to autistic people. 


There's kinda a...... gap. We're all totally separate communities for the most part. Some of the more common disabilities, particularly those that have been written about for centuries, don't even realise that half the other disabilities or their communities even exist. 


This then puts people like my friends in awkward positions. Those who were autistic and then became deaf and later Deaf, vs those who were born Deaf and then later as adult got autism diagnosis. They tend to struggle in that neither community has lots of experience of the other, partly due to the nature of the disabilities.


Personally, I would support signs for different disabilities adaptations being taught regardless of whether a member of thar specific disabled community is present. Even a whole lesson on disability terminology. Having the nuances of signs being explained. English and BSL don't have a one to one relationship. Lots of medical and science and technical terms there's just no sign for. Not even a sign for every country. 


Example was discussion of just HOW do they work around that? I gave example of cholecystectomy. And I think in the end it was something like ""bile sac, doctor need cut out"" as wasn't a sign for gall bladder apparently. 


I did notice in chats with my lecturer after class, that some concepts, or some distinctions, just don't exist in BSL, partly as they've just never needed them. The way things are explained is very different so some things just don't exist. Similarly, lots of signs have no English translation directly. Sometimes one sign with the non manual features, can be a whole sentence in English. 


The way we think about the world is heavily dependent on our native language. How many colours there are all depends on the language you had as a kid. The way you understand situations can really change if a different language uses a different verb for instance. To the point that guilty verdicts in hypothetical court cases in studies, differ depending on which language you ask the question in, even for fully bilingual folks. 


It's possible that with some of the literal and visual aspects of BSL, that that's going to influence the way they experience life. I note parallels with much younger me being confused with why nobody used realistic numbers. Mum why do you say you'll be back in a second? It's usually about 15 minutes. My experience of the universe and how my brain works, means back then my logic would have been, ""well no she's smart enough to know that Be Back Soon means she'll be back soon. If she meant that, she'd have said it. So why does she think a second is sufficient time?""


I've noticed that many outsiders can be very reductive. In the sense that they might imagine a blind or deaf person as exactly like their entire life experience, and then just closing their eyes or being in a very quiet room. They don't really think about, someone growing up with a fundamentally different world to live in.

Okay so I’m a wheelchair user and I’m hard of hearing, learning BSL. I would personally sign ‘walk’ because the people that I know that sign would understand what I mean by that. I don’t have any qualifications in BSL so some people might be able to give a better answer than me, this is just what I would, and have, sign.

Not BSL but if this were ASL (I have met enough BSL signers to think this could potentially still apply)....

The most correct way would be basically you going out for a roll. ASL is a visual language and concepts are often rooted in concrete visuals. She is letting you know how to make your signing look more Deaf.

If you're with a group with folks who are doing the leg method of ambulation, then two legs walking is fine, you don't need to be isolated out. Someone in your group will match the visual of the sign and that's good enough.

It's not about telling you that you can't do stuff, it's just about visually conceptual  accuracy of how you do it. Moving around in a wheelchair can be hard whether it's the stamina and strength needed for a manual or the steering dexterity for a big old honker of an electric in some areas that were never designed for it. Be proud to show how you get through the world. Concrete actions are typically signed to visually match exactly how they are done.

I would also maybe examine why you are sensitive here because learning any sign language what people can see about you if often considered fair game to say and describe, and there's usually no hard feeling there. It's just the nature of Deaf where vision is most Deaf folks main sense.

I'm always happy to see my blind friends and they're happy to ""see"" me. 

If you are in a different situation compared to most other BSL students, it's important to have the vocabulary to convey that, assuming it's not so esoteric nobody would know what you're saying.  That doesn't mean you have to use the most verbose form every time.

Hot Take: NOT rude. Being Deaf, many of us don't like when people use ""hear"" for us when we clearly can't. Some of us also do this for blind, as we won't use ""see."" It's partly a cultural pattern bc it's considered erasure of our language and culture. She could be trying to give you that opportunity, albeit Deaf-bluntly, that you're entitled to not erase your own disability when signing. Because when you think about it, the world is centred around non-disabled people, and adhering to their language that erases us and our truths helps no one. I have multiple disabilities and when I'm not able to walk, I sign ""wheel."" It's part of me and I'm proud of that. Just bc everyone else signs ""walk"" doesn't mean I have to give in to it colloquially. I would never sign ""Yeah, mate,  I hear you."" I might sign I understand or know, or even same. In fact it's rude. So signing ""walk"" when I can't is equally ""ick."" So in my opinion, bc you asked publicly, learn how to sign from your inductor of fond a different one. But I'll bet others may feel the same way.

I was in some forum years ago (YouTube or Facebook) and it was about deafness and I said I was talking with my brother over the internet, after introducing myself as hoh, when another person said: “This is a troll. He wouldn’t be talking if he was deaf”, I explained that “by talking, I meant typing”, then the person said “No you didn’t”. I suspect that person was a troll, but could possibly just be ignorant.

Hello there! Deaf here and have worked with individuals with other disabilities since forever. 

I don’t think your teacher intended to be rude. Maybe, you found it a bit bizarre as our bluntness is on another level? 

We don’t see disabilities as a barrier, like ourselves. And we don’t see shame in our disabilities either. I often sign to a friend, “you wanna *push wheel twice*, look around with me?”.  

Otherwise it’d be a bit weird if I had invited you for a walk by demonstrating two legs walking…

Deaf person here. Sign language has implications. The vocabulary is entirely different. It will throw other deaf people off if you use walking because youre not just invoking the image in their head, but physically expressing that image. It's hard to avoid the implication and thinking a certain way when its physically expressed in front of your face. Its like staring at a giraffe without thinking about a giraffe, its just nearly impossible and the cognitive dissonance is real.

Not justifying anyone, just offering a perspective.

My stepdad is in a wheelchair and we use to rolling hands S classified sign to show movement in place of walking whenever we're talking to or about him when I think about it. He's not quite as fluent as me and my mom and sisters so he still uses the walk classifier for himself still sometimes but he really mostly juat uses go instead without the specific classifier showing. I'm sorry your professor was so rude us Deafies can be blunt tho that doesn't make it right. Both are acceptable IMO but I think the level of fluency shows with the various use of handshapes/CL instead of just the literal. ASL (and I'm pretty sure BSL) are visual languages so think about showing not telling if that makes sense. You got this! ♡

Sorry to ""hear"" this happened to you. I've been Deaf my entire life and I've been messed around on every level within the community for countless reasons. ""You're not deaf enough"" by some whose audiograms show that they had way more hearing than I. To be honest with you the entire dialog within the deaf community is pretty confused. Such a big deal made on Deaf with a capital D, although some that scream capital D, can actually hear a lot more than they are letting on. deaf with a little ""d"" who are they to judge? To dehumanize with a cheap prejorative based on an intersectional gripe. The Deaf ""community"" has fallen prone to a classic case of ""lateral violence"" due to overwhelming pressure from the Children of the Greater Gods, pressure to aurvive. Surrounding the Deaf community the access service industrial complex has entered the foray with interpreting services on government contracts of exhortionate pay far outweighing fees earned by deaf professionals. Which of course attracts the ambitious who don't know a thing about linguistic semantics. Ultimately resulting in situations such as your regrettable experience with this so called sign language teacher, who was 100 percent wrong whereas you were 1000 percent correct to state in sign that you ""you went for a walk"" and more power to you!

I’m deaf but I don’t sign so I can’t speak on what signs they have though if she wanted to be literal about it she should have left that question out. There’s nothing wrong with you saying you’re going for a walk in any language, if a baby in a pram is taken for a walk not a stroll or push then why should the term be different for a wheelchair user? I get that the instructor is just trying to teach correct language but not everything is black and white

That was ridiculous.  She was being rude.  I’m sorry you were treated that way.

She’s rude asf.

1mt4ukw,deaf,Anyone else struggling with getting their parent to actually hear you?,"I’m at that stage where I feel more like the “parent” in the relationship. My mom constantly says, “I can hear fine!” but then TV volume is maxed out, phone calls are impossible, and I end up repeating myself three or four times.

It’s not just frustrating  it breaks my heart. I can see her pulling back from conversations at family gatherings because she can’t follow what’s going on. She misses jokes, important details from the doctor, even little everyday things that keep her connected.

I know it’s not her fault, but it wears you down as the caregiver. You’re stuck between not wanting to nag and also worrying about her safety when she can’t hear the doorbell, alarms, or even me from the next room.

Has anyone here found something that actually helped bridge that gap without making them feel “old” or singled out?

You got some really good responses in r/hearingaids so I'll try to not repeat too much of that. 


The bottom line is that you can't force someone to accept their situation if they don't want to. 


I'm sorry to tell you that this is probably not the place for the answers you're looking for. We're deaf, we're cool with it. I personally have a little disdain for people who had good hearing for most of their adult lives but their hubris prevents them from getting hearing aids. Hearing aids didn't do squat for me, due to the nature of my hearing loss. So, stubborn old people get no sympathy from me. 


I do wish you luck for your own sake, the earlier a person gets hearing aids the less difficult it is to adjust to them, thus the better the results. The kind of reclusion you're describing is what will increase the risk of dementia in your mom's later years. It's not the deafness, it's the seclusion from untreated hearing loss. 


Don't listen to the other comments about a specific brand of hearing aids, they've never commented here before, I think it's a bot. Generally speaking the deaf and hard of hearing community is very wary of OTC hearing aids at best and disgusted at worst. If your mom doesn't have Medicare (or veterans affairs) to cover hearing aids, Costco is going to be the best bang for your buck. 


Current/modern BTE (behind the ear) hearing aids are very small and will hide completely behind the ear. The new-ish receiver in canal types just have a little clear tube that goes from the canal to behind the ear. You have to look hard for it to see it.


Again, good luck. If your mom wants to talk tech and discuss tips for being alive while deaf or hard of hearing, this is the right place for that.

There are online apps to test her hearing (make it a game). Then if she sees it rather poor, make her an audiology appointment. The hearing aids now we're so tiny no one notices.  And studies have shown hearing loss leads to limited socialization, and dementia.  Honestly I have cochlear implants and they're big plus the magnet on my head and no one notices.

My mom is awesome she’ll write something down instantly if i don’t hear it, we text and call with InnoCaption somewhat regularly. My only qualm with her is she might ask me something i might not  hear while she’s driving and im in the backseat. She gets it though. My dad though mumbles and is getting old quick, he isn’t as palatable but i understand the reasoning. My gf and friends are similar to my mom just maybe not as quick as her.

It’s great to reach out to all possible sources. I’m a volunteer member of Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA). We teach ourselves and each other how to accept and thrive by learning about HL and what options and tools are available to us. Hearingloss.org has great downloads, including Having the Conversation. 
We learn to be direct and kind with ourselves, each other and those in denial. If you’re in the United States see
If there’s a chapter near you. 
The most important thing is what neurologists have learned. As FluffyDoggie said, untreated hearing loss has been linked to isolation, depression, anxiety, frustration, dementia AND a 30% increase in one’s risk of falling! Just that last fact can put you in the hospital with some pretty serious injuries. Our society is unforgivably hard on people who are different. We have to educate ourselves, each other and the people around us. Your mom is lucky to have you! Adjusting to losing an ability we’ve taken for granted is tough. It’s much
Easier with support from those who love us! Good luck to you both.

1msw5vg,deaf,What do you worry about AI ASL in the future more than bringing interpreter?,"Some deaf community hated AI ASL on the internet which is malfunctioning and slowing in the difficulty time. Other people favor in the real interpreter in class or bringing to the doctor or ASL interpreter TV. Worrying, the doctor did not experience to set up for ASL interpreter on TV and out of time. In similar, AI generated ASL on TV would cause problem with missing and not functioning properly. I can believe deaf people can get frustrated and delay the long time. Many company want to expand AI ASL maybe. 

In Kenya, some deaf community disagree the company invested with AI Kenyan SL expanding to classes, doctors and more.

Keep in mind not all countries have the same access to services we have here in the USA. For some countries it’s either ai terp or nothing.

Ai will never replace important role ASL interpreters have, a cultural interpretation and adjusting to match deaf individuals level of understanding. In ideal world, if deaf person have limited understanding, or limited hands ability, you'd have deaf interpreter to clarify for interpreter to voice anything, then same other way around. Its the most accurate way to interpret in a way deaf person will be able to understand. 

But it's not happening unless theres availability. 

In some countries; its probably better than absolutely nothing. I heard that in Philippines that they'd have to pay for deaf interpreters out of pocket! So for them, Ai interpreters are probably going to save money for important things. But people need to understand that the value of having a human present will make things more clear and quicker than trusting AI.

Are you talking about VRI or AI? AI interpreter is a long way in the future

Hi! If you are an app developer and would like to promote your app on r/deaf, please check check with the moderators first! Please disregard this if that isn't the case. Thank you!

i'm so curious too!!!!

Search airport terms in this sub? Call TSA Cares for an attendant through security. Let the gate agent know and sit in the disabled seats. Let the airline know so they can mark deaf on your boarding pass.

If you have specific questions, we can give specific answers.

Well, what languages do you know, where are you from, and which parts of SEA do you plan to visit? 


What specific barriers caused by being hard of hearing or deaf are you hoping to overcome with an app?

where will you go?

The FLIO app can be very helpful at airports. Likewise check the airport website as they have other useful tools (e.g. Messenger chatbots that can send you updates on your gate).

https://www.flio.com

Microsoft Translator can provide live captions of conversations as well as translation.

Make sure you have decent data roaming/local SIM on your phone as you may be relying on it more than most travellers. Likewise a battery pack to keep it charged.

An app for the airline(s) you're travelling on and Google Translate should be just fine. What else could one possibly need?",2025-08-17 05:12:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1msi8ji/traveling_app/

If your hearing family rejects you because you're deaf, you're not the only one. 


Sometimes, this is just part of the deaf life experience. If you're the only deaf person in a hearing family rejection happens, sometimes. 


I'm not sure about the point of your post. Do you want advice? I suggest moving away and finding your own deaf people to be like family.

this is sadly the case for a lot of us, im rly sorry about this and wish i could offer support.

There’s so many people who don’t keep in contact with their family because family can be really awful like this. Love to you, friend. 
Many of us find people instead who are chosen family. These are people who aren’t your blood relatives but are people who are your dearest friends and closest people.

1msb1rj,deaf,Do you use two phones (one for VP and one for text)? Curious about mix-ups.,"My wife is a sign language interpreter, so through her work and Deaf friends I’ve gotten to see some of the unique challenges in everyday communication. One thing I’ve noticed is that a lot of Deaf/HoH people carry two phones — one for video calls (VP/VRS) and one for text.

It seems like there are often mix-ups where someone texts the VP number by mistake, or calls the text number when they’re really supposed to video call. That sounds frustrating and confusing to manage.

I’m exploring whether there might be a simple solution — like having one public number that automatically routes video calls to VP and texts to your text phone, so you don’t have to keep correcting people or juggling two numbers.

I wanted to ask:

Do you run into this problem often?

How do you usually deal with it?

Would having a “one number” solution be useful, or not really?

If something like this existed, would you see it more for personal use (family/friends) or business use (clients, work contacts)?


I’m not trying to sell anything right now — just want to learn from the community and see if this idea makes sense before I even think about building it.

Thanks for any thoughts you share 🙏

[댓글]
Yes, there is an already existing easy solution — I use my cell phone (text only) number for everything and set it to call forwarding so whenever someone calls that, it automatically gets sent to my VP number. 

No need to build anything. iPhones and androids already do this.

Also why are they carrying 2 phones???? Most people just use the VRS app on their already existing phone.

Look man. In my email signature I have both my VP and my text numbers, clearly labeled, and then in parentheses after each I add that (this is a landline that does not accept texts) and that (this is a text-only number). I still get emails from hearing people berating me for “ignoring” them when they’re the ones who cannot understand the most simple things. Sometimes the problem is not us or our technologies, but the inability and unwillingness of hearing people to get with the program. 

The fact is that our having these separate numbers is really not that different from hearing people having multiple numbers—a work number and a personal number. If a hearing person tells you to call or text them with a particular number, then sure they’d be frustrated too if everyone kept using the wrong one. 

It’s simply people being unconscientious/careless.

I use InnoCaption instead of VRS, but yes I have a similar problem. If only relay providers such as captioned phone and VRS could support text messages I'd only ever give out my InnoCaption number. 


The partial solution I have is to give our only my Google voice number but I never answer it, it just goes to voicemail,  then I call them back with InnoCaption is I call them back at all.

I don’t have two phones. Lol. I do have a VP number and a text number. I’m kinda over it. 

We do not have the technology to have one number like hearing folks without needing extra steps yet. I’m not gonna sign up with multiple applications and wait for installers to arrive in their own time when I got to work. Blech. 

No need to be a hearing savior and invent the wheel though. I’m fine.🤣

I have two phone numbers and one phone. When people call my regular number I text with I have it forward the call to my innocaption number.

my parents have a home video phone which is connected to their iPads as well. they also have their own cell phones for texting and facetime",2025-08-16 23:15:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1msb1rj/do_you_use_two_phones_one_for_vp_and_one_for_text/
1ms6ei5,deaf,Preschool Teacher V.S. Hearing Aids,"Im not severely hard of hearing. My last test shows Mild loss as of 2 years ago. When I talk to people, I can understand what they’re saying but every now and then it sounds like all the words have grouped together and they need to repeat themselves. I got hearing aids 2 years ago before I became a teacher and interacted with kids on the daily. But because of my migraines, I stopped wearing them as they were a big trigger for them. And next week I’m getting custom molds. I decided to start wearing them again to get used to them before my molds come in. 

I teach 3-5 year olds. We have anywhere from 20-30 kids in the class in the day. And my god. Too. Many. Sounds. 

I’ve learned they’re little baby voices and how to tell what they’re saying by now. I can differentiate all their indistinct voices and know which one is shouting “teacher!” Without looking at them.

With my hearing aids on, the only thing that was different was all the added sounds. All the crying at nap being louder. 

Every little footstep running around the class. 

Every little magna-tile hitting the table.

Every little hand smacking the table. Or scratching their shirts. 

Every little squeal as they play. 

Or every little cry when their toy is taken by another kids. 

All the bikes on the playground. 

The digging of sand. 

All of it was too much and I started to panic, how do people handle all these noises? This was insane.

I feel ya. I only wear my hearing aids for conversation, music and screentime. If I'm by myself in Walmart, they're out. I've never heard anyone say they like or miss the sound of department stores. What people don't get is that what are sounds for them, is noise for us. Who wants to have noise blasted into their ears that they can't get away from.

Talk to your audiologist about this. It’s their job help you get used to the sound. Maybe even show them exactly what you wrote here, since it’s well described.

It’s now wonder the brain gets overwhelmed by all the new sounds it hasn’t heard for a long time. You do get used to it, and it’s very much consistent use that’s necessary.

With that said… well, it’s complex. The first thing you should do, is reduce the volume during noisy times, especially in the beginning. Reducing the volume temporarily is much better than removing the hearing aids, because you can restore it when it’s quieter or when you want to talk to someone. Second thing you should do, is an in ear measurement to double check that the settings are optimal for how you hear. The third thing, is to maybe ask the audiologist for a specific program that could reduce noise a bit more at work. A forth option, is trying a different hearing aid model to see if you prefer the way they process sound. You’ll still have to work on getting used to the sound, but sometimes a different hearing aid brand has a sound that works better for you.

Unfortunately, there are limits to hearing aids and CIs. Any hearing technology with a microphone, works best if the speaker is close to the microphone and there is no background noise. Personally, I can’t interpret speech unless I’m in such good listening conditions. I think many HoH with moderate or severe hearing loss, simply wouldn’t cope in a preschool setting. If you can figure out ways to learn sign language and work at a preschool that does use signing, then I would recommend doing that. Don’t push yourself to stay in over difficult environments. If that’s out of the question, at least look for options where you maybe have smaller groups wiggles noise. Also consider other options to use your skills in a way that exposes you to less noise. Maybe consider to study again and get a different degree? Try to broaden your perspective. Most importantly, do meet other HoH to get an impression of how they handle their work life. You’ll meet those who cope well, and those who don’t. Learn from that.

I have the signia hearing aids and I use the app to fine tune the program to teach it to block out background noises

Turn down the volume on your hearing aids to something you can tolerate, and over time slowly increase it to whatever your default is set to.",2025-08-16 20:15:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ms6ei5/preschool_teacher_vs_hearing_aids/
1ms45ew,deaf,Concert,"Hi everyone,

I have been completely deaf in my left ear since birth. Soon I'm going to a concert at the Ziggo Dome. Normally I wear a CROS hearing aid, but I leave it at home: the device works as an amplifier, all sound from the left device comes in to the right and does not dissolve anything on the left.

During a concert, sound for 1 side would be too loud. However, the combination of a headphone protection and hearing aids dampens the sound of the hearing aids in me. Apart from that, it is not good.

I want to protect my ""good"" ear, but I'm afraid that hearing protection (even with filters) makes it difficult to hear the music and the audience. Through contact with the Ziggo Dome they offer to get the sound directly via a wireless receiver (3.5 mm mini-jack), with headphones. This requires permission from the tour production.

If that does not work, I prefer to look for earplugs myself or headphones that protect my right ear and have a 3.5 mm cable that can be connected to that receiver. If I can't, I have protection. I mainly find equipment for artists online, but nothing that fits this situation. Who has experience or a tip for such a tool? I can't really find anything through hearing aids etc.

All in all: I am looking for a 2-in-1 earplugs (and otherwise a headphone) that serve as a hearing protection and amplifier via connection. Then I can put it on my hearing, working ear. This way I can control the volume myself, with sufficient protection, without being isolated from the atmosphere in the room and at the same time with the music.

I'm afraid it will be different between following music badly or having no protection and destroying my one ear.

Thanks for thinking along!! ",2025-08-16 18:52:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ms45ew/concert/
1mrz7hd,deaf,Questions for Teachers for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing,"\*Crossposted with r/specialed. I didn't get any replies from teachers of the D/HH there, so I thought I'd ask here.

Hi! I want to start off by saying, I'm not a teacher (yet). I'm merely interested in the profession as a career change. I am wanting to pursue a master's in Deaf Education. I, myself, am hard of hearing but I was mainstreamed in school and never had access to a teacher for the Deaf so I have questions.

* This probably sounds like a red flag question but here goes: What exactly does a teacher for the Deaf do? What is your primary function?
* 2) What does a typical day look like for you?
* 3) What's one thing you wish you'd known before becoming a teacher? And what's one thing you wish you'd known before you became a teacher for the Deaf specifically? Preferably something you didn't learn in school.
* 4) Is there **any** reason you'd warn somebody off from becoming a teacher for the deaf? I already know many of the reasons not to become a teacher, in general. I have a lot of teacher friends who have left the profession. lol
* 5) What are the pros and cons of being itinerant vs. campus based?
* 6) Anything else you feel necessary to share with me?

A few things about me:

1. I'm hard of hearing but get by well enough when using my hearing aids.
2. I'm only interested in the profession (teacher for the Deaf/HH) specifically or being a core subject teacher at a Deaf school. I want to specifically work with Deaf/HH children/teens because I want to work with kids who are Deaf/HH like me.
3. I'm familiar with hearing aids and other assistive tech. Not so much cochlear implants, though.
4. I know some ASL.

\*I was language deprived as I was not given the opportunity to learn ASL as a child. I've done well for myself having only ever been exposed to English during my developmental years. I am learning now and am in an interpreter training program so that I can get to a high level of proficiency both for my benefit (so I can use interpreters at big events, concerts, lectures, etc.) and for future career aspirations. I'm not really a candidate for being an interpreter as I'm HH myself but I felt like that was the best way to get as fluent as possible.

I’m a teacher of the Deaf:
1. I teach them. Many of my students have multiple learning needs, so I have a lot of Individual Education Plans (IEPs) which I plan around. I studied and teach a bilingual/bicultural philosophy of teaching the Deaf and HoH, which means learning and communication is done in ASL and English is taught as a second language through reading and writing. 

2. Typical day: 
Come in and set up class for the day
Greet students
Hold “morning meeting” session to check in and go over the day. 
Subject class (usually I do reading/writing in the morning when they’re fresh)
Play time
Math
Lunch
History (I focus on Deaf history and Deaf Civil Rights in my year)
Play time
Science
Prep for home
Go home 

3. I actually volunteered in a Deaf school since I was 12. My masters in Deaf Ed was frustrating and tedious, but being in the classroom is everything. That said, in general (for any teacher) plan on 2 hours of planning for every one hour lesson you will teach. When you’re a new teacher, it may take even longer. And sometimes kids just won’t connect with the way you’re teaching, so you have to be flexible and have backup plans. This though is the case for teaching all kids and is not specific to Deaf children. 

4. I would warn anyone who is interested in either “saving”/“fixing” Deaf children or who isn’t committed to signing with their kids away from teaching them. Deaf and HoH kids will hear that they are broken from society a million times, but they absolutely should not get that message from their teachers. If you aren’t 100% committed to uplifting them and fighting for them, then don’t do it. They don’t need more garbage in their lives. 

5. I’ve always been campus based so I can’t compare. I love watching my babies grow not only through my year but as they move forward. Every year when my former students who are now all bit and amazing graduate I cry because they amaze me. I have never not been amazed at the changes they undergo in school. 

6. Choose the teaching philosophy you’re going with and get a master’s in that. Interpreting is great, but you need to learn how to teach, which is a totally different and very specific skill set.

I am not a ToD but I did attend a toxic and abusive oral deaf school so I strongly advise you to avoid working in one of those places.

This reads like a college assignment, FYI.

If you want to improve your ASL, find an ASL program, not interpreting. Perhaps Deaf Studies, ASL Studies, or even just taking ASL classes will get you in a better place for teaching. Also, make sure your graduate program aligns with the bi-bi (or multi-multi) philosophy. Many programs don't align with this philosophy.

I’m HoH and took a teachers degree in 2023 and did my internship at a Deaf school. The best time of my life! I returned to my old engineering job afterwards, for job security reasons, since the number of students in Deaf schools is declining, and I don’t want to work in a hearing school. 

1) This probably sounds like a red flag question but here goes: What exactly does a teacher for the Deaf do? What is your primary function?

In my country, they rarely meet students. Their role is more to provide training and guidance to those teachers who have Deaf and HoH children in their classes. They support the teachers and follow-up the academic and social development of the Deaf and HoH students. They are often responsible for a whole county or area and visit the schools where there are students in this category. They work to create a good school environment for the children, help identifying resources when needed, and get more involved where there is a need to.


2) What does a typical day look like for you?

When I was teaching at the Deaf school, it was a regular teaching job, with a lot of time in the classroom, in meetings and preparation. The classes were small, and many of the students were in need of a lot of support, due to poor school experiences before coming to this school. Few of the teachers were fully Deaf from birth, but many had ok signing skills. Interpreters were used both by hearing teachers in Deaf classes and by Deaf teachers in HoH classes. What surprised me a lot, was that the students were happy to interact across borders, and Deaf and HoH did often want to get to know the other group. There could be kids with CI in a Deaf class who hear much better than me, and there could be kids in the HoH class who actually preferred to sign. This is a new thing, since there has been such a strong division between those groups historically. It was the students who pushed the school to have classes together occasionally.

3) What's one thing you wish you'd known before becoming a teacher? And what's one thing you wish you'd known before you became a teacher for the Deaf specifically? Preferably something you didn't learn in school.

Nothing really. I’m old enough to have had a pretty realistic picture of the school world. I don’t think I understood exactly how lonely the Deaf and HoH students are in regular schools. I thought there was more support than there is. I didn't know how difficult it is to get into a Deaf school. I would very much like to see a change, where it’s more about language and open to anyone, instead of having a special needs focus.


4) Is there any reason you'd warn somebody off from becoming a teacher for the deaf? I already know many of the reasons not to become a teacher, in general. I have a lot of teacher friends who have left the profession. lol

Not really, I think it’s a super important profession, and that good teachers are so badly needed. We have a limited number of hours in our life before we die, and it’s important for us to spend those hours on things we find meaningful, rewarding and important. Any profession can be tough, so it’s a lot about reflecting on your own priorities and goals in life.

5) What are the pros and cons of being itinerant vs. campus based?

Being campus based, gives a better opportunity to get to know the students. Relationship and advocacy skills are always important, but even more so if being itinerant.

6) Anything else you feel necessary to share with me?

Always be curious and keep learning! Look for good teaching around you. Use your enthusiasm and curiosity when teaching. Regularly evaluate what’s important and meaningful for you personally, and then make plans that move you towards that.

Same as u are as teachers in different teaching or specialties teaching who are disabled students  , only difference is sign language that it  other than that students are deaf / hoh / disabled / handicapped  that it. That only difference.

I’ve only taught at a Deaf school (I don’t teach anymore but still work at the school), but I know from my current job that each RDSPD is different. Some are doing great, while some are severely understaffed and low on resources. I typically see this more in rural school districts for obvious reasons. A large majority of students that go to my school are parent-referred, not district-referred, and for those who came from mainstream/RDSPD backgrounds, it’s often because they’re from schools with limited resources. That can be a frustrating experience for teachers, I’m sure.

I've been a school librarian, preschool teacher, tutor, substitute teacher, and daycare worker. I have a younger brother who's profoundly Deaf, grandfather who's HI, and I have brain damage that makes auditory processing difficult. 

My main advice would be to become as proficient in ASL as you can, even outside the confines of your formal education. Learning any language takes considerable time, effort, and immersion and any deficiency you have opens you up to prejudgment/mockery from your students. Keep in mind that more than a few of them have experiences with interpreters who know only a relative handful of signs and/or interpreters who treat it as more of a gig than a profession.

I have proactively approved this post. As always mod approval does not imply endorsement.

I'm a student who's being ""supported"" by a ToD so I hope it's okay to comment (I'm in the UK but it's very similar)

Just because my loss is classified as ""mild"" does not mean these things

I have been thinking a lot about my use of piano in class lately.  I know that I can notice a difference in listening to a digital piano and an acoustic piano.  Certainly vibration plays a role in this. I know I can feel a difference in the quality of vibration between the two, but I'm not sure if some of that comes from the audio signal I'm hearing or the physical phenomenon of vibration itself (not to get too caught up in the definitions here).  I am curious if any in the deaf and hard of hearing community can chime in on this.  Would I make a difference (even if small) of using an acoustic instrument or is the difference too small to matter?  I understand the role frequency plays in this, I suppose I am just looking for general range. I also understand that everyone has a different experience.  It would be great to hear a few viewpoints.

1mqxe6t,deaf,Pet peeve: YouTube videos where there's only sometimes subtitles.,"You know those videos where the creator of the video was kind enough to write the subtitles for the video, but only in some parts? That *really* bothers me, because that means I have to constantly enable/disable closed captions (CC) because sometimes the subtitles are there, then other times they're not. I have to disable the CC whenever there are already subtitles on screen, otherwise the CC blocks the actual subtitles.

This usually happens when I watch a true crime video. The creator of the video adds subtitles when a person in the video is speaking, but then when the narrator starts speaking, there are no subtitles and I have to enable the CC again. Then the video switches to a person speaking again, and the subtitles appear again. So I have to disable CC *again*.

This also sometimes happens in interviews, where there are subs present when the person being interviewed speaks, but then disappear again once the interviewer starts speaking/asking questions.

Why can't these content creators just add subtitles for the entire video???? Like if you plan on having subtitles for certain parts of the video, then you might as well write subtitles for the *entire* thing. CC are rarely reliable, so I would prefer not to have to use them at all.

I've been fighting AI captioning in conference calls for a long time. They are mostly accurate, but they occasionally get sidetracked and make stuff up. The big problem is, unless you are lucky, or the AI goes really wild, you will never know when it's correct or not. I come with a solution!

Just last night I found out about RCC (Remote Conference Captioning) usually offered for free by your state's TTY relay operator.

This morning I did my first RCC conference call, and it was great!

I don't know who figured out this path and got the state's relay operator to commit, but I'm a huge fan. Thank you to whoever was involved in that! I'll buy you lunch someday, if you tell me the story of how it came to be, I'm curious!

Anyways, if you are like me and tired of AI captioning in your conference call meetings, give RCC a try.

If you do a web search for Remote Conference Captioning and your state name, you should be able to find it easily enough. I've only checked a few states, but all of them offered it free of charge. Hopefully yours does too!

Is there a specific website I'm looking for?   I'd be interested.    
  
I use Zoom in Google Canary and Teams in regular Google Chrome.  AI Captioning is 99.9% accurate and never had an issue with it.  Sometimes there's a person speaking that the live captioning has no idea what to do with, but I've found that the other people in the call also don't know what the person is saying.  I've tried a number of things but they've been too delayed to be useful to me, but I'd be interested in learning about RCC.",2025-08-15 01:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mqk707/remote_conference_captioning_human_captioning_of/

1mq2tay,deaf,“You’re so lucky you can’t hear…”,"I am so overly frustrated with people telling me that I’m lucky I can’t hear things. Most of the time I try to be polite, but yesterday my daughter (4) was having a full blown meltdown while me and a buddy were grabbing some party stuff for her friends birthday. She was trying to ask me something but she didn’t know the sign, and I couldn’t tell what she was asking. She understandably got frustrated, and melt down. Right about then my buddy who can hear comes back, helps me figure out she’s asking if we got a gift for her friend, and then tells me “you’re so lucky you can’t hear her screaming. I could hear it like 3 isles over.” 

In that moment I felt so defeated and overwhelmed. I know it happens but in that moment dealing with the dealing of utter failure (which I have felt before I went deaf with my other children) I wanted to just explode!

[댓글]
I'm HoH and I've had the same comment before. Another one that hurts after hearing from my own family was ""I wish you could just figure out that hearing problem."" As if it's within my control to fix it.

Your options are to ignore those comments or convey to them how that makes you feel but either way you'll need to be prepared to get comments like that.

This was said to me in so many different contexts after losing my hearing and it drives me bananas. To me it’s like telling someone who’s mom died that they’re so lucky they save money not having to buy her birthday gifts any more.

They just don't know how it really is being not able to hear sounds at all. Sorry you heard that but sadly ignorant people are everywhere. I‘d force them to wear earplugs all day and make them apologise

As a person with hearing problems I can say I used this occasion to study more the human mind. The sad truth is as long you are not in it you can’t fully understand how crappy it is and how many other facets of this problem are.

*good thing I can't hear shit that is coming out of your mouth because you are not much of a help*

It sucks. 


I will say, as someone who can hear i can understand the sentiment, in the moment. It would be like your eyes hurting after someone shines a very bright light into them, or like your legs aching after standing all day. It's not about not wanting to hear, see, or stand but more about not wanting the painful parts of those abilities. 


I've had these thoughts, when my tinnitus gets so loud it physically hurts me. I tend to be alone and or not in the mood to talk when it happens (who wants to communicate when they are in pain) but I've thought about how if I could never experience the pain again I might trade my hearing. Once the pain is gone, I realize how dumb it is, but for that few seconds/minutes of pain I certainly contemplate stabbing my ear in the hope of stopping the sound.


That isn't to say it doesn't hurt when others say it, or that they shouldn't say things like that. It's just to say that they aren't thinking about the good things hearing allows them, they are just thinking about the inconvenience and/or pain they feel at the moment.

Yeah, as a fully Deaf person, I'd say there are times when it can be lucky,  but this definitely wasn't one of those times. Lucky would be being able to sleep through heavy construction road work during the daytime when you've got a night shift.
  Not being able to communicate properly with loved ones.

I hate it when people tells me that I am so lucky that my parents can sign. While I am grateful that my parents can sign but I refused to consider myself as lucky because it’s not fair to other people whose parents doesn’t sign.

The one I hate is when people tell me I'm so lucky I don't have to work and ""get paid to be deaf"" (I get disability)

But you know what? I have learned we are quite lucky. I honestly don't want full hearing. I can't imagine how maddening it must be to be able to hear sounds like electricity humming or bugs outside at night. I can spend the night in a city near busy roads or train tracks and get wicked cheap deals, and not be troubled by the noise in the least

I'm quite content being able to mute the world for bed every night, personally lol

I missed having hearing for awhile until I figured out that I could sit in crowded restaurants and have a nice quiet meal. My hearing friends would sit there uncomfortable af and be like I'm getting a headache. I'd say let's leave early then.

Those times people would say things like that I would roll my eyes at them. It's like saying to someone that is blind you're so lucky you don't have to see how bad people treat each other. People think it's being cute or something and it's just not.

Due the nature of how I lost my hearing I'm just grateful to be alive and have part of my working memory intact and have the ability to learn ASL, relearning English is going to be very hard.",2025-08-14 14:50:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mq2tay/youre_so_lucky_you_cant_hear/
1mpz7qd,deaf,Unusually Accommodating Hospital,"My spouse had surgery yesterday and the hospital experience was. incredible. She’s fine, no complications, she’s recovering at home. 

To start, my wife has been to a couple consult appointments without me. I’ve called the surgeons office using an IP relay several times. I only met the doctor right before surgery. Her chart said she needed an ASL interpreter instead of me. The pre-op nurse got that sorted fairly quick. Basically, I can direct my HA and read lips well enough in a quiet environment, but I would ask for a terp if I need it. I think one of the office staff just heard a female operator on the phone during a call and assumed I was the patient and made a note in her file. 

Every interaction with hospital staff started with discussing my communication preference.  The nurse made sure to turn and face me to talk as she was leading me to the waiting area. The doctor pulled me into a side room from the waiting room to debrief the surgery. The post op nurse pulled down their mask when talking to us. I had a note on my phone to pick up meds from the pharmacy. The pharmacist read the note, went to get the meds, and came back with the meds and a VRI interpreter so we could fully discuss the drugs. 

Front to back, the entire hospital made sure I had access during my wife’s treatment. I know a lot of people have opposite experiences with healthcare. Keep your chin up. Some hospitals have taken communication access seriously. 

[댓글]
That’s awesome! The clinic/hospital I go to is extremely accommodating. I have a flag on my account (they put it there, it was not requested by me,) so each and every time I’m there, there’s an interpreter waiting. No hassles, no nothing. It’s always a good experience as far as communication goes. (I felt bad one time when I had a 4-hour surgery, the interpreter stayed and waited the entire time. I hope she brought her phone or a book 🙂)

This is so nice to hear! Hopefully your spouse's recovery is easy &amp; quick!

If you can leave them a favorable review.

I had a great experience recently too getting surgery. In the intake form they asked if I needed an interpreter (I didn't but it was good to see it was available). They said I could keep my hearing aids on until I went into the op room, I got them back in recovery straight away and they all took their masks off when talking to me. After my surgery the nurse handing over to nightshift told the next nurse to make sure they were looking at me when talking to me. Was really surprised as friends have had bad experiences.

Amazing your wife has no complaints or problems and is now recovering from home.

Also amazing for the hospital doing very well communicate with you and your wife.

Drop the name!!

I’m so happy to hear that! An accommodating heathcare facility seems to be a rarity, I’m glad that was your experience.

I recently had a similar ish experience. I went to the ER for a migraine and the doctor made sure to face me and speak clearly with eye contact during the entire interaction. I’m not sure if this was just his normal way of interacting or if he noticed my HAs but I was grateful nonetheless.

That’s great! When I had my daughter they didn’t believe me I couldn’t hear them.

Wow that is great! I am researching communication access for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in the medical setting. From what I researched and seen/experienced that has not always been the case.

Yes, ive heard of RTT but that doesnt seem to be an option in my phones settings. ive searched high and low for any RTT features in all of my settings but nowhere to be found. only live captions for audio. is that the same thing?  
if you are not deaf and you dont use the TTY feature on your iphone,  kindly DONT reply. no offense. i need an experienced person to walk me through this.

[댓글]
To troubleshoot, you need to be a lot clearer about what you are doing, what # are you calling exactly? What garbled text are you getting back?

Some background information about this, that may help:

You need to call the TTY number for your relay operator(711 typically) or organization you are calling.

Think of TTY as like a fax machine. Assuming you are old enough to know what that is ;)

For instance, you can TTY directly to the IRS: 

https://www.irs.gov/help/let-us-help-you

&gt; Callers who are hearing impaired
TTY/TDD 800-829-4059

so you would dial that number directly to reach the IRS, instead of going through a relay operator.

For relay operators, i.e. to call someone that doesn't have a direct TTY number, you have to call through a TTY relay operator. In the USA you do that by calling 711 on your TTY (so on your iPhone). Then you tell the TTY operator the phone # for them to call for you.

Some 711 info: https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/711-telecommunications-relay-service and linked from there: https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/telecommunications-relay-service-trs

TTY has a short hand, to reduce typing and confusion. Because it's a shared state line. ""GA""  for (Go Ahead), OPR: to tell the operator something, SK SK to mean you are done communicating(literally means stop keying, stop keying), etc.  More info via the AZ govt: https://www.acdhh.org/telecommunications/relay-services/711-information/

Many people, especially younger ones, don't use TTY much anymore. They use VRS, or a video relay, where they sign ASL to their relay operator instead of typing. To do that requires an application specific to that relay operator, such as Purple, Sorenson, etc.

There is also t-mobile IP relay, which is basically the same as calling 711 using TTY, but uses the Internetl(IP protocol), has a friendly app, can be done over a web page, etc.

I’ve never successfully used the TTY feature. I use an IP relay or innocaption.

Same thing happens to me. I was never able to find a good explanation.

Have you looked at the options under Settings—&gt;Accessibility—&gt;RTT/TTY (it shows up under the Hearing heading for me).

I had a TTY as a younger kid in the early 90's and as a younger adult in the early 00s. I no longer use TTY or IP relay. I prefer using (Ntouch app)Sorenson VP on my iPad and on my Android phone when I'm not at home. I also have the Nagish app.

Turn your phone off and back on again, if you haven’t already

I HIGHLY recommend an app called Nagish.  Before, talking on the phone was not an option for me, now I can do it easily.",2025-08-13 21:39:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mphim8/tty_calls_on_my_iphone_are_garbled_text_please/

[댓글]
I really don't care how you label yourself.  In my opinion if you want to be around people with hearing loss, need help, or just want to vent .  Then yes you belong here.

Hearing people label us, the last thing our culture needs is people pointing at each other saying OMG they are not Deaf!

It's up to you to define your label.


We aren't the ones who are going to tell you how you should call yourself or if you belong somewhere. You are the one who have to figure out this for you, since it's part of your identity. We can help with some parts of it, though.


If you feel that deaf fit you and feels comfortable with it, then great. If you feel that hard of hearing fit you better, then great. Using deaf really doesn't mean that you are 100% deaf, deafness is a spectrum.

Probably wouldn’t say deaf per se based on the title. Usually that’s more reserved for profound hearing loss… mild means you can hear without but with difficulty which I would classify as hard of hearing. 

Needless to say, you do belong here…

You can decide where you are in the community and where you are in the spectrum of labels. But if youre like me, and grew up hearing, have diagnosed mild to moderate hearing loss, have issues understanding speech sometimes, wear hearing aids sometimes, have chronic ear problems that can be uncomfy like tinnitus/pressure problems/irritation, or live mostly in the hearing world but find it increasingly difficult as your hearing undergoes changes, you might find that referring to yourself as hard of hearing makes sense. 

The hard of hearing label really feels right for me at the moment and has helped me explain to people that yes I may need some minor accommodations even though I can still technically hear them. Sometimes I say things like ""I am mostly deaf in one ear"" or ""I am partially deaf"" but hard of hearing is really the term for what I am. I can hear, but it's hard!

But I also know that not all hard of hearing people share my exact experiences. It's all a spectrum, and no one understands your particular situation as well as you do, so you're the authority on whether or not you are deaf! How do you feel? What do you want to be? Have you learned about Deaf (capital D) culture, and if so, how does that make you feel? Why would you feel bad to call yourself deaf? These are questions you should answer yourself. And the answers may change over time! And that's okay! 

Best of luck :) You are gonna be fine no matter where you land. This community is awesome and will be happy to help you.

People here are confusing Deaf and deaf…. You ARE deaf!! IF that’s how you want to identify! Ignore the cliqueness going on here. You deserve to be here. I had mild hearing loss that is now moderate-severe. I was deaf then and I’m deaf now! Fuck everyone else who tried to tell you otherwise.

If you hear without hearing aids you have hearing problems, if you are hearing voice even with hearing aids then you a deaf and if you cannot be helped with no tech we humans invented then you are stone deaf or colloquially knows as a “stoner”.

Deaf means can't hear. If you have hearing loss no matter how much you can hear, you are deaf. But you can label yourself HoH if you prefer that way.

You are HOH, not deaf.",2025-08-13 20:14:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mpfb1x/mild_hearing_loss/

1mouckm,deaf,Unilateral deafness due to Mumps,"Hello everyone,
I am a 27-year-old male. I have had unilateral deafness in my left ear since I was 10 years old. Currently, I work in a fast-paced hospital setting, and the problem I face is that I often have to ask my seniors to repeat themselves if they speak to me from my left side. This has upset some seniors because I frequently have to say “Pardon me.”

I was told that, since I have been completely deaf in my left ear due to mumps since childhood, hearing aids are not a feasible option. What can I do to overcome this problem?

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions, as I have been facing extreme difficulty at work due to my hearing problem.


[댓글]
I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and hard of hearing in the other. I have a hearing aid. It’s a BiCros, with a mic on my deaf side and the receiver on the other (that is also a hearing aid on that side). 

I don’t know if that would help much in a chaotic hospital situation. The hearing aids do amplify sounds, but it’s also difficult to know exactly where the sound is coming from because it all goes to the same ear. But technology is always evolving, so it’s possible that there’s something out there that might help.

Around when I was born I somehow gotten a bad case of ecoli and I was hospitalized for a while. It made me partially deaf in my left ear and I do notice I have trouble hearing a lot in that ear even my right ear is getting some hearing loss. I had hearing aids before mostly the over the ear ones but they are so god damn small I also ending up losing them. Back in 2023 I purchased the 2nd gen’s AirPods Pro (I also gotten the 14 pro max as well) and ever since Apple released their hearing aid mode I’ve been using that.

Hearing aids are expensive asf but there are over the counter hearing aids that are a lot cheaper (including AirPods Pro 2nd gen) and I remember Bose used to make their own but they sold them to a different company (i forgot the name). Senniheiser (idk how to spell it) also makes an hearing aid as well (might get them).

Have you been evaluated for cochlear implants? My understanding is people who develop unilateral deafness later in life (""later"" as in after you developed hearing and spoken language comprehension), there's a chance you would respond okay to a CI.

Only your audiologist and ENT will be able to tell you for sure if a CI would work for you, and only you can decide if you're willing to go through surgery like that and the ensuing mental ""ear"" training you will need to undergo for your brain to adjust to the CI.  But it is one option that you should be aware of.",2025-08-13 04:00:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mouckm/unilateral_deafness_due_to_mumps/

So you have a Right to Inclusive Education: Under the Dutch law, schools are legally obligated to provide reasonable accommodations. 

I would get a letter from your doctor and take it to your school's disability/care coordinator and request a meeting to discuss a support plan. Have a think about what accommodations would allow you to complete your assignments. 

For example: 
-Completing assignments on your own in a quiet room with headphones
-Visual cues and written notations 
-Subtitles for lyrics
-Teacher uses hand cues for group projects 
-Alternative assignments 

I’d recommend going through the formal accommodation request process rather than just mentioning it to the teacher, so your needs are officially documented and supported. You should not be penalised!

I don't know where in the world you are but you need to be pushing for accommodations. These are in many nations your legal right. You need to go with your parents too the school to discuss this matter, and discuss with the school how to put accommodations in place so you can do your best in a fair way!

Good luck!

Deaf here, went to mainstream schools. I was a former band kid with music classes for 7 years during both primary and secondary education. I also communicate primarily in American Sign Language since I’m based in the US. Everything my instructor taught me was interpreted in ASL.

Not sure what regulations Dutch laws have specifically but you should at least be able to contact your doctor and bring a letter to your counselor/disability support coordinator.

That alone should give you accessibility to necessary accommodations such as studying/practicing in a quiet room to identify the music scales, rhythm and sound at your preferred volume level, or even dropping the class. 

If you want to continue the music class, below are some accommodations examples you might consider requesting for your music class. What instrument are you playing or practicing on? I’m happy to give more detailed suggestions of accommodations you could request.

For me, I had a patient band director who used a lot of visual techniques to stay focused in the music we practiced. They made my experience quite enjoyable but I can’t say that it was easy.

There are music directors who will do conducting motions (hand signals) throughout the song as the band plays on their instruments. You might notice them standing at the front of the band on a raised platform and flailing their arms around— they are hand signals to help keep count of the rhythm and how to play the scales: loudly, quietly, slow down, go faster, etc. 

You can ask your instructor if they are willing to go over conducting motions, and what they mean. Having a uniform sense of direction is a good place to start. I added a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/eyDH9hHFge8?si=6mOVAEG_4KpCxL07) that does a good explanation of different conducting motions and how to identify them. 

You can also use a metronome, which a counting device that follows the pace of the beats per minute (bpm). This was something I used frequently to track how fast the song is played.

Music can be visual and tactile. If listening to the music is difficult, ask your instructor to print the music sheet of the song and learn how to read the scales. You can use the metronome to help set the beats per minute to see how fast it goes.

It seems like your teacher was presenting an analytical music theory assignment. I could never actually hear the music, so I was very reliant on feeling the beat — literally. Headphones are no good to me, and I will instead play the music on a speaker at the highest possible volume that makes the floor vibrate. The speakers will be turned up to 100% and I’ll just put my hand over it to feel the music. (Sorry to all the hearing people that had their ears bleeding out for 10 minutes.)

In this way, I was able to identify and analyze the different musical characteristics such as the emotions, rhythm, intonation, style, dynamics, articulation, etc. But I only can’t identify what music scale they played it on if I didn’t read the conductor’s sheets. Was it G minor or B flat? Who knows. 🤷‍♂️

If there are multiple instruments playing during the song, ask to see the conductor’s sheets which has all of the instruments’ playing parts laid out by measures (rhythm segments) throughout the song. You will see what instruments are playing different rhythms at the exact same time in the same place of the song.

If you are practicing a song with an instrument and your peers have different instruments, ask if you can practice with them. This can help identify what their playing parts are and what your playing parts are at the same time. You might be able to identify unique rhythms that will help you realize where you are in the song.

In every band, there is always a rhythmic bass role instrument such as a trombone or drums. They are usually very heavy bass sounds and are usually given parts that set the beats of the song. If there are peers present in your band with a trombone or drums, their parts are usually important for counting. I encourage practicing with them.

This is all I could think off the top of my head but I hope this helps you in some way!

Deaf person here who is also a Teach of the Deaf. You should not have to take this class. Please have your parents meet with your IEP team to find a suitable replacement class.

Disclaimer I am hearing, but I have seen HoH people use this system for paid work 

Synesthesia is a free audio visualizer that I use as a hearing person for community theater sound editing gigs. 

You would just have a laptop with a mic listen for you and each type of sound would show a wave. Then you would ask for the accommodation to have someone highlight what beats you would need to follow. 

Most sound guys who work theater, concerts end up deaf or hoh by time they retire. Its how they often sync background record tracks with live music because they often cant hear the soft sounds so they need the support of the visual sync. 

I hope it helps in someway, or gives you ideas for better accommodations.

Vibrations are your best friend with music! 

Use your hands directly on the speaker.

1mnq12f,deaf,Family who chose only hearing children to adults more in another country than worthless deaf.,"In another country, I raised up in catholic school for only the deaf that no invite hearing students with physical disabilities. This is private more than public school. Nuns in Haiti did welcame Taiwan diplomats to support and fund only deaf drama shows. They ignored the another hearing high schooler with physical disabilities. Hearing children and adults mocked deaf students and people with loser and dumber. Deaf people are slow and disunderstanding in many cases because they got more emotional. 

They would understand their hearing parents not visiting Catholic school for the deaf to church or meeting. Hearing cousins, uncles and aunts could use deafening silence in the world for years before they could be very rage. In addition, parents who loved or cared about physical disabilities more than deaf students and people who are good mind and body working. 

Experiencing before deaf people who surrendered the parents to own in their way. Hearing parents in other country did not help them anyone but deaf people knew how to learn and work from high school for the deaf. Also High school did not support them for new job and no money. That is big crazy.  

Solving in the difficult situation, international deaf adults tried to find new job opportunities with and not ASL interpreter from country to USA. That was not easy.

i got new hearing aids and i am hoping this is just an adjustment phase, but i hate them so far. 

does anyone else with severe-profound (mine is cookie bite so 250hz and 8khz are severe while rest is profound) hearing loss have an issue with their hearing aids where their voice sounds loud but everything else feels impossible to hear? to be fair, my word recognition is awful but i do not qualify for CI due to my right ear only being moderately severe. my voice is just driving me nuts! it is all i can “hear” and its just so loud to me

thankfully my new job is at a school for the Deaf so i will not struggle so much at work, but im just wondering if anyone else has this issue. TIA!! 🤗🤟🏻

Screwed up on unlike hearing family.,"I am international deaf and black man that I was not confident many deaf friends and former students in California. I learned about them in the past. That was bad years through my experiences life. My old deaf and hard hearing friends did not invite or refuse me to hire or work me taking the time. I thought I was not perfect for ASL or not enough learning in sign language to be concepts. Unfortunately, I lost my job because Lyft company suspended me bad reporting from the passenger. One year, I turned to homeless from middle class. 

 I couldn’t blame my late parent from the country not learning French sign language.  My fault was the lack of support myself by teaching and warning hearing parent with oral practicing. Hearing parent did spend a whole of chatting and drinking with family not to focus on me as deaf kid. I did not have a mental illness and problematic behavior. I must accept my own to go and spend myself alone to  many place and learning history. 

In country, I was 12 years old to motivate and listen like observer with many old friend working machine printers, auto repairs, painting arts and making wooden furniture. I learned them what a kind of basic work that I could work like. My mother did not want me to work making cut clothes or making wooden furniture. I was upset that my mom did not knew how to raise me in the poor country. College has not access to deaf adult in the another country. Also, in Los Angeles, I graduated university in BS for business administration and general finance. Too late, my mother suggested me to become a dentist or teacher. My father recommended me to career the engineer.

Out of all the languages; Arabic (the O.G. Language) has the most words: over 12 Million!

So many similar words have one sign. So many words have no sign. S-P-E-L-L it out. Left to Right: Like a typewriter.

 It’s a step-by-step sequence. Everything is in context.

ASL is a visual language. Not only facial cues; but the structure flow. Positioning yourself in different ways to convey.

It was a step-by-step sequence to find ways to adapt. From the beginning, I was born this way. Gathering and building information in blocks.

1mm0tvy,deaf,Flashy  captions,"I’m not on TikTok due to exactly my issues with epilepsy.

Now sometimes those videos crop up on Facebook or friends link me them. Ok.

The problem is that some people use captioning style that triggers my seizures:

Tiny 2-4 words at once, quickly pulsating, also often flashing text or bouncy text karaoke style. This is a major trigger for seizures.

I’m writing this because I want to bring out the awareness. Please don’t caption in this style.

How to do it better:

Longer sentences, longer duration.

No karaoke style

No short duration

No wild colors/fonts

Imagine this: captions shown on tvshows. Minimum 1 second duration. Not shorter!

Basically: boring captions are the best captions. Avoid anything that is “eye catching” aim for plain and boring.


Edit: sorry 
I was meant of post this to 1. Hearies visiting this sub and 2. Deaf people defending this type of captions or tried to play down the issue. So I wanted to add the epilepsy angle as a real and valid reason of not wanting weird captions

Not sure why you’re posting this to the people who already struggle mightily with bad captions. I’m also photosensitive but it’s overwhelmingly hearing people making videos with terrible captions.

You're preaching to the choir, the only thing worse, IMHO, are the videos that only have captions for the first couple of minutes of video then nothing.

no i agree, its why im not on tiktok. its so fucking annoying and its clear theyre just there for the ""aesthetic""

The captions should definitely be longer sentences as it is on tv/streaming. It allows me to quickly read it then watch them speak the words or watch other elements of what's going on in the video. The short one word at a time captions means my eyes have to stay fixated to one spot on the screen.

Yeah I absolutely hate this with a passion. Just do normal damn captions.

I also have photosensitive epilepsy. Have you turned epilepsy safe mode on? Your phone should have a setting somewhere and TikTok also has a setting where it will automatically skip or censor the video with certain flashes/ patterns. Or bring up a warning asking if you want to view it.

Yeah, that's why I avoid TikTok. The captions make me sick

the small percentage of people with photosensitivey epilepsy make for people not consider how actions affect people.

I really, really, really, want to learn BSL, learn about Deaf culture, feel like I have some kind of community (currently I'm floating between not belonging to the hearing world and not belonging to the Deaf community, though I find a lot of common ground with the Deaf content creators I follow.) I want to do all the BSL courses 1-4, but it's extortionate? Thousands of pounds. Is there any funding available that people know of? Or any HoH discount (haha I wish).. but truly. Is there any help with this at all or is this just the shitty world we live in?

[댓글]
I am experiencing this same frustration. I live in London, I've always wanted to learn BSL but been put off by the cost and I thought when I was diagnosed with hearing loss then surely I would qualify for some kind of help... the only course I can see the offers free places gives them to deaf people (makes sense) or hearing people on benefits (why?!!)

No help at all for those of us with hearing loss who would like to learn BSL. And I know from Rose Ayling-Ellis's documentary that parents who have a deaf child are also left to struggle. 

I can't afford to spend thousands of pounds on classes and some of the videos I've seen online are really not helpful for learning with: too small, too quick. And seriously, how do you learn a language in isolation?

&gt;Is there any help with this at all or is this just the shitty world we live in?

Yep...

&gt;Or any HoH discount (haha I wish).. but truly.

Deaf events and groups count I guess, great way to get involved in the community, learn and practice!

&gt; I want to do all the BSL courses 1-4

There are 6 levels. Unless you are in Scotland, which has a slightly different system I don't quite understand...

Check out the limping chicken. It's a deaf new blog based on the UK.
limpingchicken.com

You don't have to do qualifications to learn BSL, the levels are expensive because they're official pieces of paper, there's a lot more to learning a language than having a qualification. Classes are very helpful to get you started (and you can generally find beginner ones pretty cheap) but the real proficiency comes from immersion in the Deaf community, using the language regularly and developing those cultural connections. I learnt BSL through going to Deaf club and developing a friend group of native signers, I never did formal qualifications but I'm very much conversationally fluent, you can do that too!

I did level 1 and 2 through my local adult education a few years ago and I got level 1 free and level 2 reduced due to my deafness so worth checking.",2025-08-09 18:47:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mlwzih/learning_bsl_as_a_hoh_adult/
1mluhki,deaf,"Devices and my ""deaf brain""","I've only had hearing aids for three years but apparently for a lot of my life I didn't hear as well as most people (according to friends who only tell me this just now 😂 - uhhh, thanks, people). I got the HAs when my audiogram said mild-moderate loss, and now it has dropped another 20 decibels to moderate-severe.
I have a love-hate relationship with my devices. They make the world feel much too loud, I still am working hard to understand speech (in a crowd, forget it) and they cause people around me to think I should be able to hear as well as they do. On the other hand, music is clearer, I stream. Audiobooks, and I do understand way more than without them.

My ENT is talking cochlear implants in the next few years because my hearing continues to deteriorate. But...my HAs already generate a lot of questions in my mind. Would I simply be better off deaf? My brain has adjusted and I'm comfortable hearing little. Friends and family are learning ASL with me. Communication will be an issue with others but there are strategies for that. Part of our motivation for learning ASL is so cochlear implants will be a genuine choice when I reach that point, and not something I feel forced to get.

I sense this dissonance (hah...pun not intended but ok) between my deaf brain and the world's expectations, and the gains of technology. The HAs are jarring. I can use then as a tool but boy do I love pretending they don't exist. I'd rather sign, any day. The process of deafening is happening gradually. I feel like my brain is adapting to it and the technology is fighting the adaptation. I constantly feel awkward and misaligned. 
I read a statement from a deaf woman who had abandoned hearing aids, and it keeps coming back to me: ""I can't have a deaf gain if I'm trying so hard not to be deaf."" 

Last summer when my aids broke and I had a loaner pair for 3 weeks I really got a reality check. I didn't like the feeling of being so reliant on them and having had no practice at adapting without them.

Has anyone else kicked around these questions? Thoughts?

[댓글]
I enjoy hearing sounds but I really do prefer being deaf. I rarely wear my hearing aids at all. I have a deaf brain like you said and I’m happier when I’m not hearing anything at all.

&gt; Would I simply be better off deaf?


That is a question many of us in a situation like yours ask, including myself. I lost my left ear pretty quickly (~5 years) but not as quickly with my right ear. When my good ear was getting to a certain point I thought it might actually be easier if I had less hearing and when that time came, I realized I was right. In some way hearing less was a lot easier. I didn't have to strain trying to make sense of sounds. Lip-reading was only a little more difficult but I was building on 20+ years of practice. 


I got implanted in my good ear last November. I'm getting above typical results with it. One thing I was not at all expecting though was the frustration. I had a thought like ""well crap, I spent my whole adult life learning how to be alive while deaf, now I need to work at being alive being a cyborg"". (With a CI I'm still deaf but I'm hearing more than I have in 25 years). It was like a dunk in cold water. 


Bottom line, your thoughts are valid and not uncommon. I like to recommend to any person considering a CI to first be completely comfortable in their own skin as a deaf person.

Im struggling so much with learning sign, but I think I would be more comfortable switching off the hearing world. Ive been inbetween my whole life, and feel a part of neither hearing society nor Deaf culture.

I only have mild loss now but if mine progresses I feel the same way about CIs. For me it’s more about my other medical history and not wanting to risk the surgery, but I have a Deaf friend who doesn’t use aids and she gets along fine so I think I’d be able to adapt. I also prefer not to wear my aids unless I have to (work/crowded situations) bc sounds annoy me a lot more now too.

Your reasoning makes perfect sense. It’s a strange world!

Nonetheless, in my country most go for both CI and signing. I guess it should be the reasonable choice. There are so many hearing people who don’t sign, and even your family won’t be fully fluent. Especially when we move out and don’t have contact with parents and siblings every day. There are just so many things that become easier if you have hearing enough to cope at least in quiet environments.  Don’t between worlds is a pain, but many things might be a bit easier too. Rejecting any communication seems not ideal.

Obviously, I totally see you point. It has to be a personal decision. Where I live there are plenty of CI users who also participate in the Deaf world. It’s more about wether you sign well and want to be part of the culture. You’re definitely deaf as soon as you remove the CI or technology fails.

Welcome to the universal deaf experience 🤷🏼‍♂️ Nobody likes sound or being reliant on devices, and our brains are literally not set up to be auditory-focussed the way hearing people's are. Unfortunately we live in a world where you're forced to use sound to do most jobs/hobbies/social activities etc. If you can get enough of an ASL-using community and it's compatible with where you wanna go in terms of career and activities just enjoy being deaf, I wish I could tbh!

Thanks everyone. Sometimes the ""in between"" feeling is just more than I can take. It helps a lot to find that I'm not the only one who feels a little stuck in the middle. I'm not crazy. 🥴",2025-08-09 17:03:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mluhki/devices_and_my_deaf_brain/

Most hearing people don’t know about new experience with deaf people in the past so maybe hearing parents or grandparents refused to invite their new deaf friends. 

Hearing people or workers tried to test and close to scream deaf person that they tried to speak him to be more frustrated.

This was betrayal making old friends and big family to avoid from me to be worthless and lifeless as homeless in the shelter currently. 

I put gofundme about $600 on the internet by noticing old hearing and deaf friends, workers and relatives on instagram, Snapchat, facebook, WhatsApp and more. They got not enough $200 in gofundme but deaf person got upset. Deaf adult couldn’t complain to beg when many people didn’t love each other about good heart human. His parents gave small money to homeless when the deaf boy saw and learned from them with good heart. Many hearing parents ruined their deaf children grew no good heart human with no teaching and experiencing. 

Another problem, deaf adult was worthless in the circle old hard hearing friends got smart and rich by strictly hearing parents. Hard hearing people were not helping deaf people. Deaf adult was taught deaf people to avoid hard hearing with more comfortable hearing people in many events and bars easily. For example, hard hearing people many community colleges and universities refused to see deaf students and got motivated to 5 classes ending. Some deaf students had 4 classes to end to work full time that  got stressful. Without family and friends, deaf adults figured out them better.

They went to a doctor and he suggested a surgery..any idea pls? The kid is 100% deaf by both the ears . however doctors said that the surgery will make him able to listen 

They met a kid's parents they had the same story and now the kid can hear and talk

I want to know if there are any alternate treatments? Or if the kid can just use the machine (the one like an earplug/earphone)

Thanks alot

The surgery they're talking about is probably the cochlear implant. If the child is truly 100% deaf (rare that this is true, more likely it is ""severe to profound"") In that case hearing aids are less likely to be helpful. I do have severe to profound hearing loss and use hearing aids though.  

The big thing is that just because they have cochlear implants doesn't mean the child will be totally fixed.  ""Hear and talk"" doesn't mean all that much, and it doesn't mean that THIS child will have the same results.  

There's nothing inherently wrong with cochlear implants if the child gets a well-rounded education in what that means and has a good support system - and ideally access to their local sign language too.

It is not too late to learn a language. This is a great time to pick up a language for your kid before they reach 5 years old. That's why we have sign language as a legitimate language. There are facts, details that we are happy to share with you. I do understand the Doctor's point of view on health terms. Their first impression is to get it ""fixed"" as in an easy and fast method. That part is true, I wanted to add to that, those doctors don't check in or follow with a deaf specialist with the right resources and knowledge can give the best tools and navigate through life.  Doctors should be more inclusive in giving you more options. To support Sevendaysky, I do agree with the idea of starting with hearing aids and getting confirmation on the audiogram. For example, [Audiogram example](https://www.wsiassn.org/media/images/SoundExamples.width-800.jpg) 

Today, technology is so advanced that you can check it out. Please consider Cochlear implants as a last resort. Cochlear implants (CI) are NOT designed for lifetime or longevity. Once CI gets upgraded, they will have to go through another surgery.  Again, do not hesitate to reach out to us.

You need to check around India, there are deaf people in India and they will have organizations.  

Here is one. https://vaani.in/

I mean cochlear implants will allow the kid to hear, I’d say “will make him able to listen” is debatable. The kid has missed out on 2 years of language skills and even if they hadn’t I’d argue a lot of toddlers don’t listen even if they hear you.

No matter what you do, make sure the child learns ASL

Keep one thing in mind,  cochlear implants are not a ""fix"" nor do they restore hearing fully.  Results can vary widely but the one common thread for ""success"" is if the parents have high expectations for their child's success, and the time to invest in their child's hearing and speech therapy for several years.  As for sign language, the excuse that ""no one knows it"" or ""the parents don't know"" it is not a valid argument. The family can learn right along with the child. Seek out local deaf education programs for support. I highly recommend a reading a copy of ""Silent Garden: A Parent's Guide to Raising Your Deaf Child"" [https://gupress.gallaudet.edu/Books/T/The-Silent-Garden](https://gupress.gallaudet.edu/Books/T/The-Silent-Garden)

Please make the parents learn the India sign language.

My son was diagnosed as profoundly deaf at 3 years old, he use to speak and hear. Our dr made note that my son is a candidate for the cochlear implant but made it clear, this is a 50/50 shot of him hearing. We did the surgery at age 4 and then 5. He’s 12 now, and our dr had also let us know then that he will be sign dependent even with the surgery. At this age he is a fantastic signer and is still working on speech. He’s thriving. You can also DM me if you have any questions 🤟🏼

Unbelievable, hearing family tried to mock a young international deaf boy was alone and fed up in the circled house. They don’t want him to hangout deaf boys or girls. Thinking deaf adults taught deaf international boys got successful on the way of the hearing family. 

That was ridiculous. deaf boy got not interested in deaf boys got immature and underdeveloped from middle school to high school when international deaf boy with strict Catholic school moved bad new school in USA.

1ml0lqn,deaf,Bad discrimination in USA,"I learned many situations that many deaf and hearing teachers USA had educated me to practice and learn deaf culture and high school for the deaf. He got a degree from university with BS and struggling in English unlike American Sign Language. I appreciate it when many teachers forced me no give up everyday importantly. 

A deaf teacher told me that not word using “deaf” put on the application job by not hiring many companies and hearing workers.  For example, deaf person got hired at Vons and Vons was basic training to teach him to learn and observe fast with the ASL interpreter for 2 days. Deaf was alone to communicate with phone typing to the mangers who tried to hid from him helping. He experienced working at Vons for 9 years when they did never teach him to promote and fed up. So he got stuck to search jobs when he already quit the job. Many companies knew their Deaf problem that deaf workers were slow, disunderstanding and not paying attention in an areas with many workers. Many workers took the advantage of more hours and money talking and laughing with managers easily. Deaf workers were not fair and inferior under many mangers. 

Hearing people in events and club parties avoided and were scare of one deaf person without other deaf people when they noticed or didn’t want to talk them in anywhere. Deaf person wanted to be independent traveling and experiencing more when he own on my way without his big family not knowing about deaf culture. In addition, deaf person went bar cigar himself talking bartender to have difficulty communicating and telling gossip on him “Deaf” as mute. Understandingly, deaf person took time enjoying, smoking and drinking when it didn’t mean lonely. Hearing People in bar communicate each other about more job and life experiences, promoting the important idea and new companies. Deaf person got not encouraged by hearing people. Deaf person got the right to learn myself a lot working and expressing to them ignoring when he got enough time. 

Deaf person got educated and knowledgeable that many deaf people are struggling in the education. Parents don’t care to thrown their kids to kindergarten to high school when they can’t afford to focus on them in the important Deaf education in USA more than other countries have the lacking education and resources, Haiti, India and more.

I am a hearing parent of a deaf child. He is about 18 months old, and has had hearing aids since 9 months of age. My partner and I are working to learn ASL. We have weekly video-conference speech therapy sessions and in-home ASL lessons led by a deaf woman who comes to our home. I joined this subreddit to observe and get a feel for deaf culture, as well as to learn what to expect as my son grows up and do my best to help him navigate this world.

I am so sorry, but I have a very hard time understanding what you are trying to say here. This is not simply me failing to relate, since I am hearing and have only very mild deficits in comprehension now that I am older. Your grammar and syntax are hard for me to follow. I want to understand you better, and I can tell you are trying very hard to be understood. It breaks my heart to think my son may some day struggle to be ""heard"" (if you all will forgive my use of that euphemism here) like this. 

Thanks to our sign language lessons, I am starting to identify differences in spoken/written English and ASL. Being mindful of these differences has helped me to understand your post a little more, but I still don't get the overall point. Is there someone you know who can help you express this more clearly? Or if the failing is mine, is there someone here who can summarize this for a father who wants to know how to help his son, and learn to understand deaf people, even in their writing?",2025-08-08 16:56:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ml0lqn/bad_discrimination_in_usa/

1mkqi0c,deaf,Is it Bad to pretend I can’t hear men that flirt with me in public?,"I’m hard of hearing, but not fully deaf. I’m bilingual and speak English and sign ASL. I get a lot of creeps trying to hit on me in public spaces, and sometimes I pretend to not hear them. If they stand near me and look at me for a prolonged amount of time after I act like I don’t hear them, I sign to them that I’m deaf. Is this evil?

[댓글]
How would this be evil?


The only thing is that it might put you in danger with men who might think you are very vulnerable.

I do the exact same thing lol, and I don't feel the slightest bit bad about it. it really doesn't matter that I'm 'lying' about being fully deaf when I don't know these dudes and in a few seconds they'll be out of sight and out of mind. Don't let the opinions of strangers bother you

Like others have said this isn’t evil, and I don’t really have problem with the intentions, especially since you’re hoh and not intentionally being disrespectful.

But pretending to be deaf or more deaf won’t always make someone leave you alone, I wish more people talked about this when mentioning this topic.

If they’ve already targeted you, your hearing level doesn’t matter, no matter how careful you are. In bad people’s eyes, we’re easy targets to isolate, exploit, or hurt.

In these situations, you’re directly telling to someone you already see as dangerous or unwanted that you’re not fully aware or vulnerable.

It’s not some trick up your sleeve or easy out, and I know this from experience of being Deaf in bars/clubs/sketchy places. 

To stay safe, I mention it at the front, signal to the bartender, and stay aware. If I’m alone, then I’m pretending to be hearing.

My hearing friends have also had extremely bad experiences while doing this, some even having to involve police.

The danger comes from their perception, how some people see and treat deaf people, not from being deaf itself. I’d first suggest actual safety precautions like apps, friends, or alarms before exaggerating your deafness.

I’m kinda glad to find out that I’m not the only one who’s ever done this…but I’ve also pretended that I could hear people and just agreed to be polite so I guess I play it both ways lol

You could become a bigger target. People with disabilities are a much higher rate of being assaulted. 39% of rape victims had a disability of some sort.

I did this once, but for a different reason than you. It was to ignore a Karen yelling at me in front of my house. Background to Karen was one of my relatives dogs my family was pet sitting for escaped and Karen saw one of my family members catch the dog before they ran onto a busy street. Which somehow made her very upset and proceeded to yell at them, unaware of the events that transpired. When they wouldn’t give her the time of day, she must have drove around looking for our house and spotted me. At the time I was trying to get my dog into house when she starts yelling at me from behind. So I proceeded to act like I didn’t hear her and brought my dog into the house. It was the one time I used the trick and it worked. All I had to do was remember times I couldn’t hear from behind and acted the same way. Not bad at all. I would be careful tho, there were times I genuinely couldn’t hear and people would tap or come close me to get my attention so just be aware it doesn’t always work out like you think.

People who haven't got a hearing impairment ignore creepy fucks all the time and it's absolutely okay for them to do at least that. You're fine

I do this with anybody I don’t want to talk with in public tbh. It’s one of the perks of being Deaf/HoH.

Nope that ur secrets weapon to protect urself we all done that

No, and I am unapologetic about doing precisely that with salespeople.

Your results may vary.. It didn’t work on my husband. Instead he found it interesting and made a point to come over and talk to me.  35 years later I haven’t managed to get rid of him following me around.

In alls seriousness it won’t stop people who are actually creepy, it will make you a larger target, they may get angry and assume you are pretending, as a lot of people do and that puts actual deaf people at risk. 

It also has the slight audist tint where if you are deaf you aren’t worth the time to try to communicate with, which I don’t love, but again if we are talking about truly creepy guys they probably won’t put in the effort anyway.

How tf is it evil? 😭 men who catcalls are evil asf!

I wouldn't call avoidance as being bad... It's unsolicited by them.

Hearing women do the same thing with headphones ignoring them.

I suspect however , pretending not to be dead might make them try harder based on stereotypes of deaf people.

Pretending not to hear? You can also pretend to not see them and brush them out of your way. You can do this with a scowl or glare to your preference. Unsolicited flirting need not be tolerated, and you can express that any way you choose. As others have stated, though, please make sure you are being safe.

No. Maybe rude, but not evil lol 

I have some hearing in one of my ears and when I can hear somebody that I really don’t want to interact with, I often intentionally ignore them and pretend I heard nothing 😭 although that’s usually salespeople and stuff like that ope 

I usually DON’T hear them though, thankfully lol

Lmao no, as you should tbh

i pretend not to hear a lot of people. i get a lot of stares and negative attention from people so i usually pretend not to hear at all. it's not evil or bad!

its weird for me though because i stg its easier for me to hear someone making a negative comment about me than it is for me to hear someone actually wanting to talk to me

I never considered catcalls flirting. It’s meant to be heard by the woman and make her uncomfortable. Most men also tend to do it in groups-pack mentality.  One guy catcalling is rarer but that lone guy is most certainly a chauvinistic jerk-off.  I will say they may legitimately find the woman attractive-but it’s such a boorish way to express it.  And sadly? They do it to unattractive females as well ….and that just plain cruel. 😔

Nope, sometimes it's easier to have that advantage. dont feel bad for it, I got out of a broken tail light ticket for claiming to be fully deaf, im 90% deaf.

Honey I’m hearing and act like I can’t hear men trying to hit on me in public

I'm literally hearing and if i don't want to talk to a man i act like he fully doesn't exist

When I was hearing I ignored people like this, well I didn't pretend I was deaf, I just ignored what they were saying completely though as it's gross and there is nothing to be gained by giving them any attention at all. So I can't see how this is rude.

A lot of the comments here confuse me. Isn’t this a forum for the deaf? Pretending to be deaf, or to have any disability, for perceived social advantages is not okay and is disrespectful to those who aren’t pretending.

Why do you call them creeps when it's normal that people flirt with each other.  
Just because some (or most) that flirt with you are physically not your type doesn't make them creeps.  
That's just a weird thing to say...

I don't hear a thing, but if I see someone flirt with me that physically doesn't attract me then I simply look away and don't look at that person again.  
I think it's the same as pretending not to hear them.  
So no, it's not evil at all.  
It's simply telling people that you are not interested, which they should accept and move on.

I have this problem. I just wish I wasn’t so god damn pretty.

How much hearing loss do I have to have between identifying as hard of hearing vs deaf? Currently I have moderate hearing loss which is in relatively steep decline. I had no hearing loss two years ago. I have been learning ASL and I have hearing aids and an FM mic.

Thank you for any help or advice.

[댓글]
&gt; How much hearing loss do I have to have between identifying as hard of hearing vs deaf?

That's mostly a YOU question: when do *you* feel deaf? You said ""moderate hearing loss which is in relatively steep decline"" which means you probably identify as Hard of Hearing? That's totally fine.

Generally I recommend people out themselves based on how the outing process generally works out to random people, for instance:

If you out yourself as HH, people generally assume you can understand speech still. They might speak louder or slow down their speech(neither of which is likely to help, especially if you have hearing aids).

If you out yourself as deaf, people will (hopefully) assume you can't hear speech anymore and will adjust accordingly. They might assume you lipread at 100% accuracy, which nobody does, but what can you do. *shrugs*

To people that are in your life daily, you can get into nuances and explain the details, as you wish.

To the deaf/HH community, they probably understand your hearing nuances a LOT better and you can be much more detailed in your outing if you choose.

I lipread OK, but I *ALWAYS*,  without exception, tell people I don't lipread at all when I'm first coming out to them. This generally forces them to think a bit more and hopefully move to a medium of communication where we are roughly equal (usually written english).

You’re hard of hearing by the technical definition of the word (moderate hearing loss). 

Anything beyond that is a question of identity and culture.

KISS (Keeping it stupidly simple) answer …

Any loss = you’re one of us. Welcome aboard.

I see HH, not deaf, but possibly identify as Deaf in future.

Short answer - use whichever term you prefer. HoH and deaf aren't medical terms or tied to any specific level of hearing loss, HoH GENERALLY means someone has a milder loss and deaf means they have a more severe one but where the line is between 'milder' and 'more severe' is very subjective, and I know plenty of people at both ends of the scale who use the opposite term. There's also a growing pride movement among oral deaf &amp; bilingual people and disability justice communities that uses deaf as a catch-all term for anyone with hearing loss (often people at the milder end will describe themselves as mildly/moderately/partially deaf rather than HoH).

The real difference is in people's perception - most people expect someone who describes themself as HoH to function in the 'hearing way' (ie using speech, being able to do things like make phone calls etc) just with a few issues or by using a hearing device, whereas they expect someone who describes themself as deaf to have different communication needs from a hearing person (ie bad or limited speech, reliance on lipreading, using assistive tech like captioning, textphones etc). Obviously this isn't really related to your hearing level on an audiogram - you can be completely deaf but have CIs that work well enough you don't need many extra adjustments, or late-deafened and have perfect speech despite having pretty major hearing loss, or you can have a minor hearing loss but really struggle with 'normal' communication if you have APD, don't have access to hearing devices, have other disabilities that affect it etc. 

There are pros and cons to both terms - calling yourself HoH gets less negative assumptions but often means you won't be given any adjustments because you're considered 'basically a hearing person', calling yourself deaf makes sure you get adjustments but will usually get you stereotyped or excluded from things because people assume you can't communicate in the 'normal' way at all. It's also fine to use them interchangeably - I identify as deaf but only ever call myself HoH at work because I need to make the point my hearing issues are minimal and don't affect my ability to do my job, I know people who identify as HoH but call themselves deaf in specific situations to make the point that they need adjustments.

Obviously both of these are different from (big-D) Deaf, which refers specifically to the Deaf community and requires using sign as your main/preferred/only language and being involved in Deaf culture (which has nothing to do with your level of hearing loss, there are plenty of people with mild losses who are culturally Deaf) - don't use the term Deaf unless you're part of the culture, but otherwise describe yourself however you like

I am always thinking about this question! I've realised when I tell hearing people I have a hearing loss/ am hard of hearing, they... don't believe me?? They laugh, or say they also can't hear, say 'me too' or will be surprised at my hearing aids and exclaim they didn't realise I was ACTUALLY.. ya know... So for me, I tell hearing people I'm partially deaf, hoping they hear the word 'deaf' and actually believe me.

1mkh2pg,deaf,Does anyone have a bone anchored hearing aid implant with sensineural hearing loss?,"My research on the devices I’m most interested in and the research I’ve done suggests a bone anchored hearing aid might be a good solution for me (profound sensineural hearing loss causing SSD as of a year ago).  Even my insurance criteria says I’d qualify for one with that type of hearing loss.

However my audiologist was adjusting my hearing aid (which does nothing for me) and I mentioned it and she said it wouldn’t be an option because it doesn’t treat sensineural hearing loss?!?  She said I’d need a cochlear but I would not qualify because I can hear too well on my other side.

I don’t understand why I’m getting two different answers here.   So basically I can’t even get a referral because she says I’m not a candidate?

[댓글]
If you have single-sided deafness, with normal hearing in the opposite ear, you would be a candidate. 
Unfortunately, not every medical professional knows the criteria for every device, especially if they don’t work with them. 
I recommend you get a copy of your most recent audiogram and see an otologist who performs bone-anchored surgeries.

So there are bone anchored hearing devices that bypass a bad middle ear, say if the  the ossicles (tiny middle ear bones) have been damaged, as long as the inner ear is still OK.  That kind of device would send vibrations directly to the inner ear of your bad ear,  and you'd be expected to be able to hear again in the bad ear.  

But there are other bone-anchored devices that send vibrations from the bad side across to the good ear.  That will work for someone with SNHL.  You don't get any hearing in the bad ear, but you get awareness of sounds occurring over on your bad side in your good ear.  

I hope that makes sense, I feel like I didn't word it well.

I'd be leaving this audiologist if I were you.  They should know this.

Also, Medicare criteria for a CI for single-sided hearing loss take into account only the bad ear.  No mention of the good ear at all in their criteria.  Private insurance does not have to follow Medicare but often does.  I don't know who your payor is, but something to keep in mind.  Your audiologist may be talking about your specific payor's criteria, since the payors are essentially the ones who create the criteria.

Yeah, I have an Osia - which is a type of BAHA.

Basically, it fills in sounds in the dead zone / head shadow.

Before, if someone was talking to me on my bad side, I might be able to tell their talking, but I wouldn't understand any of the words.

Now the hearing aid picks it up, and sends it to my good ear. 

So I couldn't hold a convo unless you were in front of me or on my good side. And now I can hear and understand things on my bad side and even from behind.

It's not perfect. It's not stereo hearing. It doesn't really help with loud environments. 

But it's a big improvement in general. A lot better in vehicles and restaurants that were almost impossible before. 

It's basically doing the same thing as a CROS system, but it's surgically implanted. And an implant is higher fidelity. (If it wasn't, the BAHA wouldn't be an option)

I have sensorineural hearing loss, and I am currently trialling a BAHA. It does depend on the type of hearing loss as to whether it would work for you- I’m finding it pretty good right now.

I’m interested in this as I also have snhl ssd as of a year ago. I’m on an nhs waiting list to trial the bone anchored hearing aid.

A BAHA for sensorineural loss? No, because that's not how it works.",2025-08-08 00:39:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mkh2pg/does_anyone_have_a_bone_anchored_hearing_aid/
1mk4kvv,deaf,ASL and Auslang,"I've heard deaf Australians and deaf Americans use different sign languages. How do they communicate with each other?

[댓글]
I've heard hearing Americans and hearing Austrians use different spoken languages.  How do they communicate with each other?  

Why isn't there one global language? It would make things like hearing education so much easier.  I don't speak any English but I'm happy to volunteer to design a new standardised spoken language for hearing children. It will help to reduce the global shortage of teachers of hearing children. 

We can start by eliminating any spoken words that sound like each other. These words are confusing for us adults.  Spoken grammar should of course follow signed grammar, with topic then comment.  Of course some regional dialects and nuances will be lost, but that is OK, standardisation is important for education.  We will use short simple words that are easy to pronounce. 

We could call this language NewSpeak.

They write in English, like we’re doing right now.

typically, when someone knows a sign language (any sign language), they're usually better at using gestures to communicate with others. i know ASL, but not Auslan, and i've still been able to successfully communicate with non-ASL signers because sign languages are visual and expressive.

since there are so many different sign languages around the world, deaf people often rely on a set of informal, commonly understood gestures called ""international sign"" (sometimes referred to as universal sign language) at international deaf events like the deaflympics or global conferences.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U\_Q7axl4oXY&amp;t=535s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Q7axl4oXY&amp;t=535s)

Nyle Dimarco did a Ted Talk a while ago explaining how he travels the world as a Deaf man, and how he had a better time understanding people who speak other languages than hearing people.

Australians use Auslan, not Auslang. Auslang is part of Auslan, but it is not the name of the sign language used.

It is common for people who can sign to be able to pick up other sign languages pretty quickly, as they are used to not being understood a lot of the time. Or they learn it just like you would any new language.

I am a hearing 23F and have had a crush (24M) for 3 years who is profoundly deaf. (He can hear well with his cochlear implant) He’s came across as a quiet individual that is not as confident and would isolate himself all the time.  

He’s been emotionally avoidant and didn’t wanna be in a relationship even after I confessed my feelings to him. Part of it I believe was being overly independent and emotionally withdrawn having bad experiences with people towards him being deaf. 

Just wanna see what the general views are on whether it’s worth it to try to reconnect with him showing him that I’ve been trying to understand this part of his world.

1mjfoms,deaf,"I was mentally prepared for slow hearing loss, not waking up to silence","My story starts in 2020 when I suddenly lost hearing in my right ear. I went to the ENT thinking it was earwax or something simple. I did CT scan and was diagnosed with otosclerosis (no family history) in both ears, but one was worse than the other. I was fitted with hearing aids.

Over time, my left ear, which had always been the stronger one, also started to decline. Two years ago, I was told the loss had become sensorineural, not conductive anymore, based on my audiometry results. I was told that the hearing loss in both ears would be slow and progressive. 

Two days ago, I woke up and couldn’t hear out of my left ear (the comparatively good ear). What little I can hear sounds robotic and muffled. I rushed to the ER and asked for a steroid shot, just to be safe, but nothing was done. I went to another hospital and it was the same experience.

Eventually, I found an ENT who actually took me seriously. He gave me a steroid injection (dexamethasone) and told me to get an MRI to see what’s really going on.

I’m going back tomorrow for a hearing test and possibly more steroid shots.

I’m scared. I had mentally prepared myself for a slow hearing decline, not something this sudden. I’ve relied on my left ear for the past few years, The only ear I used to hear on the phone. Now I can barely hear from it. 

stapedectomy might help my right ear, but nothing is guaranteed.

I’m confused, frustrated, hurting, and I don’t know what the future holds for me. There’s no hard of hearing or deaf community where I live, and even though my family has been supportive, I still feel incredibly alone.

1micj0r,deaf,(48F-hearing) married to my Deaf husband (52M) — How our relationship reshaped how I understand communication &amp; connection.,"Hi everyone! I (48F, hearing) am married to my husband (52M, Deaf), and I wanted to share a little of our story—and also hear from others in Deaf/hearing relationships about their experiences.

We met 7 years ago through Bumble. At the time, I was a single mom stepping into online dating for the first time. He had been using dating apps for years, but had faced frustrating experiences—matches ghosting after realizing he was Deaf, women leaving first dates early, etc. Eventually, he stopped listing “Deaf” in his bio—not because he was hiding it, but because he wanted to be seen as a whole person first.

When we met in person, communication was a blend of lipreading, speaking, gesturing, and typing things out on the fly. It wasn’t always “smooth,” but what stood out was how present he was in every moment. That pace of connection felt different than anything I’d experienced in previous relationships.

Now, after 4 years of marriage, blending families, and a lot of navigating, I can say that being in a Deaf/hearing relationship has completely reshaped the way I understand communication. It’s not about “perfect clarity” or always having the right words—it’s about patience, presence, and respect.

I’m still learning. I’m learning ASL (admittedly slower than I wish), and we navigate through moments of miscommunication with a lot of humor and curiosity.

I’d love to hear from others in Deaf/hearing relationships—what’s been challenging? What’s been rewarding? What would you want hearing partners (or potential partners) to better understand?

If you’re curious about our full story, I shared more here:

Thanks for letting me share, and I’d love to listen and learn from your experiences too. 💛

I’m not sure how culturally intertwined your husband is… I come from a failed Deaf/Hearing marriage (I’m Deaf, ex is hearing) and currently in a Deaf/Deaf marriage. The biggest thing that split my ex and me up was that I found my Deaf identity (big D) and found “my people” which made me happy. I found where I belonged and she felt like she couldn’t fit in and was left out.  The biggest challenge for you would be to stay flexible, continue learning ASL, and be part of his world while including him in your world. As the hearing “liaison” in the relationship… I hate to say this but the burden of ensuring your husband is included is on you. You will have to interpret for him around the dinner table when he is lost or confused.
I’m not saying it can’t be done. I’m just saying it’s not easy… but it can be done.

I met my husband in high school. I was mainstreamed because my dad was in the Army and there were no programs for kids like me on the Army bases where we lived (and we moved every few years). I asked my husband recently if my deafness had any bearing on our relationship and he said he never thought about it. We were friends for about a year before we started actually dating, so maybe that's why it was never a factor for him. (ETA: I'm 55 and he's 58)

She went to a rival high school, her parents live 20 minutes away, etc.  I didn't mention my deafness at first, namely because I didn't think about it and I tend to be a bit shy in mentioning that when I was dating.   It turned out she loves helping and spending time with autistic children, worked with deaf people, that kind of thing.  She was kind of disappointed that I didn't know sign language.  She's encouraging me to learn it so we can communicate privately in public settings and for when I don't have my implant on.   How are you learning it?

My only idea has been meditation, listing flowers or fish alphabetically, building tiny homes in my imagination. Silly really but any ideas?","

[댓글]
I read something a while ago, and I’ve tried it a few times with some success. You just slowly list random words. Bear. Juniper. Red. Food. Dakota. Rainbow. Circuit. Dresser. One every 5 seconds or so, so it’s easy. Stuff with no relationship, so that you’re not distracted by it, but it also occupies your brain so it doesn’t wander onto other things.  

The article went more into the science of it… something about how your sleeping brain works in a similar way, with random disparate ideas, so it eases you into sleep, but I don’t remember. I just know it’s better than thinking about whatever I am anxious about.  
  
I should mention that I’m hearing—I’m in this sub because learning ASL is a hobby—but I don’t think the technique I mentioned would be affected by deafness?

I just read something, a book, or on the phone until I fell asleep. Sometimes, I can't sleep at all, I will light up a joint.

Edited: I used to count numbers in my head. If I lose count, I will start over until I drift off. Or ABCs. I stopped because I found another way to fall asleep

I read book and also sometimes meditate. It helps me clear my mind before I sleep and then I get better sleep.

I have a loud white noise machine that helps drown out (level out?) my severe tinnitus. Otherwise, I'd be awake, listening to the hissing/buzzing. (I'm deaf in one ear since birth and hard of hearing in the other).

I use aftershocks a lot and I like cello music really bassy stuff makes me relax. But most of my hearing loss high frequency anyway

I doomscroll. It's silly in a bad way.

I have some pillow mists that are meant to be relaxing, and the scents do help.  I also have a vibrating stuffed animal that's technically meant for children I guess, but it's soothing.  Sometimes when I'm really struggling I'll ingest something herbal, if you catch my drift.  Mostly it's about developing good sleep hygiene though and sticking to a routine.  Using the bed for sleep only.  Following similar patterns every night so my body knows when it's time to wind down.

To fall asleep,.I take a warm shower and read a book after. Sometimes I will also.take melatonin if I'm not too tired. 


We also have a bed with a massage setting and the vibrations are really peaceful.

I just shut my eyes and fall asleep.

I struggle to fall asleep as well. Bc of my phone. I've taken to having a red screen filter on. And turning my bedroom lights to red. Seems to help calm down a bit if nothing else 

I like to watch ASMR from time to time. Visual ASMR like makeup or flashlights or brushing hair. ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

I take off my hearing aids and the world goes silent, but that obviously doesn’t work if you don’t wear hearing aids

Can’t see? Do you have vision impairment also?

Edibles help me sleep

I just roll over, get comfy and close eyes. Asleep in like 5 minutes. Even before having a routine before bed I didn't have issues in falling asleep.


However, after starting the routine, I felt a a pretty good difference in sleep quality. [This video outlines most of the routine](https://youtu.be/LPTo8L4fec0?si=2VLDLJ4dNxANhpAM).


You can also look up sleep hygiene.

Either just lay down and close my eyes, or sometimes read a few chapters in whatever book I'm currently on.

Not deaf but I struggle to fall asleep. Progressive Muscle Relaxation works for me. Basically it’s engaging each muscle group while lying in bed starting from your head to toes. For example, squeeze your eyes shut as tight as you can, scrunch your nose, puff out your cheeks, make fists and squeeze as hard as you can, etc. The idea is to release physical tension to relax your body and eventually your mind

Don't rule out that there might be an addressable medical issue that hurts your sleep mood.  When I had unregulated high blood pressure I felt almost on the verge of a headache and my mind would race all night.  That said, they call high BP the silent killer because there are usually no symptoms.

Don't drink caffeine, and just focus on relaxing your body from the face down.

Melatonin?

Wow. I thought I was the only one who recites words silently when trying to fall asleep. I pick a random topic, like cities, famous people, trees, etc. and do it alphabetically. I usually can’t get to Z as I’ve fallen asleep already. (If I hadn’t, I start over until I do.)

I was also born similar, I was born Deaf and later developed Ménière’s, and have poor vestibular function. I was only diagnosed with Ménière’s 4-5 years ago though.

I have SCDS Semicircular Canal Dehision Syndrome.  My temporal bone is thin and holes in several spots where my semicircular canals stick out of temporal bone. Explains my complete lack of balance but dr said it doesn't affect my hearing? I do wonder if the Intracranial Hypertension i suffer affects my ears at all, dr said the pressure may have thinned out my temporal bones. Holy smokes!

i also have meniere's and vestibular issues. I'm sorry. It sucks.

I’m deaf because there was a congenital issue with my vestibular aqueducts and the fluid leaked out and destroyed my hair cells. I’m in my early 20s but I have the balance of a 60 year old, and I’ve never gotten dizzy in my life (in fact, I suspect I *can’t* get dizzy due to the vestibular issues)

I have some sort of vestibular issue but undiagnosed so far. My doctors suspect Ménière’s but we haven’t gotten diagnosis yet.

I was born deaf and definitely have balance issues in general. Never been able to safely ride a bike on actual roads, very much wish I had a walk in shower instead of a tub, etc. I'm quite good at catching myself but am never really actually balanced. 

I don't have menieres and just kinda assume it's because the vestibular system is also the cochlea so if that's damaged the vestibular system probably is too.",2025-08-04 22:20:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mhroav/how_many_of_you_deafhohdeaf_also_have_vestibular/

I guess the speed date went well! I'd love to know more about your thoughts because I am really trying to spend more time at events like this. It is really nice to know I would be welcome and find people interested.

When absolutely necessary I use lapel mic to phone. 

I prefer not and see person face talk with. 

Best option is ask her.

Constant reading also can cause fatigue for communication.

Lapel mic only make communication easier you possibly not her.

She continue must read.

Next date try great light, shave if not shave now, remain open writing, and good luck!

If they sign, learn at least a few signs. Please. It matters.

Why not learn asl? It’s a key to our soul. I’m 50 years old. I divorced my 1st wife cuz she didn’t learn ASL like she said she would. She had 8 years. I had 45 years in speaking English which is not my native language.

I’d bring up the idea you have to her and see if that’d actually be helpful. If she can’t hear anything at all a microphone isn’t really going to do anything, so I think you’d have better luck having a conversation about it with her to see what will work best for the both of you.

1mhfms0,deaf,Removing wax(?) on eardrum at home?,"Context: I already get my ears vacuumed out 2x/year at the ENT. My hearing aids (Phonak Audeo, I think) make my ear canals itchy, so my ENT prescribed DermOtic oil, which helps a lot. But I find sometimes it seems to coat my eardrum and/or maybe the oil dissolves some of the wax and then that “melts” onto my eardrum? Not really sure what’s happening in there, but the upshot is, I’m not hearing well out of one ear. I’m pretty sure there isn’t an infection or anything. From past experience, I think it’s just something stuck on the eardrum. Any ideas for getting rid of it before I give up and pay the ENT to vacuum out my ear? I’ve already tried warm water. I obviously don’t want to scrape around in there. My understanding is that Debrox really only works for softening wax to help it get flushed out via bathing. Anyone know if it would help?


Any other ideas? TIA! 

[댓글]
There once you soften the wax with Debrox,  fill
one of those baby syringes with warm water and gently keep squirt ling onto side of ear while tilting ear downward  ( this is how a nurse cleared out wax from
my ear)

There isn't really much to do at home without risking perfurating the eardrum.


The issue is that the eardrum is pretty deep and the self cleaning mechanism our ears have doesn't cover the whole ear canal up until the eardrum. So even if you manage to dissolve it, there isn't any mechanism acting to naturally clean it out.

I use something called Elephant Ear Washer.  It comes in a spray bottle.  Never had an issue with it in the years that I've had it.  As far as my ears go, best money I ever spent.

Professional ear cleaning costs $15-$35 feels like a new pair of sneakers and totally affordable and worth it

If you're in the US, and the college is not a private college, go to their disability services webpage. Some colleges have an application you need to fill out, others will require an appointment for you to meet with a specialist. 

Are there any other accommodations you might use? Preferred seating? CART? Instructor notes? Early registration so you can choose instructors you know you can learn from better? Are you stying in the dorms? It's better to ask for EVERYTHING you might possibly need, then reject what you don't need later on.

If you have an audiogram/documentation from a doctor, or an IEP from K-12, that can be helpful (though they will not always accept it).

The message is fine. Is there a disability office/student support team you're sending it to?

I had a college notetaker 30 years ago. It was a student in my class with good grades and readable handwriting and I had to find them myself - not an easy task. The disability office helped provide the carbon paper for them to use, or alternatively we would go make copies of their notebook pages on the copier after class and the college would reimburse them for copying fees. That way still works. 

But tech is much easier these days. Maybe invest in a subscription to Otter. It transcribes and saves the text of convos and the audio so you can just reread the entire lecture. It also offers highlights. It puts the power back into your hands in case your notetaker gets sick or is absent. 

If you go through the disability office on campus (likely required if you're using either option because some professors do not like being recorded, ever,) they might be able to help you inform the professors ahead of time. A short letter to each professor (every semester) explaining your disability and accommodations you'll be using helps smooth the way as not all professors understand why you might need notes. 

You'll need to provide a recent audiogram and other related medical records to prove your need, and there's almost always an office on campus that is designed just to help with access. 

Do not wait until the last minute to set this up, the disability office should be open in the summer, too. I've had professors not understanding why I was ""so special"" and some were not pleasant about it. You want the campus advocate on your side and all the papers (proof) submitted before school starts.

It depends on where you are. For example, I'm in England so my advice as to the process only applies to here. Accommodations for university would be requested as part of DSA, disabled students' allowance. The process for getting that starts off by applying for it, listing all the disabilities and conditions you have with supporting documenation along with what you currently have in terms of support. After that, you'll have a meeting with an advisor to talk through what you need and make further suggestions. Then they send those suggestions to the funding body who decide which ones to fulfil and which to deny. You'll later get a summary of what you're receiving and eventually receive any equipment the funding body did not deny.

Accommodations for primary and secondary school are a bit harder as the only legal requirement lies in an EHCP, education, health, and care plan. For that, it's a bit more specialised to the individual person, in my case it guaranteed a teaching assistant to help me follow the course of the lesson, repeating instructions if I didn't hear them and keeping me on task as the as-yet-undiagnosed ADHD did cause my mind to wander off at times. There were yearly reviews, discussions between me, my parents, and the deaf support centre staff about how I was doing with my current support and whether the EHCP needed to be updated. I should mention that I was lucky in that both my primary and secondary school had a Deaf Support Centre so were experienced with helping deaf students.

Wherever you are, it would be a safe bet that records of your deafness might be needed, medical reports and so on. But I have no idea how your system works.

I would add that it takes a lot of energy to focus without the notetaker. 

Which country are you in?

Ok so do you have an audiologist currently? You just have to have him write a note stating your level of hearing loss and why you would benefit from x service. I have them include the hearing test (able to get again every year. I don’t know why I have to keep proving curing deafness is not one of Jesus’ miracles). So I actually google literally every service that I qualify and ask for it. So you don’t have to use every single service but you can try it and see if it works. I’ve always felt better knowing I could use it if I needed to. Also note taker is a little vague and pretty much relies on the person deciding what is important. Transcripts are much better and getting word for word what the teacher said is amazing. Another hack: do online school where the presentation is like a zoom meeting. Why? Computer generated captions are life savers. Or video record if in person and then there are apps you can put the lecture thru that give you what was said. That way you have the board/slides/etc and what was said in the same video. Sorry if it doesn’t make sense with my explanation. It’s like midnight and I’m ready to sleep.

Public (and many private) college in the U.S. should have a form you can submit on their disability service website to request accommodations, they will probably require an audiogram or a note from an audiologist or both. If you want to expedite the process you can also email them and say you submitted their form and their documentation. They should assign you with a disability services advisor to help you too. I highly recommend CART over note taking but you have to find what works for you! I’m going into my junior year of college and have found that CART has helped me the most because it helps me understand what is happening DURING class rather than reviewing after, but that is just me. DM me if you need anymore help and best of luck!!",2025-08-04 06:21:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mh5xl4/how_do_i_request_a_note_taker_accommodation_for/
1mgt5a8,deaf,Do you prefer expressive subtitles?,"I watched a documentary on Criterion recently, called 32 Sounds, and the subs were kind of artistic/experimental for sound descriptions, nothing like what I'm used to. I mean things like:  
  
\[eggy fart\]  
\[farting continues\]  
\[fart loses momentum\]  
\[deep scraping, now with ghostly overtones\]  
\[shaking matchbox travels side to side and behind\] (for binaural/ASMR segment)  
\[cat purring contentedly\]  
\[whoosh! whoop!\]  
\[absolute silence\]  
\[minimalist piano melody filled with longing\]  
\[gong sounds modulating as if underwater\] (?)  
\[shin shin\] (Japanese term for the sound of snowfall)

Do you prefer this kind or more down-to-earth subtitles?  
  
(I myself am a hearing person, and a subtitler too -- though a different kind, so I'm quite curious.)



[댓글]
I think there's a fine line between 'expressive' and 'excessive'. Sometimes the captions include unnecessary opinions of the caption writer, which is bad practice.

Dig out the Russian movie ""Night Watch"" - a weird and dark urban fantasy movie. best subtitle job ever.

Not over the top, but the director was creative and smart about them. It is what I will judge every other subtitle job against.

Too much takes me right out of the immersion and makes me think about the subtitles. I should not be thinking about the subtitles.

Yeah watching movies on VLC player with SRT files, I always use SDH subtitles for this reason. Most of it is plain rather than expressive like in your examples. Expressive subtitles is better than nothing.

I prefer a middle ground, I only like expressive subtitles when there is sound that is vital to the understanding of the scenes, like (gas hissing) that may not be visually displayed. Or if there is a noise that is meant to serve a purpose but is unusual in its length or volume or eerie, I do prefer a descriptive sound, like (eldritch humming - - whistles to a stop) but for a door scraping or a fart I do not need to know if it’s squeaky or eggy.

1mgs25p,deaf,Update: Deaf Girlfriend,"As a bit of context I suggest you read pre my previous posts.

https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/s/r9HOApSTGY

A TLDR:
I am a hearing guy who is dating a profoundly deaf women. 

I first posted on this sub, unsure of what I was to do when she first started flirting with me.

To cut a long story short it’s been great I am not conversationally fluent in BSL, I can’t match her speed (obviously) and I sometimes still finger spell the odd word I don’t know. But I understand 95% of what she signs. We’ve been on loads of great dates. 

A funny story from one was where the cafe waiter assumed I was deaf when coming to serve us which was interesting, as he just stood there and got his phone out to type on while I sat there confused as I was not used to that. 

Or another one when I accidentally launched a chicken nugget while trying to sign and eat on a date much to my horror. 

Or when I walked into a car while signing and walking (still hasn’t got the hand of that) 

Any way I would just like to say a massive thank you to this sub (I’ve been lurking) and for the links and resources. As they have helped me get to know and communicate with my wonderful girlfriend.

Awww you sound like my hearing husband, all the luck!

I'm a hearing guy who works for an organization that primarily exists to support higher education for deaf kids. Staff is half deaf/HoH, half hearing. Some of the most happy, stable relationships/couples I've observed over two decades here have been like yours. Usually that's between interpreters and deaf people, which obviously reduces that communication barrier, so I have a ton of respect for you sticking it out, learning the language, figuring out all of the little things that are a little bit different for deaf people that most people don't understand. Happy for you!

Thank you for sharing! I hope that you continue to enjoying and growing as you go.

Awww so glad you’ve found eachother

So cute! I started learning sign to approach a deaf girl I had a huge crush on back in the day. Love this.

My favorite is when a learner is signing so fast or enthusiastically they accidentally smack themselves in the face. Kinda reminds me of biting your cheek/tongue when talking too fast lol

🥹❤️

💖😍💖 I love this so much. Thank you for sharing

This is so sweet to read omg. Happy for y’all

This made me smile so much! I (48F, hearing) am married to my Deaf husband (52M), and your stories brought back so many memories of our early dates. The nugget-launching accident? Been there—except in my case, I once flailed an entire to-go coffee cup across a café while trying to sign “thank you” to him. 😅 We still laugh about it.

I completely relate to the pace adjustment, too. I’m still not “conversation fluent” in ASL (working on it!) and fingerspelling random words is definitely my fallback move. But honestly, so much of it comes down to presence, patience, and humor—which it sounds like you two have in spades.

It’s heartwarming to hear how intentional you’ve been about learning and connecting at her pace. From my experience, those small daily efforts matter way more than perfection. You’re creating a rhythm together, and that’s where the real connection happens.

Thanks for sharing your update. It’s refreshing to see more people normalizing Deaf/hearing relationships and celebrating the quirks that make them unique. Wishing you both many more (hilarious) date adventures ahead. 🙂

best of luck ... some things ive learned as i switched to pretty much asl only is things will go flying, you very quickly discover your personal bubble is very dangerous area and also that you will trip more when paying attention to a partner signing .. best of wishes and be careful not to launch any more nuggies :P

I feel happy for you, but mostly your girlfriend.  
Read the post in your link.  
I flirt a lot too, but when a guy my age finally dares to approach me and finds out I am deaf, they walk away laughing or with a grin as if I am some kind of alien in disguise.  
Older men that dare to approach me usually apologize using hand gestures or still with voice and slowly back away.

It makes me said that being deaf still is a major factor for men with no disabilities themselves.  
So, reading that there are men that don't care if a girl/woman is deaf really makes me sincerely happy.",2025-08-03 19:26:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mgs25p/update_deaf_girlfriend/

1mghqv0,deaf,Should an 83 year old give up on hearing aid improvements,"A friend of mine got his in the ear Phonak hearing aids from the VA a few years ago...He had experienced hearing loss for over 50 years and ignored it until then.

At this point his hearing with these aids is really awful. He went back to the VA several times for a tune up"" but said they didn't help.

He will not consider cochlear implants nor over the ear aids.

He just gave up...Said he was told that there is nothing that can b done at this point.

Could that possibly b true?  Any new developments that he could look into?







[댓글]
If he’s experienced hearing loss for 50 years, it may be more that his brain no longer knows what to do with all the input than it’s not “loud enough.” 

He probably needs auditory therapy at this point to make them more effective, although at 83 the brain is far less plastic than it used to be, so it’s questionable how much that would help.

From your post it doesn't show but it's always best to consult several audiologists.

Hearing aids fitting always require patience and regular feedback over a longer time span. 

It's my personal observation but I feel like older people tend to give up after one or two visits and just put up with it and will make excuses why it's not working.

The in the ear aids seem to be very difficult for many older folks. I feel bad that these are pushed on old folks by audiologists, they did this to my mom. They're hard and uncomfortable and too tiny for many folks to grasp and get in properly. I asked for a different style for her but even then she didn't like them. I'm guessing that if he won't get behind the ear aids with more comfortable molds he may as well give up. That's going to be hard for anyone who needs to communicate with him.

There are aids called “power aids”.  They are really strong for severe to profound deafness.  But - these are behind the ear style.  Now these are really small compared to when I wore them. People don’t really notice them.  People do notice if you can’t hear what they’re saying. Hearing loss can bring on isolation and frustration which can lead to dementia due to not being active. I’d suggest he ask his audiologist to try the BTE style and see if it makes an improvement for him and if he can get used to them.

&gt; He just gave up...Said he was told that there is nothing that can b done at this point


Not with regular hearing aids, no. But he shouldn't give up entirely. He may be a candidate for an implant of some kind.


&gt; He will not consider cochlear implants nor over the ear aids.


For fuck's sake. Won't consider a BTE? (Behind the ear) I've got no sympathy for him. I lost my hearing in my teens and 20s due to unavoidable natural causes. Due to the nature of my hearing loss I never got good results from a hearing aid. 


&gt; hearing loss for over 50 years and ignored it until then.


That was his biggest mistake. People who start early as possible with hearing aids still get some utility when they're in your friend's situation. Best you can do is advocate and educate others. The VA is probably the best source for hearing aids, the second best source is Costco. 


Nothing can be done for your friend. Not due to technology, but due to his fear or hubris or whatever's going on in his head.

Do you mean behind the ears hearing aids?

It’s impossible to know based on your description, if it’s your friend that is unreasonable and stubborn or if it’s you who have unrealistic expectations about the hearing. Visit the audiologist together with them, and order CART for the appointment. You have the right to. Then you’ll get a better picture.

Nothing prevents an older person with good health to get a CI and it can greatly improve quality of life. Plenty of factors can influence.

When you are at the audiologist, you should discuss what accommodations and communication techniques there might be to facilitate communication. There are all sorts of ways to improve the situation, but you need to be involved with the audiologist and your friend in order to know what good strategies are in your case.",2025-08-03 12:13:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mghqv0/should_an_83_year_old_give_up_on_hearing_aid/

1mgff5m,deaf,Teaching Deaf children chess,"A deaf school's teacher recently contacted me to teach the students of their school chess. I am wondering if there can be interesting technique to make those children learn chess from scratch. I was thinking of making some basic animated presentation to help them grab the initial idea.   
Can anyone suggest something? 

[댓글]
Animated presentations and maybe cheap mini-chess boards in front of each student to follow along with, because I think some tactile connection to the pieces is helpful. I would visit each table or desk to engage a little with eye contact. I am sure the school can help with having an interpreter, but I would also ask if they have had someone else try this in the past. Maybe they can communicate to you what worked, what didn't, what students liked, what they did not like.

It's not particularly hard to teach deaf children how each chess piece can move and their names. It can be trickier to teach strategy etc. I was a member of my deaf school's chess club even though I was too impatient and opportunistic to think far ahead enough! :-)

Actually very interesting.


My advice would be - go as visual as possible.


You can and should ask in advance whether this school uses sign language or not. 


If it does - learn the signs for the pieces (you can make this a fun thing for them, ask the kids directly to teach you). When you describe moves - do so by tracing them out in the air, or maybe moving around in space pretending to be a pice. Show them the movements on the board. Work with the interpreters to have them perhaps do these motions (so describe the motions in detail so that the interpreters can perform them. Something like 'so the knight leaps over the bishop two spaces, before going one space right to take the pawn'). Make sure, however, that you talk towards the students even if translated via interpreter - you are talking to them, the interpreter is just the a tool being used (albeit a well respected and decently paid tool)


If they are not a sign language school then a few things apply. Make sure your set up allows you yo be facing them so they can read your lips. Make sure the lighting on you is good. Make sure you aren't mumbling. Those are all basic stuff for communicating with oral deaf people. But also - the visual method would still be very useful - just make sure you pair it with speech. Perhaps use animations, or moving the peices in very clear ways!


Of course tailor this to the age range. If its young children, go big and fun. If teens, take a more serious and respectful approach.


If you usually work in comedy when teaching chess to children - aim to do so with visual jokes rather than language based jokes or puns. Stuff like *sniper bishop* but not ""porn sounds like something else we don't mention"".


Genuinely sounds fun! Good luck!!

Go heavy on the visual aids.",2025-08-03 09:55:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mgff5m/teaching_deaf_children_chess/

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

In Canada every phone company runs their own relay for their own customers. You'll have to check with your specific phone company 


For number two though, the relay operator should only act as a conduit for communication they're not going to say anything if you don't type it. There are some standard abbreviations though. Again you'll want to check with your specific phone company.

I use T-Mobile IP relay. When you type in parentheses, the relay operator will read it and not voice it. So you can leave notes and instructions there. 

They aren’t supposed to say anything without you typing, but they will sometimes. When giving my street name or email address, I’ll add in parentheses “verify spelling” so they make sure the other person receives it correctly. 

One more thing I wish I knew sooner, relay operators cannot scroll up and read the conversation from the start. You may need to repeat information. I like to call from my computer. I can have a document with phrases I know I’m going to say. I can copy and paste it during the call.",2025-08-03 04:38:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mgafkq/some_questions_about_ip_relay/
1mg82a6,deaf,Is there a polite way to decline signing?,"I am very new to profound hearing loss.  I don’t know much ASL at all.

how about “I don’t use sign for communication, please write it down for me”? anyone who takes takes issue with that is no ally anyway. but hopefully most people would understand that they can’t assume all DHh people communicate via sign

honestly i feel u. im also profoundly deaf. i know some sign language, but never got to use it due to my family refusing and forcing oralism onto me. i wish ppl asked if signing is okay instead of assuming all deaf people are comfortable signing. very rude that they assume youre not actually deaf bc of it. deaf people have different upbringings/experiences.

what i do is simply be direct and say ""i cant sign rn, can u use ur phone/write, thank you"" ive been deaf from childhood and while i appreciate when ppl sign at me, they should ask before, or respect that some prefer communicating w writing.

&gt; I have bigger fish to fry than being someone’s signing practice.


Trust your gut, if this is the kind of vibe you're getting, you're likely correct. In a case like this you're not obligated to be polite.


Even if you learn more sign language there will be plenty of cases where you prefer English, your first language. I don't know why people have such a hard time understanding I'd rather use the language I grew up with and use every day instead of the language I was very fortunate to learn as an adult. 


Sure I love using ASL in a casual or social setting, but a legal or medical setting, no way, I'm not that fluent.

Just bring a notepad,  write your verbiage down.  If they sign,  underline the part about writing and give them the notepad.

1) Practice your signing a lot. You won’t improve unless you work on it. I know it’s a long journey, but do make the effort. It won’t take long before you find signing to be more and more useful. 

2) With that said, of course you need to decline using it as an accommodation anytime you don’t feel it will work well. As a beginner, of course you can’t sign efficiently. Note that there is no way for those who meet you to know you’re late deafened. Be patient with them, or they will have a negative impression that will make it harder the next time they meet a Deaf person. If this happens regularly, just print a small card with some polite message about you being new to sign language and prefer writing. You can naturally sign something like that too, but I have a feeling many would find that less convincing.

Just say I don’t sign. Thats what I do when I prefer written or spoken language.

I get this too, although I do sign. A lot of people have a overinflated sense of how well they sign, so.. it’s more effective to write. I just smile because they’re trying to be nice, wave my hand no, and tap my pen on paper, and make the writing gesture sign.

Fwiw, I'm sorry this is happening to you. 

Maybe edit out ""deaf"" from the message. ""I communicate via writing.""

I suck at signing. Just write, “I don’t know ASL. Please write.” I’m profoundly deaf too. I highly recommend the implant! I tried the hearing aids when I was a kid, they never worked but that was over 30 years ago lol. I got my surgery in 1998.

How about ‘I am *newly* deaf, please communicate in writing’?

Have you tried using Google’s Live Transcribe (Android phone or tablet) or Live Caption (iPhone)?  This would be a lot faster for communication than writing would be.  Make sure the devices’s microphone is pointed towards the speaker, especially if you’re using an iPhone.

One reason people would want to sign with you is probably because it’s a LOT faster than writing is when all participants know sign language.  Setting up speech recognition on your own phone will facilitate faster communication that works better for the other party if they can talk clearly.

By the way, if you live in the USA, you can use federally funded relay services like InnoCaption for telephone calls.

I appreciate your wording myself but unfortunately sometimes you have to be reeeeally direct with people. Especially if you get the vibe they want to use you as signing practice, that’s rude and pushy behavior. I would consider adding something like “I don’t sign” / “Please don’t sign” / “No signing, please communicate by writing” etc to your initial note. Something that not only asks them to write but makes it very clear you do not want to sign.

Are you able to speak clearly? If so, just say it. ""Stop, I don't use sign."" Tip toeing around their feelings about signing isn't helping themselves or you.

definitely do not discourage them from trying to sign with the next deaf person they meet. just kindly write that you don’t know ASL yet

I recently suffered from significant sudden hearing loss due to an autoimmune disease and a stroke.  I use a speech to text app on my phone a lot and find it very useful.  Someone recommended the otter app to me and I like it a lot.

Learn “hearing impaired little sign know”. Not rude, you are signing on command, and the person doesn’t take it personally

Um, which one are you getting?

I have the Osia, which has a biggish piece under the skin, and the processor is held on with a magnet. There's no healing cap to wear for this, since it's fully covered by the skin.

A normal BAHA (like a 'baha max 6' model) has an abutment that sticks through the skin. That gets the little cap that you gotta wear for a bit.
 
The surgeries are different between the two. The Osia/magnetic style is the more invasive surgery. But less maintenance after.

If you go look for my posts in /r/monohearing there's a couple longish posts about my surgery and recovery.

There’s videos on this surgery on you tube. It looks pretty ok ish. I don’t have it yet. I’m debating. 

Try dry shampoo post surgery. They shave hair and you wear a cap only for a short time, back to daily life soon. Activation 5 weeks post.

Yall I knew implants were needed but this is making me think if I ever go deaf I might just be stuck with ASL cuz I couldn’t make myself get that surgery. Props to you 😭 🙏 ♥️

Not sure what that is? I had the cochlear implant done in 1999? I was the first patient ever to be able to leave the same day. I was still groggy haha. They shaved the area and cut behind my ear and peeled it back. Minimal scarring actually! Healing process took maybe a month before I actually got the processor.

Not really but it would be weird

I'm alarmed at the amount of people in the comments who apparently don't have favorite words 😂

This question would be more of a p.s or kinda of a side note, not the entire purpose of the sign.

No why would it be disrespectful. If it’s interrupting the concert I’d say maybe wait till end

1me3ss2,deaf,"Interpreters Are Always Offered, But What About Captioning?","Has anyone else experienced how difficult it is to request captioning for events or venues? Interpreters are almost always the default accommodation offered, but when I ask for captioning instead, it’s like I’m asking for something unusual or complicated.

I’m an ASL user and I do communicate in ASL, but I personally prefer to receive information in English. Captioning has always worked better for me, especially in settings where things move fast, or where exact wording matters. With captions, I don’t miss names, terminology, or side comments. It’s clear and efficient.

I just wish venues understood that not all Deaf/HoH people benefit the same way from interpreting. We should be able to ask for what works best for us without having to explain ourselves over and over.

Does anyone else feel that way?

[댓글]
Yep, asking for CART is totally within your rights.

I can't sign much at all.  Slowly getting there.  But late deafened.

Yes CART is often an after-thought or people aren't familiar with it.

On the other hand it's sometimes available even in places you wouldn't expect.  A lot of movie theatres have captioning available for users.  Never knew that all these years until recently.

In some situations like medical stuff that's important I insist on either everything written down by the speaker or CART.

Only time I’ve been successful getting CART is for college classes. Most venues in my area have contracts directly with interpreters. The local agency offers CART, but the agency is an extra step in this case. 

I don’t think we’ll see live CART operators very often. Auto captioning is getting better. Good stenographers usually have steady gigs in schools or courts.

It’s definitely challenging for in person events. Transcribers or cart type services tend to be difficult to find (depending on where you are), training is not always available, people overthink the tech required for them etc.  

it’s something that honestly should be included everywhere especially in large events where people could have trouble hearing but don’t want to take the step of formal accommodations. 

I do have to say your results may vary because I did cart in university and my transcriber kept falling asleep midway :/

Yeah, most hearing people have been exposed to interpreters, not live captions or CART.

Most places I get both, but at work for in person events they always have CART and never remember to schedule an interpreter. I get the sense my CEO doesn’t like sharing a stage… I haven’t complained too loudly at CART works better for me if there are slides to read. The code switching is hard for me to go ASL to English reading.

It always seems awful for some reason too, im rarely given a live captioner but some sort of remote listener doing the captions instead - and theres always issues with mics, accuracy, etc etc.

I'm the same way,  the best I can suggest is to keep advocating for CART and captioning in general.  I went to a No Kings rally in a city near me and they had an ASL interpreter but heck I could barely see them from where I stood, even ASR would have been better they could have done a BYO-device and something like zipCaptions. But hearing people don't know about these kinds of things, they see the deaf/hoh world as a monolith.

I’m the same in that I prefer captioning. I ask for this accommodation first before an interpreter to see if they have it as an option. I also use apps as well to get my own captions.

I don’t have much problems getting one but i guess different country.

As someone who is late-deafened and still not fluent in LSF (working on it but merely conversational for now), I wish more people thought of captioning as an option for accessibility, interpreters are undeniably a must but captioning can provide access to late-deafened people and also d/Deaf people who grew up without access to sign language as a result of oralism.",2025-07-31 14:56:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1me3ss2/interpreters_are_always_offered_but_what_about/

[댓글]
I used to drive Uber. I have seen instances of hearing drivers put down ""deaf"" so they don't have to talk to people. I've also seen passengers straight up say that they automatically decline drivers that are deaf for safety concerns.

You're venting about Deaf people to deaf people? 

Or venting about people fake Deaf? 

I do not understand this or about you wanting a friend. 

You were hope Lyft driver will be your friend?

Sorry I am trying understand what exactly happened.

I wish they would just say they prefer to be quiet during the ride to focus or something.

I think this post is worded a bit confusingly. Are you saying that you have seen Lyft drivers put ""Deaf/HoH"" on their profile when they are actually hearing? And they do that because they don't want people to talk to them? 





You are saying that you tried to sign to them (As you know sign language) and the driver appeared confused because they don't know sign language. You were trying to be accommodating, but they were just abusing the system to get out of talking to people?

  


If the above is correct, it might 50/50 reading comprehension and wording/punctuation on the main post. I had to re-read it carefully to get a better idea of what I thought you meant. If the above is correct, that is a very valid vent and concerning behavior from the Lyft drivers.

Oh my god, people are reading too much into your post, OP. It’s really not hard to understand why you’re upset. However, people may not understand what all was included in the automated message you received. It might help to edit your post to add the actual message *in quotes*, like this:

&gt;“Driver is deaf or hard of hearing. Use text to communicate. Learn “hello” and “thank you” in American Sign Language.”

That Lyft driver was flat out rude. Not only is he faking being deaf, he acted like you were the weirdo for being polite and doing exactly what the Lyft message directed you to do. 

I get faking deaf in order to avoid conversation, but don’t look at people sideways when they believe you’re deaf. It makes it so much worse that he rebuffed your kind gesture of signing to him. 

People like this are exactly why I developed so much social anxiety growing up hoh. It’s genuinely isolating.

Uber/Lyft confirms your name to confirm he picked up the right person. After that you don’t even have to speak to them. You’re doing too much and complaining about it and who calls Lyft drivers looking for a friend?

This happens to you frequently, does it? A hearing person pretends to be deaf while driving for a ride share app and even has the audacity to scold you on their profile that you should learn please and thank you in sign, though they are themselves faking?

Sure, Jan

I’m HOH/ single sided deaf. I know a very tiny bit of ASL. I understand your frustration when you finally get a deaf driver you want to sign with and it’s all a rouse! Terrible.

1mctcaj,deaf,"Just watched ""The Way We Talk"" – a touching Hong Kong film on Deaf identity and culture","Hi everyone,

I recently watched a 2024 Hong Kong drama film called The Way We Talk (Chinese: 看我今天怎麼說), and I wanted to share it here because I think it might resonate with many in this community.

The story follows a young woman who uses a cochlear implant. After befriending a sign language enthusiast (played by Neo Yau), she starts to question her identity and whether she should continue trying to integrate with hearing society or embrace the Deaf community.

The film explores some deep and emotional issues around language, belonging, communication, and self-acceptance. I found it very moving and thought-provoking. It doesn’t shy away from the complexities and real-life conflicts that many people who are Deaf or hard of hearing face.

Has anyone else seen it?

Highly recommend if you're interested in films that explore Deaf culture and identity.

[댓글]
I haven’t seen it, but I’ve excitedly added it to my list! Thank you for sharing about it.

That sounds pretty interesting.  I'm quite deaf (since 3), but highly functioning.  I don't know sign language and have no speech impediment.  Functioning in a hearing world was and is my default setting.  As such, I've had no involvement with the deaf community.  I wore hearing aids growing up.   At the time I got the CI in college, I had no idea how divisive it was in the deaf world.  When a deaf girl came up to sign to me one day in college, I didn't know what she was saying.  After that, she made it clear that I was betraying the deaf community.  At that point, I did all I could to avoid anything related to the deaf world.  They became ""not my problem.""   I'm older now - married to an awesome woman.  She's always had an affinity to the those who are challenged, like autism and deaf world long before I met her.  She did volunteer work to help those communities during her her school and college years.  We recently discovered Sue Thomas TV show and subsequently the real life Sue Thomas.  My wife is encouraging me to learn to sign because she wants to sign too.  It's raised all kinds of mixed feelings, everything from curiosity to fear of losing my identity, as not knowing how to sign and lack of speech impediment made me unique in ways.  I'm curious as to how this documentary would affect me.

Just watched the trailer and it looks really interesting! These kinds of films are so important for raising awareness about the real struggles people face with identity and belonging.

He's not the only researcher who got funding cancelled. RIT/NTID lost millions as did Gallaudet.  I work at an R1 university and we got $3.4M cancelled.  I prefer not to name the school.

On one hand this really ticks me off. On the other I like being deaf! lol

Fuck you, orange child raping anal fissure!

Wait, did you hear about how they canceled a “cochlear diversity” study because it had the word diversity in it? This administration is a detrimental abomination. Such a shame for this country.

I refer you to the strapline of this subreddit.  Pasted below in case you are on mobile &amp; cannot see it:

**we cannot hear! yay!**

There are many distinct Deaf communities around the world, which communicate using different sign languages and exhibit different cultural norms. Deaf identity also intersects with other kinds of cultural identity. Deaf culture intersects with nationality, education, race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, and other identity markers, leading to a culture that is at once quite small and also tremendously diverse.

From the article I read, it seems to me that his original funding was for workplace diversity.  That can't be the only way to fund this.  The way I see it, it has nothing to do with diversity.  On a side note, we're nearly $40 trillion in debt.  At some point funding for anything at all won't be there.

A lot of Deaf scientists lost funding.

Next he will cancel the speech to text for phones that right now is free with prof of hearing loss. Then closed captioning will be no longer mandated. He’s a f#cker. And hates us.

That’s awful. So many things are being cut.

I figured that it was canceled because it didn't benefit Trump personally.

It’s good that this grant got cut, though. I mean, members of the Deaf community are pretty proud of having hearing loss. Sad for others who don’t consider themselves Deaf (with a capital D, for emphasis). Not good that Trump is cutting all kinds of stuff.

Adults with hearing loss currently have nothing but this [https://www.rinri-therapeutics.com/hearing-loss/](https://www.rinri-therapeutics.com/hearing-loss/) Human trials begin in only the UK late this year so it will be years before there's a chance real and affordable cure.

1mcjptb,deaf,Advice needed! Appointment with client who is deaf/hoh,"I'm a receptionist at a local business and I'm about to have an appointment with a client that is deaf/hoh. We briefly spoke over the phone through an interpreter to schedule the appointment. I don't know ASL but I want to make sure we're able to communicate properly since the line of business I'm in is very sensitive and needs accurate information. 

I wanted to ask if it would be alright for me to put paper out for us to both write on, or if that would be considered rude. I don't know any details on if someone is coming with them or if they know how to read lips/how much hearing they have. I'm just a little stressed about how to make them feel comfortable and heard. Any advice or suggestions are welcome!

[댓글]
Call your client on the number they gave for calls or the other number they gave for texting. Ask them how they prefer to communicate in person. 

If your line of business is sensitive and needs accuracy, hire an interpreter. VRI may be acceptable in an office. 

Personally, I use a relay to make calls, but in person appointments I can get by without accommodations or maybe just my captioning app.

Some deaf people don't mind using their voices, but I have found that when I speak to others they expect me to hear. That's frustrating.  I often flat out tell people I'm deaf, but that rarely works.  I also don't usually tell people how to communicate with me because that usually doesn't go well. The person makes a scowl or other non-verbal indicators that they didn't like being told what to do.  So, for these reasons it's best to ask. 

\&gt; I wanted to ask if it would be alright for me to put paper out for us to both write on, or if that would be considered rude.

Not rude at all, just don't make any assumptions about their English reading ability or their intelligence. If they use what appears to be broken English, it's probably a pidgin called ASL Gloss, They're doing their best and it's not their fault or necessarily indicative of their intelligence if they don't have full mastery of written English.  

We (deaf people) are pretty used to meeting hearing people half way when it comes to communication. Doing your part to mitigate the communication barrier without the air of superiority or bigotry would be a well welcomed change from the norm.

All the things you suggested are fine. If an interpreter is coming with the client, look at the client instead of the interpreter. If the client reads lips try to look in their direction as much as possible or write on paper if the client doesn’t understand. Learning a couple basic signs like the alphabet or common words that you use a lot in your field is great too.

If possible, use a speech to text app if you need to talk lots and don’t have time to write it all down

1mcizga,deaf,"Newly deaf, how to go out in public and communicate?","My hearing is gone and I’m an adult and I don’t know how to function.

Is there a book or website where you can learn how to handle public situations?  I try to write on my phone or paper, but people still try to talk and if they ask a question in writing and I answer verbally they think I’m lying about behind deaf.  I don’t know ASL.  I’m waiting for a cochlear but it might be months.  I just need to go to the grocery store or order but it’s more complicated than I imagined.  There aren’t many resources for adults. Is there a how to for the newly profoundly deaf?

How can I explain I can’t hear but I can talk fine? But can’t read lips etc.  Some people try to sign and seem judgmental that I can’t.  I am tired of trying to explain this just happened but it was later in life to a McD cashier who can’t understand why I can’t sign with her
and why I don’t “sound dead.”

You already discovered that most hearing people cannot comprehend that some can be deaf and speak. Many find they get better cooperation by going voice-off in public and using apps or pen/paper.

You may find this link to a conversation helpful. It isn’t a how-to but it is a good discussion. You’ll need to register on the site. It’s free. The AllDeaf site activity has declined since its glory days but a lot of older stuff is still available and relevant.

Adjustment to late onset deafness
https://www.alldeaf.com/community/threads/adjustment-to-late-onset-deafness.62953/

You said you have not learned to sign. I strongly encourage learning some even if you don’t gain full fluency. It will open additional doors of communication access and social circles. You can start learning for free at https://www.lifeprint.com/index.htm. Go to the ASL lessons section and you’ll find a very thorough course with videos.

Oh yeah I get that a lot. I’m born with hearing and learned to talk orally but I have a genetic defect that make me lose my hearing pretty quickly and I’m almost totally deaf now. 
A lot of people doesn’t believe me or think I’m exagerating (why the fuck would I? Where is the fun in asking someone to repeat lmao).
If they don’t get it after you briefly explain, they simply aren’t worth your time.

For important situations where miscommunication is not acceptable (like me at the hospital the other day) I suggest what some of other commenters say -- go voice off.

If you speak they assume you can hear/respond.  It's automatic and unavoidable.  So stop talking.  Stop responding to people presumably talking other than gesturing that you are deaf.  

It should be the very first thing you communicate to someone when you interact with them.  People will forget.  So even if you know them, communicate it again, like to the cashier each time even if it's your regular cashier.  

And do not proceed further with communication until you're on equal footing - both of you writing back and forth in this case, most likely. 

I can't be bothered with people who can't be bothered.  Good to get them out of the way ASAP.  For services I need and can't avoid I just get gently persistent.   

Every staff member I made eye contact with ""Hi, just so you know I'm deaf"".  First thing I said to the triage nurse: ""Hi, I'm deaf.  I won't hear my name called.  Where should I sit/stand?"".  First thing to the next nurse: ""Hi I'm deaf"" and etc.  They led me right into the ER rather than waiting in the main room in that case.  Beats my old strategy of looking around to see if anyone gets up when someone comes into the room and then, if no one does, assume it must be me called.  Lol.

If people are rude to you, I suggest using some of the rude gestures you probably already know. :)

&gt; But can’t read lips etc

Hearing people use their visual channel for speech too.  (Look into the McGurk effect in psychology.)  You have more innate lipreading ability than you probably imagine.  Lipreading without CI or some residual hearing is almost impossible though some can in some contexts partially.  

&gt; out in public

You'll also adjust.  For example, you probably feel hyper-vigilant.  Who is behind me?  Where are people?  Deaf people look around a lot more.  Eventually this will become automatic and non-exhausting.  Or at least less exhausting, and not associated with a heightened state of stress/fear response.  I'd say it was about half a year for me before I started feeling confident with traffic and crowds and such, after I went from mild-moderate -&gt; severe overnight.

Just here to say that my husband is in the same boat as you and I'm here trying to find resources as well. Were waiting on his hearing aids to come in and see if they help at all, yhen we'll look into cochlear. So far he uses a transcribe app that seems to help ppl understand he can't hear them. But it's the speaking slowly or speaking and looking away that become the most frustrating for him. 
We've started learning ASL as a family with youtube and there's some self paced courses available on uedomy (sp?) And through the library of congress.

When I was newly injured I had basically no hearing and this was a huge challenge, and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s incredibly frustrating and to be honest, people will not understand. People get so frustrated with me, and I have regained most of the hearing in one ear but it’s still not enough to be functional in a “hearing” world if you know what I mean? 

People have accused me of faking because I can speak fine, and I can hear ok in one-on-one quiet environments. My ex boyfriend used to accuse me of flirting with everyone because I lip read to understand. 

Lip reading will come with lots of practice. Learning asl is hard, but you can do it! 

I wish I had more advice, but I’m relatively new to this world as well. It is very hard, but you’re also very strong ❤️

Don’t speak. 


Only communicate via wrong, most people don’t understand that speech does not equal hearing.

First off! Wow that’s a lot to navigate and it’s so unfortunately sad we don’t have more help and assistance in place for those who lose their hearing later in life. You’re not alone in this feeling, and I’m sure it feels quite overwhelming. I recommend you brush up on some ASL as a new tool for you to navigate both worlds. There’s full videos on YouTube from a deaf professor who wanted people to be able to access ASL education for free, and it’s all taught in sign, so no hearing needed!. That will help when you find people who know ASL that are both hearing, Deaf, etc. any increase you can find in access to your ability to communicate and gathering information about your world the better! ASL is a great place to start. Secondly, I’d recommend trying to find some Deaf socials in your area and just show up and ask questions. Deaf socials are all about coming together, and finding belonging. You’ve entered a new world, with a whole new culture and history! How exciting and there’s people like you out there happy to welcome you. People are events like this will also hold tons of solutions from their own lived everyday experiences that they can share with you. And by hanging out with other Deaf people you can learn from observation how they navigate various parts of the hearing world. 

Also, maybe on your notes app on your phone have a pre-typed message for service industry people. Says something like “I am Deaf, and can’t hear you, I can order by typing on my phone or pointing to the menu if you have a paper copy. Thanks!” And then as you walk up, wave and show them that. Usually most service people can follow that (hopefully!).

Accessibility settings in your phone you can caption what people say.

I frequent a grocery store who hired a deaf cashier. She had a little card on her chest beside her name (ie where a grocery store clerk name tag would go) where it writes ""I'm Deaf"" and she would point to it.

I sometimes sign to her (to practice my really bad asl) but she tends to go quite quick (since she's on the clock, she wants to go at the pace her grocery store training tells her to go at) - so no time for chit chat. More of a calm and fast competence, which is what all grocery clerks should aspire to.

She's awesome!

I'm sure you'll do fine too! Aspire to be like her! Good luck!

Depending on how loud a place is you can use automatic captions.  There are third party apps like Live Transcribe but that requires a monthly fee to use. My wife and I just switched to just using the captions the iphone has onboard and they work great.  You can use it with phone calls as well which is new.  My wife and I use facetime the most because it has captions and she can also read my lips.  We both switched to apple for their adaptive technology.

Google transcribe has been a life saver for me

""My brain's speakers stopped working. You have to text me.""

With drive thru - I just say I’m deaf so I can’t hear you but I’d like to order blah blah blah. But a lot of these places will let you place an order on an app then you can just say I have a mobile order. 
Grocery stores - I’m in my own world - I ignore everyone. If someone tries to talk to me, I apologize and explain that I’m deaf- they usually back off. 
People definitely will forget that you’re deaf and talk to you. Remind them again. 
Download otter.ai if you want to know what people are saying like at the dr office. It’s the best transcription app and I’ve tried several - it’s not perfect but it’ll do.",2025-07-29 18:14:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mcizga/newly_deaf_how_to_go_out_in_public_and_communicate/

In any case he told me that i didnt have to learn any sign to communicate with him but id like to make it easier and clear.any suggestions and what do you all prefer ?

[댓글]
Each deaf person has their own preferences of communication so it's best to ask him directly what he actually prefers. Just sit with him in a quiet moment and talk about it.

My mom used to send me to deaf camp every summer.  Each cabin was its own group, but 1 day out of the week we'd go on a camping adventure with all the other groups.  95% of the people there sign.  I don't know sign language myself.  That's when we'd all meet other people from across the camp.  Somehow, I made a friend with a deaf guy who signed but didn't really speak.  I learned the alphabet in sign language, and when it was too much, I'd write in the dirt what I was saying.    All that to say, if you're inclined to learn some ASL, do it.  Let it develop naturally, communication finds a way.

Have you ever seen your friend signing? If not, ask him if he knows any signing. If he says no, don't push him on it - it's his choice.  Sure, talk about how much you enjoy your own sign learning, it's not a taboo issue. 

I'm deaf &amp; a fluent signer, but I didn't learn it till I was about 30.  Many deaf people don't learn signing till later in life.  

In many countries there is a formal system of deliberately depriving deaf children of signing. In other words, keeping deaf children away from learning signing.

As deaf kids, we're often told it's bad for us, that it will wreck our speech, that it will make us unemployable, all sorts of lies. 

Hence many deaf non-signers have a ... complicated relationship... with sign language.  

As deaf adults, it takes a while to sort out all this internalised audism that has been fed to us as kids and make the jump into learning it.",2025-07-29 14:48:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mcdfv6/what_to_do/

So cute. 

You know it never occurred to me.  I feel silly now.  I've always worried a little about security and being alerted to things and ... well that's why we domesticated dogs.  Even hearing people appreciate how well dogs can hear.

Charlie just shifted my perspective.  Thank you two :)

That might just be the cutest dog I’ve ever seen.

Get another dog and have this one teach them! Dogs learn better when they have something they can copy

Love this! I’m on my second service dog and getting a second one was so hard. My old man was not happy

What service did you go through to get him? I feel like everything is more geared towards vision impaired

He’s a good boy!

I second the suggestion to get the next dog sooner than later to learn from Charlie. I also have a hearing dog. My older rescue picked up most tasks from her.

You can train the dog yourself. There's a book on Azon called (I think) Lend Me Your Ears. I used it for my third HD. My other dogs worked as best they could until they died, there were no overlaps.",2025-07-29 12:15:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mc9tiu/service_dog/
1mc4qem,deaf,Record for leaving the faucet running,"I’m profoundly Deaf, wear CIs around hearing people but prefer silence.
I got home from work a few hours ago and after eating dinner needed hot water to wash my dishes. I turned the sink on and left to wash my hands and…forgot about the water running for at least 2 hours.

[댓글]
Bro! I flooded the kitchen once! It went all the way to my room and there was almost an 1” of water. It seeped into the walls 😩🫣😭

My deepest sympathies for your water bill 😔

Are we sharing stories? 

When I was renting years ago I walked into my kitchen to see the sink overflowing on the floor. Thankfully, at least as far as I know, I caught it before any pooling had started. Who knows how much water ran down into the floor between the old floor boards, but I never heard anything from my landlord about the apartment below. 

As a homeowner, I almost left for an evening out with the bath filling up. Yikes. Remembered just before I'm out the door, run upstairs, the water was an inch below the top. Brutal.

Flooded my countertops 2 times. I left my watering system on outback for a whole day. Good thing it wasn't wide open but still it was a lot of water.

There's an iPhone alert for this. 

If it makes you feel any better, my hearing husband has flooded 2 bathrooms 🤦‍♀️

I did some research and came across this:  

[https://www.alzstore.com/automatic-faucet-control-p/0037.htm](https://www.alzstore.com/automatic-faucet-control-p/0037.htm)

For $30, that could save some tremendous headaches for us.  (Looking at you, u/fantasticstrain8940!) It's marketed towards people with Alzheimer's, but it would work for people like us.  I've done this more than once, and thankfully I've never had any real consequences.

I’ve left the faucet running twice this week. 
I’m so annoyed with myself.

Not deaf related. Maybe ADHD or something else doing on. I am Deaf, have many Deaf friends and the only people I know who do stuff like this, are hearing people with other distractions. 🤷‍♀️

Flooded my apartment which then flooded the apartment below me. 

Water went into the walls and the carpets were like swamps.

How long it ran, I don't know exactly, but I know it went overnight. 

To this day I feel grateful my apartment manager didn't charge me for damages (when I moved I received my full deposit back) even though both apartments had to ""re-home"" for 2 or 3 days.

Can you hear anything at all without your CIs? I have cheap water alarms set up under all my sinks, near my water heater, etc. and they absolutely SCREAM if the tiniest bit of water touches them. I can hear them without my HAs since they're so high pitched.

They're meant to alert you to leaks, but putting one on the countertop could save you from flooding your sink/kitchen/bathroom?

My condolences. 

The first time I left the water on (progressive hearing loss over time) I thought someone was in my house 😭

Just wait until you leave the water running upstairs bathroom and destroy the wall, ceiling, and carpet downstairs. My wife was pissed and I spent several weekends dry walling and painting.  At least we had a carpet cleaner to suck up the water and a few floor fans. Get yourself a water detecting alarm compatible with your home alarm system  SimplySafe has one.  Very easy to install a whole system.

I left the sink *and* the garbage disposal on. When I finally noticed the sink was on I ran to turn it off then decided I'd finish up the few dishes I had dirty so I started tossing the silverware in the sink.. you can imagine how that went 😅 
From that day on I always made a note to put my hand on the counter to feel if it was on when I went to the kitchen sink.

You can buy a touchless motion sensor faucet if this is a major issue.

They mostly use them in public kitchens/restroom but you can good a good enough one a little under $100 and it's honestly not super hard to install a faucet. You can always pay someone if you're not handy to install it.

i left mine on the whole night one time. i felt horrible and almost cried, it was the hot one too.

1mc4lrz,deaf,I'm a coda and I need advice,"I hope this is the right place to ask. Everyone in my family is hearing, except from my mom who's deaf. She also have a bad sight. My two sisters and I are in our 20s and 30s, and we've always been interpreting for and guiding our mother. In the grocery store, at restaurants, in family gatherings. 

The last few years, my sisters and I have gotten partners and my older sister is expecting a baby. We tried talking with our mother about getting professional interpreters for family gatherings. That way we don't have to ""work"" the entire evening interpreting, but we can catch up with our cousins, talk with our grandparents, or play with the children, like normal people do in family gatherings.

Our mother is stubborn, and doesn't want to use a professional interpreter. She says she thinks we do a good enough job. She doesn't seem to understand the work we put in to interpreting. Also, we can't make our partners learn sign language, if they don't have  the skills or time to learn it. An interpreter would help them communicate with eachother.

Are there any other Codas here who have similar experiences? Do you have any suggestions on how we can talk about this with our mother? How to help partners learn sign language? Do you use a professional interpreter in family gatherings?


[댓글]
Your mom seems selfish to me. 

I have three kids (currently 16, 14, and 7) and I have ALWAYS said these are my kids, NOT my interpreters. 

Even at the grocery store, I'd refuse for them to interpret for me. 

If I go somewhere and no one signs, I either don't return or find a different way to communicate. 

Just adding, hiring a professional is likely quite expensive, so if you're willing to give it a try, reach out to advanced college courses or terp programs and see if anyone is looking for practice.

You can also look for a professional terp willing to do side work.

No, it sounds like you’ve been great daughters for years. Your mom is just trying to postpone the inevitable. The hearing world happens and accommodates no man or woman. Why convince her beforehand? Get her an interpreter and she’ll see you need to mingle without her as a burden. Totally not meant that way but it is what it is!

&gt;She says she thinks we do a good enough job. She doesn't seem to understand the work we put in to interpreting

Of course she doesn't want to change it. The current system works for her, is free, and she doesn't have to do any extra work. It's awesome, from her perspective. 

It's more work for you and your siblings, but that doesn't affect her.

1mc1coj,deaf,Auditory exhaustion after adult hearing loss.,"I got sudden onset sensineural hearing loss on one side.  It’s completely gone.  It’s been months and I am finding that at some point I can’t take noise. I’m fine through the day, the kids are LOuD and I can block it out.  But by 7 my mind is jelly.  I find myself sitting apart from my husband and kids for dinner because voices after that time are sensory overload.  Ear plugs make it stupider because then I can’t hear at all and if I’m visible they want interaction.  But their talking like just normal talking is literally painful by evening.  Most days Im fine until evening and it resets overnight.  When does this get better?  I never had this before hearing loss.  Is there anything I can do to address this?  

[댓글]
\&gt; But by 7 my mind is jelly.

Yes, this is typical, I'm surprised you can make it until 7:00, my brain would be mush by about 4:00 or 5:00. 

When does it get better? When you accept that you're deaf and being able to get use of your residual hearing is a finite resource. You're not broken or lesser, just different. You'll want to explain the situation to your family, and stress that just can't listen with your ears by the end of the day. You'll need to use ASR, or typing or writing. People will need to speak in turns. Or all of you will need to learn sign language.  You can also do any combination of those options.  

Stress to your family that what you're going through is very common, and hopefully your whole family will have enough empathy to understand and meet you half way with communication.

Possible suggestion?  Hearing aids, nice ones with noise filtering.  This might sound counter-intuitive but you can turn them way down and not off.

I can't handle much noise.  I didn't have hearing aids thru my 20s and 30s and I seem to have lost a lot of the ability to block it out for the few things I still can hear unaided.  Maybe I'm just easily irritated.

When turned down I hear *less* overall with my hearing aids in and I often like it that way.  Even on lowest volume my hearing aids will make me aware of an overhead announcement or someone talking loudly or machinery etc. while serving as quasi-earplugs otherwise.

Are you giving yourself people breaks during the day? Sometimes I get ""peopled out"" and need to isolate and recharge.

I also suddenly went profoundly deaf in my left ear last summer. I got hearing aids in February and its a game changer completely. I feel like I can hear/feel a straight line through the inside of my head again and (especially once you get custom molds), they do a great job of filtering and reducing noise but also allow you to hear more of the important stuff. I recommend working with an audiologist and TRYING to get them through insurance. Just be sure to document everything they tell you. I feel you on brain mush and overall social withdrawal. I feel like I suffer from that still but the HA definitely make me feel like the dark ages are over and that there is hope. I'm also a singer and the idea of CI scares me a lot so HA have been a real blessing. Rooting for your recovery.

You might want to try a different earplug, or perhaps get custom high fidelity earplug from your audiologist. I wear inexpensive pressure filtering earplugs called “WeatherX” (found on Amazon). They dull the noise of my coworkers but I can still understand everything that’s said. But a high fidelity earplug will reduce pitch evenly without muffling and might be covered by insurance.",2025-07-29 03:49:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mc1coj/auditory_exhaustion_after_adult_hearing_loss/

We aren't born with the ability to speak or read. Why would we automatically know ASL or Braille? That literally makes zero sense.

I swear to god medical “professionals” are some of the biggest idiots on the planet. I once got set up on a blind date with an RN who asked me if I could sense earthquakes before they happened because of my deafness. When I went to the ER for a bursting gallbladder, a nurse brought me a pamphlet on CIs in between of bouts of vomiting. I don’t understand how or why they got here, except that they’re products of the mean girl to nurse pipeline 🙄

OP: that nurse is a blooming idiot.

&gt;You automatically wake up with all knowledge of asl when you go fully deaf; via a nurse.

I once woke up in Mexico. I could speak Spanish fluently. Obviously that's how it works. (insert sarcasm tell here)

LOL

I haven't had this happen yet, but I have had the test your deafness crap.  I've also had the come to my church and get healed nonsense.

I remember when I was in China, the doctor told me to turn my back to her and judge my hearing based on the distance. I couldn't stop looking at her, she was so unhappy. But that's not how it works. This is the method required during the college entrance examination physical examination.

I’m sorry! Medical people are just phoning it in for a paycheck these days

What a silly thing to say. Some people prefer to speak because they have clear speech and have done so since they were a kid.🙄

I’m profoundly deaf and had an interpreter all throughout school. I can read it but I can’t sign 😂 I’m really slow and it’s hard for me. Especially with my arthritis these days ☹️

People don’t understand how acquired disabilities work - not that I really think of being deaf as a disability, but for the larger population of hearies it is so using the term for convenience here.

The person in my life who most understands what I’m going through as I’ve become deaf is losing her sight. We are both living through the process of using new skills, different senses, to navigate the world and it is WORK. 

I think most folks either don’t know anyone who has a disability, or don’t know anyone who wasn’t either born with it, or was elderly and got written off because of age. The whole transitioning thing from someone who hears with ears, to someone who hears with sight is outside their frame of reference and they just can’t comprehend it.

Covering their mouths? Insta ignored. I don’t play with  adults who behave like this.

Unfortunately I’ve seen a lot of weird deaf people in the US deaf communities as example.

The matter that really profoundly surprised me is how some are outright rejecting deaf people with an implant because for them it means they rejected their lifestyle and culture.

I work in ems. I had a deaf/blind patient with CIs. I dropped him off at the hospital and told both the rn and the technician his history, so they were aware. The tech looks at me and goes, “can he hear?”. I think i gave her the most blank face “yes, he has cochlear implants”.

There’s something wrong with people. Everyday I am more baffled. 
Do we come out of the womb with a full understanding of our parents language? 
Could you imagine? You come out and start talking. 
So weird. How do people’s brains go there?

This is alittle dumb I mean imagine telling that to British deaf person who’s learning BSL💀

That's totally incorrect and wrong. Maybe these people are living in the Matrix where they can download ASL package to their brain.

Write it up as an executive order and get the autopen to sign it.  Then it will be true.

Infuriating

The Deaf keep doing an advocacy starting with ""sign language is Deaf's mother tongue"" at least here in Slovakia. Then sadly such outcome can be expected.

I have been deaf 22 years and dropped asl 1 in college because the professor was SOMEHOW a jerk like under this assumption. Like I couldn’t get through a class without a comment about how she couldn’t understand that I simply did not grow up with asl as a first or second language. I still know minimal asl.",2025-07-29 03:31:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mc0zj7/you_arent_deaf_cause_you_dont_know_asl_and_you/
1mbwyt3,deaf,Why do deaf people default to a falsetto voice?,"I find it super common online to hear people born deaf who cannot hear their own voice defaulting to speaking/making sounds in a falsetto voice, and this has never made any sense to me. Is there no instinct to make noises in your chest/speaking voice, and that that is a learned behaviour not heard by deaf people and thus not replicated?

[댓글]
Go ask speech therapists.

I go deeper when I don't have my CI on so that nulls your assertion already.

I have a lower voice than a typical female voice. I guess the polite way to say it is that I have a husky voice. 

But I have been called “sir” on the phone before.

I never knew this.  My spouse says I speak softer

The only thing I can imagine is that it helps avoid vocal fry? 

 I personally have not met deaf people who purposefully speak like that

I assume you used the wrong flair. 

I also assume that you’re exaggerating somewhat with “falsetto”. It’s not uncommon for deaf speakers to pitch up, especially on vowels, but hardly to the point of falsetto. It’s just an increase in nasality because it’s more resonant (more vibration in the sinuses/skull) so we get more feedback. 

There’s no instinct to speak with your chest because it’s not a universal in spoken languages. Germanic languages like English are produced with a more open glottis, whereas Romance languages like French with a more constricted glottis.",2025-07-29 00:17:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1mbwyt3/why_do_deaf_people_default_to_a_falsetto_voice/

1mbnvw7,deaf,Sudden profound hearing loss as an adult…questions about self-advocating.,"I’ve always had mild hearing loss my whole life, but literally overnight my left ear went to profound hearing loss.  I can hear nothing in that ear.  A hearing aid attempt only made tinnitus louder, I have zero ability to understand speech in that ear and no localization.  So now I have one ear mild, one ear profound loss.

I went in for a C-section and had asked for no music; they said I could make my own playlist.
I didn’t and they ignored my request and played music for the surgeon meaning I could not hear her talking to me or my husband even with him right at my head.  

I can’t hear my baby cry from a distance.  In many public locations I can’t hear at all when trying to order or talk to a cashier or hold a convo in a restaurant.  I tell the hostess I’m HOH and I still get put near a kitchen with people yelling and there can be no conversations.  

I don’t know what the hell to do?  How do you make people take your requests seriously.  How do you communicate with a cashier or someone when you can’t hear them at all?  And why has hearing loss made me dizzy?  I don’t know any ASL.  I’m not sure knowing it would really help.  And it’s hard with three kids, I don’t have hands free to always write or type to communicate.

This is a fun little [short](https://youtube.com/shorts/AKHLUjFDUvw) i made about a true story how i dealt with hearing loss !

I am making this channel and trying to grow it so i can help people see that it isn't all black when you lose your hearing. I specifically want to help Cl users (and hearing aid users of course) see through my stories and my experiences that life can actually be pretty awesome!

I know that my situation doesn't apply to everyone and that not everyone can be eligible for Cl's or even that it will work for them.( Or that you even want them ) But i remember that when i lost little of my hearing i was absolutely devastated actually and thought that my life as i know it was over...

That was stupid of me! And even without CI's my life would have been fucking fantastic!

I will upload videos ( and with subtitles everytime ) quite often so i hope they make you laugh!

Therapy is a great way to work through stuff like this. It can give you a safe, unbiased space to talk about your feelings and challenges. The therapist will guide you through it by asking open-ended questions and teaching you coping strategies. You don’t necessarily have to be mentally ill to benefit from therapy - everyone has stressors and needs support. If you’re struggling with anxiety or grief due to this sudden change, it’s absolutely worth it to try therapy. 

One thing to keep in mind is that you and your therapist need to be compatible. Sometimes you just won’t “click” with a certain person and that’s okay. So be comfortable with the idea of seeing more than one person before you find the right one for yourself (it took me a few, and I was glad I “shopped!”)

I recommend finding your peers and coming to a realization that u can still be safe, happy, and develop a new way of doing things.  Therapy helps, so does knowledge and practice.

I’m sorry you are dealing with this. I have a therapist who knows deaf issues and is fluent in asl. She helps me identify needs around my hearing loss, how to emotionally regulate. It’s about dealing with your emotions and processing your grief.

1ma4fqd,deaf,Double language barrier — any tips for communicating with a Deaf LSM user?,"Hey!
I’m casually seeing a Deaf guy from Mexico. He uses LSM (Mexican Sign Language) and Spanish. I’m hearing and speak English/French. He has a cochlear implant, but language barrier and not good for group settings.

We mostly use ChatGPT to communicate, but it’s slow and awkward especially in groups. I’ve tried learning some LSM, but most resources are in Spanish (which I don’t speak), and he only knows a little ASL. It’d be way easier if either of us shared a language.

I want him to feel included while he’s here as i feel he’s often left out in group settings. (just a couple more months).

Anyone have:
	•	App or tool suggestions for LSM ↔ English?
	•	Tips for bridging sign + spoken language gaps?
	•	Advice for group settings?

It’s been a reality check for how much i rely on auditory communication and how quickly i become useless when it’s stripped away.

Appreciate any help!

[댓글]
Do you mind giving us some context? Because I have more questions than answers;

1. You mention group settings - but what sort of group?
2. How serious is the interaction? Like just friendly chatting or medical info that *needs* to be conveyed accurately or in between?
3. Are you in Mexico or is he in a French/English speaking country (Canada)? Or are you in some third place like China?
4. What communication support does he already have? Interpreters? Notetakers? etc etc

Also;

&gt;App or tool suggestions for LSM ↔ English?

Categorically - **no**. And don't trust anything that tries to tell you it can.

Machine translation has not been solved. The hype around it and AI is hype. I say this as a linguist. It makes *lots* of mistakes and (now thanks to AI) hallucinates / makes shit up. This is because language use is often highly cultural and contextual in a way that machines struggle with - but even professional human translating / interpreting is a tough job that deserves respect.

Even more so, machine translation of sign languages is extra difficult. Its about 20 years behind spoken language machine recognition and translation.

&gt;Tips for bridging sign + spoken language gaps?

At the end of the day - *learn sign language* is the long term reliable solution.

LSM would be preferable - but even learning ASL would give you signing skills that you could transfer to conversations with him. You could also perhaps both learn some IS (International Sign, a pidgin language used by signers of different sign languages), and bridge that gap together.

&gt;Advice for group settings?

How cooperative is the group?

How willing to change the structure of the group setting are they?

There is a lot of basic stuff about deaf and hard of hearing access you could use.

1. Good lighting
2. Sit in a circle
3. Don't cover mouths
4. Talk one at a time
5. Repeat when requested to

But this mainly applies to DHH people with speech in the language the group is using. If they don't, then really they need an interpreter if they want to participate as an equal group member.

ChatGPT for communicating? I need to research that.

Hello, I am Mexican and I am currently learning ASL. I already have some knowledge of LSM and I have the perfect tool for you to learn LSM. Learning ASL is easy for me because my mind automatically translates the signs that deaf people make, so I don't really need to learn English (although I still want to learn it).

    PS: When I don't understand a word in English, I simply turn to Google or Google Lens.

ASL and LSM both come from Old French Sign Language, so that’s a plus for you! The grammar and syntax are very different but, ASL and LSM have a lot of cognates.

1ma43w5,deaf,Do you struggle to remember song lyrics?,"Like i know most of us with CI can’t listen to songs without seeing lyrics but i mean when you like a new song and see lyrics for first time then you repeat it again and you just can’t know all the lyrics without seeing them and like you need to listen with lyrics several and maybe lots of times to memorise it.
And the reason this came to my mind is that one time I was talking with my friend, and he said that once he sees the lyrics , the next time he hears the song, he automatically knows the words.

So I’m curious — is this something others with CI struggle with too, or is it just me?

[댓글]
Yes

Yep! All the time, lol.

I feel like it's a superpower that I've acquired that I can learn maybe 1-3 songs a year, depending. Each of my hearing family members have mental libraries of songs spanning several decades, though, so I've just accepted that it's naturally my limit. This is a great post, ty.

Idk where you're getting your info from but I can listen to songs without looking at the lyrics several times. 

Once I see the lyrics and get a general feel of the song, it's all pretty much committed to memory for the majority of the song. I'm kind of more like your friend in that aspect I guess.

I am profoundly hard of hearing and have been wearing one hearing aid all my life. The other ear doesn’t hear enough to allow two aids. This post is something I think about ALL THE TIME. I love 70’s and 80’s music. Thankfully, it still sounds good even though I have a bell-curve of hearing loss. But I cannot remember all the lyrics to any song. Not even the ones in my playlist that I listen to every day and have been for decades.

&gt;Like i know most of us with CI can’t listen to songs without seeing lyrics

What you do you mean? Is there a reason you can't hear the lyrics? 

It's common to mishear a few words in the whole song (for hearing people too), but it's pretty normal to be able to understand 95% of it.

I had sudden hearing loss.  I lost music.  It took me a year to hear the melody.  I don't hear much harmony. I certainly don't catch the words. My insurance company denied coverage for a CI.  I'm planning to appeal.  This thread has given me hope.  Thanks everyone!",2025-07-26 20:56:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ma43w5/do_you_struggle_to_remember_song_lyrics/
1m9qc9i,deaf,Is it rude when someone tells you to put your hearing aids in?,"For context, I am back home for university. 20 years old. I wear two hearing aids with severe to profound bilateral hearing loss. 

This morning, I didn’t put my hearing aids in as soon as I woke up, and we were eating breakfast and I spoke to my father but he still had his mouth full so he replied to me multiple times and then I realised why, I told him I can’t understand him when his mouth is full. He then snapped at me and told me to put my hearing aids in, I didn’t know what to say so he repeated himself and said that if I wore my hearing aids I’d understand him. 

I’m feeling a little hurt by this. Maybe it was the aggressive manner that he said it. I’m not sure. Any advice or answers? 

[댓글]
Does he realise that all your hearing aids would've done is made the incomprehensible noise of MMMM NNNN MMMMM NNNN even louder?

Hearing people really don't understand that all hearing aids do is make noises louder. They don't magically become any clearer.

""I'd understand you fine if you had the manners not to speak with your mouth full.""

It's rude from him, it's rude from anyone else.

My husband used to point to his ears and say “Are your hearing aids in?” when I couldn’t hear him, and I always found it incredibly insulting and annoying. In my case they are pretty much always in unless I’m going to bed. There was something about it that just instantly hurt my feelings/made me enraged. I finally got him to realize he’s just never allowed to ask that question. But your dad sounds more rigid and less respectful of you, so I wouldn’t count on having the same success. Maybe sometime you can talk to him about it when you’re not so upset, and hopefully he will realize he’s hurt you and he can work on not doing it again. If he keeps doing it after you say you don’t like it, that says more about him than it does about you (and it doesn’t say anything good!). But your feelings are valid and I’m sorry he’s being a jerk, you deserve better whether you can hear or not

We hearing folks even have trouble understanding someone with their mouth full, so IDK what your dad thinks HAs would have done! Maybe remind him of just that (if he's hearing, he has to know)?

I feel sometimes someone cannot comprehend their own tactless behaviour. My own father repeatedly told me that he once knew someone who could turn their hearing aids up, why can‘t I? I couldn‘t understand his mumbling, but this clearly went over his head, so I just had to let bygones be bygones cause I love my father too much to die on this hill. 
My advice: yes it was tactless of him but he might never understand you POV. Don’t invest too much energy in this.

My family was like that. I just stopped visiting them.

That's so annoying &amp; rude. Even with my Aides in I can't understand people sometimes. Has nothing to do with volume. I always take mine out when I'm home to get a break from sound fatigue.

He is wrong. Hearing aids make things louder but that means jumbled up sound from food in mouth becomes louder ju bled up sounds.

What HOH hearing aid using person has not-at least once- heard this rude,uneducated comment? I’ve dealt with this many times since I was 5 years old. I’m middle age now. And guess what these people need to know still? Yep- we still have to explain that hearing aids are not some kind of panacea or miracle device for HOH people. Despite many decades since I was diagnosed, they still do not give you natural hearing.

My ent told my parents when I was diagnosed at r yrs old to let me decide when and when not to wear them. They were uncomfortable,didn’t improve anything but make the volume of EVERYTHING EQUALLY LOUD.  It was mentally and physically draining.  I don’t feel the onus is on us. You have the prerogative to wear aids or not.  
And if people have something important they want you to hear-they can stand facing you ,in a close vicinity,speak up and allow you to read their lips. I got mainstreamed in school. Hearing aids in that environment did not work efficiently. Not to mention the bullying. My family? Guilty of never meeting me half way. As in starting conversations at a distance-or not facing me.   

They treated me like I was not hearing impaired. Which was annoying. Only one person understood my situation-my father. And when his hearing got bad,he bought a pair of aids and then he totally got my complaints about hearing aids not replicating natural hearing.

Same.  I think there's a thing where people think they're dealing with an idiot if they have to repeat themselves more than twice.

Ignorant people tend to be impatient with the differently abled.

yes. The same thing has happened to me from a former ""friend."" It's fucked up because it's essentially saying ""I don't want to deal with your disability and you're making it a little bit more difficult for me so go run and get your disability aid so your disability is less inconvenient.""

You’re not alone. My parents get snappy when I don’t put my processor on. It’s hurtful! I need breaks from hearing. He’s being very rude ☹️

That was rude and considering it is your father you owe them nothing but they owe you the right of communication. He should be the one to learn or pursue correct communication.

Talking with your mouth full is 10/10 rude.
Talking with your mouth full and asking someone to use their hearing aids is 10/10 rude.
However, if he had done everything himself so that you could understand him better, it would only be 1/10 rude.
Communication is a two-player game; it's no fun if only one person does all the work.
If something like this happens again, I would use the TTS (text-to-speech) function on my smartphone.
If there are only garbled words, it means that not even a smartphone can understand my father.
By the way, would you use the TTS function on your smartphone to communicate better with your father?

I have to tell my son that mumbling at me even when I do have my HAs in isn't any easier than when I don't have them in.

If this was a ""Am I the AH?"" post, I'd say no. Your dad is.

Plus, it's hella rude to talk with your mouth full. We don't need to see food coming out while someone tries to communicate. It's not a sea food restaurant.

Are you able to stay with friend or anything if this a visit from college or are you finished with college and only home bc there isn't a place to go? Hopefully that doesn't seem mean to ask. Just, its be better for your mental health to not deal with family that doesn't get it.

Yes, it’s rude. My boss did this to me ONCE and I never forgot it.

He shouldn’t be talking to you with his mouth full regardless. Even with both my hearing aids in and turned up full I need to lip read, which I can’t do when someone is eating. 

He’s your father, he should have figured out how to communicate with you with or without your hearing aids in tbh.

It’s totally rude and insulting. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, I feel small and scolded, and I’m 20 years older than you. Part of that is my own stuff, and part of that is the person being completely inappropriate. 

I think it ties back to the ignorant association between deaf and dumb. In the moment, the hearing person is saying to the D/HOH person, “Hey Dummy, put in your hearing aids so you can join me up here at my level where normal people live.”

It is also them telling you what to do with your body, even if you have listening fatigue, an ear infection, or no reason at all. They’re saying, “I need you to do this with your body because it will make me feel better.”

It’s no one’s business whether you wear them or not. I will often let the person I’m spending time with know up front if I’m not wearing them, saying lip reading is extra important in that moment. If it continues to be a struggle, I’ll jokingly but firmly say, “You can chew or I can hear what you have to say. Up to you.”

One last thing: If the speaker demonstrates any frustration at my struggle to hear, I gently remind them that it’s way more frustrating for me not to hear than for them to have to repeat.

Bottom line: You felt hurt because it was hurtful.

(Side note: Your dad’s aggressive reaction sounds like you triggered a shame response from him. That’s his issue, not yours. But if you do want to avoid it in the future there are ways you can phrase your need to minimize him taking it personally. Again, not your problem, but could help to elicit a more compassionate response on his end. BIG maybe for a dude I don’t know.)

Yes, it's rude and disrespectful. It's not your fault being Deaf so why he gotta make you feel bad for not being able to hear. Why don't he learn how to use signs or gestures? That way he can still communicate while his mouth is full! 🙄

I'm usually offended when that happens because like... do you even understand how hearing aids work? The answer is usually no, and even when I explain it people still tell me to put them in.

It sounds like your dad was frustrated.
No, he wasn't nice... Ask him to please be patient with you.

[deleted]

Rudeness aside, how does your dad expect to be understood if you aren’t wearing your heating aids when he’s talking to you.
How do you expect to know what people are saying to you if you aren’t wearing your aids?

I’m on the fence here. 

Maybe it’s on you to be polite here, you should wear your aids when sitting at the table with others.
It’s on you to wear your aids so that people can communicate with you. 

And yes, I’m also profoundly deaf and wear aids too.

Father - don’t talk whilst eating. Gross and bad manners. 

OP - wear hearing aids. Trust me, it’ll make life easier. 

Issue solved. 

And NO I am NOT being “audist”, before anyone jumps on me.

I’m profoundly deaf,  wear hearing aids and rely on lipreading. So - yes - I know exactly what I’m talking about and I am speaking from experience.  The aids support my lipreading to no end. I wear them pretty much all the time everywhere.

no its not rude, we live in a hearing world and  its highly frustrating and limiting to not be able to communicate effectively with as  many people as possible. maybe it was aggressive, but you gotta try and see i t from other peoples' perspectives, if you could hear and were really trying to tell someone important that could not hear, but can with hearing aids, youd likely get frustrated. maybe ask him to try and be a bit nicer about it, but other than that,  no,   we live in a hearing world,  most animals can hear to varying degrees. most animals rely on their hearing  to varying degrees, so its not rude and its not unreasonable to want and expect to be able to communicate as effectively as possible to all people.

Very rude i have been a few times at work i need to turn mine up

Haha, my spouse doesn't put his in until it's time for work. The only drama is my Mum encountering him in the kitchen one very early morning, and him saying ""aids out, can't hear you"" and sailing by with his bathrobe dramatically flapping around his knees and her just standing there saying nothing waiting for the coffee to start.🤣🤣🤣

It's like people not wearing their glasses, tbh. We don't expect that 24/7, why should we expect hearing aids?

Very rude and hurtful. Fuck him.

Nobody has the ability to hurt your feelings like family

Yes absolutely

When my boyfriend says “maybe you should put your ears on” (I call my CI’s my ears) I just say “ NO ONE tells me when to put my ears in!” Thankfully, I’ve only had to say this once.

Wowee, understandable about your circumstances with your father, he is only asking you to put your hearing aids on because he is feeling frustrated that you won't be able to understand him, but you can explain it to him look I have just woke him no needs to wear my hearing aids please let me unwind and to eat my breakfast! He will understand it from you he might says to you ok I got! But if you go out with other people who would say to you put your hearing aids that is very rude not very polite ways, not very nice ok

Hmm, back home? Why? He might have been content without you. Hence the stark reaction. Time to move onward, so elder abuse doesn’t happen to you. Being a sensitive soul that you are.",2025-07-26 10:49:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m9qc9i/is_it_rude_when_someone_tells_you_to_put_your/

1m8jny4,deaf,Interpreting services for private healthcare (BC),"Hey all, 

  
I work reception at a private clinic (Naturopathic doctors, chiropractic etc) in BC Canada. I recently had someone call and ask for interpreting services for their child's appointment (CODA). This person told me that it is our responsibility to provide an interpreter. 

  
I phoned provincial language services and they could not help me because we are a private clinic. They told me it is the patient's responsibility to have an interpreter when necessary. I told this to the person inquiring but they were still adamant that we should pay for the interpreter. I ultimately am very sympathetic and told the person that I would look into it, but I really just work here and don't have any real authority. 

  
This person's appointment is too soon for us to source an interpreter, but I want input on how to handle this in the future. I want to be a good ally to the Deaf/HoH community. There are no resources for us to access interpreters and it seems that we have to hire one privately, although *legally* it is the patient's responsibility to do so. 

  
Is it unreasonable for us to expect people to bring their own interpreter when required? I wish there was some kind of resource we could access, and it's really just not my call to hire an interpreter. 

  
Thanks in advance for any input.

Perhaps your employer should ask a lawyer so they get a definitive answer as to what the law is.  It's not your job as an admin person who just works there.

Anyway.  I think the patient is right?  BC Human Rights Code probably applies here.  Creates a general duty to accommodate including for sign language interpretation.  In the medical context that means you hire the interpreter for them.  You should have a budget available for these things as needed.  If your employer doesn't that's... well see my first paragraph.  Your employer should make sure they know the law.  

Have you spoken to the doctor they are seeing?  Like do they know?  What does the the doctor expect to happen when their patient who only knows ASL shows up?  How do they plan to communicate?

Ask your workplace’s legal counsel to understand and interpret the law. 

It is worth it as a small business open to the public to have a small monthly automatic transfer into a budget/savings account for accessibility requests. It’s easier to save 1/4th of an hour of an interpreters rate/Braille printer’s fees/etc, regularly, than absorb a sudden request to spend all that money at once. 

Once you have a healthy amount of funds in there, you can slow the monthly contributions and free up that line item for elsewhere in your budget. 

At the end of the day, you want the best outcome for your patients. A patient’s caregiver and their home observations are valuable and are worth accommodating. You probably want to get a full history, and the parent is worth hearing from. You want the patient to follow your care instructions, and their caregiver/parent is your best ally in this. They can best do that if they understand clearly what to do, so it is in the best interests for the medical professionals to make sure they have quality access solutions ready.

You likely have a duty to accommodate. https://www.stillinterpreting.com/duty-to-accommodate

The bar for undue hardship is pretty high. You may want to reach out to bc human rights, but realistically you would be turning someone away because of their disability. 

You really don’t want parent 1 interpreting for parent 2. Just from a legal protection standpoint, if they interpret incorrectly and end up having parent 2 not actually understand what they are agreeing to you open yourself up to potential ramifications. 

While you can probably ask the deaf person for assistance in finding an interpreter service if it’s not obvious, the arrangements and cost would be on your business, it’s just the cost of doing business like anything else.  It’s also likely tax deductible but you should discuss with the company’s accountant.

Peeling an orange.  It makes a faint ripping noise similar to paper.

Speaking of which: paper.  It makes *so* much noise.  Folding it, tearing it, just shaking or moving it produces noise.

Apparently fox screams sound like human ones. I wouldn't know as they scream at night at which point I've usually taken off my hearing aids to go to bed.

POS machines. I was out shopping with a friend and when I tapped my card to pay I held it in the machine for a few seconds (cuz some machines take a bit longer) and my friend said ""you can take it off, it beeped"" and I was like uhhh they beep??  

My friend knew that I'm HoH but she said she didn't realize the extent until that day. The cashier thought it was hilarious lol

I'm the only deaf person in my family, which includes a sister who has ears like... a bat. I suspect she has a slight touch of [misophonia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia). 

Anyway... with a family like mine, it was basically ingrained in me that **everything makes noise**. 

People's clothes rustle when they walk. Shoes squeak on certain surfaces. [Plants actively growing make noise.](https://www.cnn.com/cnn/2023/03/30/world/plants-make-sounds-scn) Heck... even *breathing* makes noise. 

*EVERYTHING* MAKES NOISE.

Edit: [corrected link to article about plants making noise](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/30/world/plants-make-sounds-scn)

Wind.  Are you kidding me? Yep,  Wind.

trees! i walked outside for the first time wearing hearing aids, i had no idea that leaves in the wind made a sound, i thought it was static until i got in my car and the sound stopped haha

Before I put on hearing aids, I never knew air conditioners made noise. *Even after hearing aids I still didn't get why I heard air in rooms :')*

I worked for a restaurant that had a shaved ice machine, the motor for it was in the ceiling and the ice fell into a bin below. I stunned other employees by asking if it made noise, they could hear a loud noise and the room was silent to me. They all seemed shocked that I could hear them but not that motor.

Writing, like with a pen/pencil on paper lol.

I’m on the milder side of being HoH but I was shocked when I found out that your breathing makes sounds.

I cannot hear car engines, computer fans (at normal capacity), and water running without my hearing aids

You can hear the water moving through the pipes in your house (sometimes). I rarely hear it, but when it’s quiet enough and I do, it freaks me out.

Also, I thought waterslides would have more of a sound, but apparently it’s JUST water.

I learned pretty fast early on as a young little kid that anything that makes vibrations makes noise. Wind, on the other hand, was a very new one to me. I thought my hearing aids were malfunctioning when it first caught a lot of wind out here in ND, and I had to be told that was just the wind.

Misting systems for greenhouses and plants make a noise, as well as hand sprayers. I was only able to hear it after I got my last pair of HA. It took me a while to figure that out, and even then, I only learnt because I asked my mom out of frustration ""what the heck is doing that annoying noise?"".

My niece said her bra was squeeking. Blew my mind. I also didn't realise people can hear you use the toilet.

Hm, I was raised by a hearing family and I have a CI so I've been pretty aware of noises. 

I do remember learning that air made noise at some point as a kid. 

I also remember learning that I have heavy footsteps in a house that creaked a lot and had thin walls. 

We had a pretty beat up old van, growing up, that would apparently squeal at such a high pitched frequency my CI wasnt able to pick it up. Either the channels were turned off or my electrodes just don't go that far since I have ossification in my ears. Attempts to get the car fixed were made but seemingly fruitless.

I didn't know bubbles popping made noise. Hair swishing. Dogs scratching their necks (collars)...some clocks tick, to name a few...

I didn’t realize cars made noise, I thought they just vibrated. I’ve been struggling to tell when my damn car is off or on ^^;

When I got a newer model of hearing aids I discovered that skin makes a sound.. it's horrific. I've never heard skin ever before in my entire life, now I hear it all the time.. I'll never be able to go back

HoH, when I got my hearing aids I couldn’t wear them in the car. I had no idea tires on the road made so much noise! It hurt my head so much. Instant headache.

Boiling water.  I searched everywhere for the noise.  Then went to stir something and found it.

Paintbrushes. I had no idea they made sound when used on canvas, etc.

I didn’t know my PS4 made a beeping sound when it turned on. Also crickets, I didn’t realize there were so many of them where I live and that they were that loud. Guess I should thank my CI.

The different sounds of water.  The ocean is calming, but a faucet and flushing toilet is among the most annoying sounds ever.  I remove the cochlear magnet from my head during those times.

Writing. I usually write without HA and only recently wrote with my fountain pen with them in and realized its actually so loud

Door creaking

The dishwasher and freezer drove me bonkers at first, looked all around for the noise and my mom had to point out they just Do That

the fridge

the fridge buzzs and I still can't hear it

Stars.

Gas burners make a ticking sound when you turn them on!

As a hearing person who has spent her life around music and singing, being with a Deaf partner is such a special thing :) some of my favorite conversations with him are regarding sound or music. 

He asked me one time if everyone’s voices sound the same, and I thought that was so interesting cause NOT AT ALL! 

Also trying my keyboard and guessing that the left side was playing higher notes because the vibration was stronger/the right side was playing lower notes because the vibration wasn’t as strong.

Okay so this one is funny. Please forgive me when I say that for the longest time my oldest said her sister (autistic level 2) was noisy when she was just sitting there being herself. I knew my middle (both my girls are the oldest of their brother and the middle is the second autistic one, the other sister is also autistic but not the same as her younger sister) could talk loudly and has breathing issue when eating. I didn't  realize she was loud in other ways. I'd take her to an ENT but the ones around here are horrible. Anyway, I get my HAs and one day as I'm just crocheting, I realize my middle child is a loud breather. I looked at my oldest and say, ""Holy crap, I thought that your dislike for loud chewers and sensitivity to sound was why you said your sister is noisy. But I can hear her from here."" My oldest laughed and asked if I'd heard her sister before. ""Well, not like that!""

Lol I couldn't hear it before the HAs.

I found out that bird feet make pitter patter noises on the grass when I got my hearing aids.

Shortly after I got my hearing aids (almost two years ago), we were in a big box hardware store, talking to an employee about a part we needed for something. Suddenly, there was this loud hissing, or low roaring. Neither my husband or the employee reacted but I was looking around like a startled magpie and then blurted out: ""Holy sh\*t! Is that rain?"" 

My husband chuckled and the employee replied, confused: ""Ye...es?"" 

I laughed and said: ""I just got hearing aids. I didn't know you could hear the rain in big building.""

When I was finally able to get hearing aides a decade ago, I learned chairs make sound on carpet, water makes noise in sewers, refrigerators hum, microwaves make noise, what doorbells sound like. Just a few I remembered

I never realized how many sounds a dishwasher has. Ours plays a little song when the power is turned on. I didn't hear it until my CI was activated 4 weeks ago. I still have to put my hand on it to feel if it is running.

Pages turning in books. When I first got my hearing aids, I got scared because I had no idea what the noise I was hearing was.

Flies 🪰 . I never knew until my hearing brother complained about it when it was ""stuck"" in the room. I was liike really????? Then one day, a fly happened to land right behind my hearing aid 🦻 I was shook 😳

Bicycles! I thought my partner was psychic because she knows when a bicycle is coming up behind us, turns out she can just hear. I'm not sure exactly which part of a bike makes a noise.

Dog collars! Apparently sometimes they tinkle or sound like a bell or something.

Breathing! Ew. Your own breath too how annoying must that be.

Birds! In such unlikely places too like streets with hedges or a couple of trees might have lots of bird song, not just forests where you would expect it. 

Last but not least... your nose can whistle, randomly.",2025-07-24 23:23:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m8jlaa/what_makes_sound_that_you_never_realised_made/

1m8hb1m,deaf,Gallaudet Protest Documentary,"I am desperate, I took ASL in high school and remember watching a documentary about the Deaf Presidnet Now protests then (approximately 2016 to 2018). I have also just seen the newer Apple TV documentary and wanted to watch the previous one since I dont have access to apple TV.

 I can not find anything about a previous documentary though. I have found a few long youtube videos but nothing about an actual documentary. Is the Apple TV film the first or is it just dominating search results because it is new?
I accept that I may just be remembering youtube videos that I was shown as part of a lesson, it has been a while. Any information or recommendations are appreciated. 

[댓글]
I believe there were two other documentaries that covered it, one named “Life Worth Living” (2011) and of course “Through Deaf Eyes” (2007).
If you remember any names, people featured in it, or what platform it was on, add them here and it may help finding it.

It could have also been apart of an academic library, I can check if it’s possibly in DCMP (described and captioned media program).

It might be worth emailing the teacher or institution that showed it ☻

Is it the [Deaf Mosaic #402](https://youtu.be/OtsYVeRuBuw) one? It's from 1988 so pretty much definitely the first one.

1m85iua,deaf,Unable to do career,"Has anyone else experienced suddenly being unable to do their career due to new deafness? 

I have always been deaf in one ear since birth, but in the last year developed severe hearing loss in the other (identify as Deaf now). 

I have worked as a paramedic for 911 ambulances for the last 6-7 years, since I was 18. It’s been a passion and huge point of identity for me my whole adult life. I just graduated with a Neuroscience degree, as I knew it’s a tough career in your mind and body so I wanted to plan to shift in the next few years. 

But I expected to be able to make that decision on my own, and when I basically lost my hearing overnight, I had to suddenly stop working. Due to other health issues I have not returned to work since but am starting to look for a job out of necessity. 

I feel so deflated looking for jobs that are at a lower level of responsibility/impact than what I’ve done before, because it feels like I’m suddenly not capable. (Not saying my job was the more important than other people’s, it just held value for me). 

Has anyone else had a similar experience, and how did you reframe your identity or feeling about work to empower yourself to move forward? Thanks! 

[댓글]
What did you plan to do with your neuroscience degree and what's stoping you doing that now?

I.e. was it going to require a step down anyway to get your foot in the door in which case all you're doing is making that move sooner and giving yourself more time at the top of that new career in the long run, which would make you better off.

In the meantime are there any short term roles you could do within your paramedic service to keep money coming in until you start your new career. For example, internal training to other paramedics, auditing records etc?

Are you proficient in ASL? There are so many people who would appreciate an EMT/medical professional who speaks ASL! And an ASL speaker in neuroscience would be invaluable!

Why would deafness cause a change? There are plenty of deaf doctors, lab technicians, researchers etc.

I was an english teacher, and planned to continue working until my legs couldn't manaage to get me to class.

But I suffered sudden hearing loss in 2019 and struggled to hear my students, even with hearing aids..Then Covid hit, which finished it off for me. By the time Covid had passed, my hearing had deteriorated even more.

So I had to to take early retirement, not out of choice, but because of the realities.

I haven't found it easy giving up teaching, as I loved my job. But I have always had a passion for writing, so that's what keeps me busy and occupied now.

Yes, if not for my hearing loss, I would still be teaching. But I always believe in moving forward in life, no matter what it brings. So I do.

I suddenly lost my hearing in both ears. I wear cochlear implants but can understand only 60% of speech in noise. I’m a teacher. I made it through or year as a 6th grade teacher but I’m going to start teaching kindergarten soon. I’m very worried I’m going to lose my job. I don’t know what I’ll do then.

Take a moment to adjust. You will find new ways to adapt and accommodate. I know it’s hard when you’ve had hearing and then you’ve lost it. It is a loss. But people like me have been deaf our whole lives and have careers because we don’t know any other way. So trust me, there is a way. You’re allowed to take some time off and regroup and re-evaluate. But you’re still capable.

I am in the same path as you worked as a industrial electro mechanic for 20+ years, always been hard of hearing since birth and now deaf the past few years which made it near impossible to hear the walkie talkie radio. I been repairing and troubleshooting all type of automation equipment in food manufacturing and in warehousing. Has someone has said to me you can’t be forced to take   A lower paying position or minimum wage job because of our disability. They will either need to find a way for you to be able to do your job. Has for me 1 deaf technician vs 100s they will find a way to get you to take a early retirement. Wish I can teach future generations of students how to understand robotics and automation but with no hearing I would be limiting myself.

Mine has changed paths previously I wanted to be a manager in my store now I'd like to work in a school  for the deaf even if it's just as hired help.

I have an echo core stethoscope and it connects to my phone Bluetooth but since I have implant and hearing aids in and they connect to my phone so all audio on my phone plays in my ear basically allowing me to listen to my stethoscope through Bluetooth

My hearing went down after college and I wore hearing aids after that. I lost my hearing completely last year overnight as well. I used voice to text to get by and then got a cochlear implant. Have you gone to an ENT? I recommend going to an ER (ENT told me it would take too long to through insurance).  I recommend being around family right now that can help you.

You’re definitely not incapable. You have a specific set of skills that can be just as important as the job you’ve been doing up to now. I feel for you, you’ll be grieving your work and satisfaction of helping people. You can still apply those skills, it’ll just have to be another way unfortunately. You will eventually get back, that job satisfaction that you crave and deserve. I’ve been profoundly deaf since very young, both ears so my career had to be tailored from the start. I would have loved to do your job, so credit to you for pulling it off to this point. Take time to reset and rethink, you will be successful again.

I had a severe to profound hearing loss from age 12 due to measles, long story short at age 50 I incurred more hearing loss. I got a Cochlear implant, it saved my job and made a big difference. You should look into it.",2025-07-24 14:13:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m85iua/unable_to_do_career/

I would say slightly depends on where in the world you are. I myself am in Canada and im usually excited when hearing people try to sign / be friendly.

1m7m5dl,deaf,Video chatting with a deaf coworker,"Started a new job in a remote setting, so the vast majority of communications are via Slack, email or Google Meet.

A new colleague of mine is deaf, amongst a company full of hearing folks. He is extremely accommodating when speaking - spelling out acronyms, slowing down his pace, checking in to ensure I understand, etc.

I’ve had very little exposure to deaf/HOH speech and I’m struggling to understand him, even with more focused listening. Google’s live captioning struggles to pick up his speech patterns.

Is it just a matter of getting exposure to understand his speech patterns? Would picking up basic ASL terminology help to equip him with another tool to communicate? Any other tips to ensure I understand him better?

Ask him. He knows what works best for him.


If there is a chat option, ask him whether using it would make it easier to communicate.

As a Deaf person, ask him and whether he’s comfortable to utilize company ADA accommodations. 

Legally, especially if the company is large with over certain # of employees; HR/company *is* obligated to provide access. It can look many different ways but there’s captioned reel, captel phone, video relay but use VCO (voice carry over meaning it allows deaf user to use their own voice) or/and interpreters for team and large meetings.

He’s video chatting you on the assumption that he sign or lip read you. If that simply isn’t something you’re comfortable with yet, just ask him what would work best for the both of y’all. It sounds like he’s extremely accommodating.

ASL has a weird structure compared to English, so that might be the cause if the issue is the structure. 

If it's the first one, he probably just doesn't speak properly. ""Deaf accent"" is a thing for some people, because they never heard themselves speaking to adjust/correct their speech and never had good/any speech therapy. If someone lost their hearing later in life, this usually isn't a thing, because they learned to speak before they lost the ability to adjust it.",2025-07-23 21:41:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m7m5dl/video_chatting_with_a_deaf_coworker/

1m6rhq8,deaf,Sign Names and Deaf Elderly with Other Disabilities,"I tried being as descriptive and consice with the title.

I am HoH and recently had to transition my middle child to a place for adults with disabilities bc her current advocacy place is having to shut down. Very long story behind that bc its unfortunate given what happened before now. And as I was taking a tour with a head of the facility, filling out paperwork and heading out with my oldest (my middle was with her current tech and left to go shopping), a few of the older adult members were excited to meet us. One is an elderly Deaf lady with other needs, of which I'm not sure what all together but she did seem to be of a younger mindset, happily said hi and shooke our hands. The head of the facility signed my daughters name. I didn't see mine signed but then again another member did say as well. So many were happy to meet us. And I was wondering, aside from seeing my daughters name signed (it's three letters), how do sign names work? I'd be happy to sign mine since I most likely will see this lady a lot in the future. Are sign names given by the signer that is Deaf? And are there different ways to sign a name or is it based on something? My name is a bit long but I can go by a shorter nickname if need be. It's one I am not fond of but I think in this case I'm fine with it. I hope this is an okay question.

Edit to add: Oh and I am in the US.

I'm in the UK but what I know of ASL it's much the same. Sign names are given by deaf signers, yes. And it's usually incorporates a characteristic that stands out or something about their personality. 
For example our daughters sign name is her first letter and a smile, a deaf friend is infamous for her lack of balance so her first letter turns into a fall. My partner got blue hands while adding his handprint to our deaf club family tree, so his is his initial while signing blue.
As far as I'm aware and what I've seen of deaf/CODA's I follow online in the US, it's a similar way of naming people there too.

u/FrostyAgency5967 gave a great perspective on this!

I’d just like to verify as a Deaf person from the US who uses ASL.

Sign names are given by Deaf individuals, preferably by those who are fluent and involved in the community. 

It’s perfectly fine to fingerspell your name or shorten your name into a nickname. 

Sign names are different from fingerspelling, and typically represent the person by combining a sign and the letter of their first name - this varies.

For example, “Jennifer” becomes J or J-E-N, or in a variation of a sign name J 
combined with a motion of curly hair. 

It’s also normal to use initials, or point if you’re in person. Sign names are typically only needed if you’re interacting with the Deaf community frequently, where you’ll be in group settings or need to refer to a person when they’re not in the room. 

Hope this helps! ☻

I'm in Australia but what I've seen is that sign names work the same or similar here like the USA. Sometimes a Deaf person gives a person a sign name, it's not considered appropriate for you to give yourself one or ask for one, stuff like that (and can end badly as one person I know gave herself a sign name that she thought meant smile but it meant lesbian). I have a very common name and grew up with a nickname that I prefer over my sign name generally but I will sign my sign name if people ask if I have one. My nickname is only three letters so it's easy to fingerspell. I don't mind having a sign name but I have used the same nickname for years so it's just my preference. 

Also generally there is no need to use someone's sign name when they are present and it's what you get referred to when you're not around. I just point or wave at someone who is present rather than fingerspell or sign their name. I do see it used online though if there is a group and you want to get someone's attention but otherwise I don't see sign names used to get attention so people only seem to use mine when I'm present when I'm on zoom/video chat in a group. And due to my name being common before I had a sign name I got my initials fingerspelled a lot to distinguish me from other people with the same name. And people with long names got a few letters fingerspelled rather than full name too.",2025-07-22 21:58:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m6rhq8/sign_names_and_deaf_elderly_with_other/
1m6lnqq,deaf,After not wanting to wear hearing aids as I feel like they don’t do much for me.. Was I suppose to get a mould with them to fit into my ears?,"

[댓글]
There are types of hearing aids with different molds.

This is an issue you should raise with your audiologist. Keep giving feedback regularly so they can figure it out what works best for you.

Moulds help a little, but overall new hearing aids do take a couple months to get used to. Also, if you got the OTC ones, they do suck

Depends on the type of hearing aid. My mom and father in law have hearing aids like this with the little plug type thing.  My hearing aids are super strong and need a full ear mold to prevent feedback.  

My mom has had her hearing aid for 3+ years and still complains about it.  It’s a different sound quality than natural hearing.

Custom molds do help a bit. Personally, it felt like maybe a 10-20% improvement.

At a certain point though, hearing aids do start to not be very effective anymore. Some people decide to stick with them, some people go full deaf all the time, and some people go CI. Personally, big fan of option 3.

I prefer custom molds as the rubber domes irritate my ears and cause itchiness.  Custom molds also don’t fall out and I forget I have them on half the time.  Totally worth investigating.

I'm not a fan of those. I feel bad for folks being given those styles without other options as I don't feel they're as durable. Maybe see if you can get some with a mold.

It depends on the type of hearing aid you have my best advice is to talk to your audiologist as they are going to be more familiar with how yours works and if you need an ear mold. [Examples of types of hearing for reference](https://www.centreforhearing.org/wiki/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Understanding-the-Types-of-Hearing-Aid.jpg) Some hearing aid don’t require needing an ear mold.

I have severe hearing loss and able to wear RICs with custom made ear molds. I have seen folks who have the RICs with the dome style either hate them or tolerate them. As others have said, talk with your audiologist about what your options are.

Okay, here’s a thing that happens, especially to people who don’t want to wear HA. It’s common for a person new to HA to freak out with all the new sound coming in, and it takes a month at least for your brain to learn how to filter the extra sound, so a lot of audiologists set them low for the first time user, expecting to crank it up the next time you come in. This avoids the “too much sound” panic. 

But…setting it too low means that the HA don’t actually help you understand conversations. Go talk to your audiologist and see about tweaking the setting. Don’t give up on the HA yet. 

And to answer your question about the molded earpiece…those tend to be for more severe hearing loss and can be uncomfortable/annoying until you’re more used to the whole HA experience. Stick with the domes and get the levels adjusted is my advice.

Did you seriously not ask your audiologist this before you left their office with new hearing aids? 

The little thingy that goes into your ear is called a dome. You usually see them with receiver in canal type hearing aids but that doesn't seem to be what you have.   

If you'd rather have a custom mold for your ear you can certainly get one, but why was this not discussed when you were fitted with the hearing aid? 

If you're not getting results from your hearing aids any more then don't wear them.  I never got good results from hearing aids.

What did you audiologist order?

No I think the ones you have are way more comfortable. I wear that kind.

That's something you and your audiologist can discuss, as different domes and molds may change the effectiveness of the hearing aids depending on your specific needs and your ear canal shape.

I've also used my HAs a little less lately, don't need them most the time at work, and lately with my neck issues they cause my ear canals to hurt more easily (probably changes the shape with swelling etc). But I'm also re-learning ASL to keep up some form of communication.

I didn't get molds until my 3rd pair. But it depends on the brand you order, my Phonaks are very expensive with custom molds. You have to specifically order molds.

You CAN, it's not required. I've always had custom molds.",2025-07-22 18:16:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m6lnqq/after_not_wanting_to_wear_hearing_aids_as_i_feel/
1m6d0q2,deaf,Question regarding gaming,"Hi, hope you’re all doing well 🙏🏼
I’m a female gamer and I’ve been playing solo games for a long time. Recently, I’ve decided to broaden my repertoire and try multiplayer games.

The thing is, I’m deaf and never really used a headset. I recently got a cochlear implant on my right ear only, so I have a few questions:
	•	For deaf or hard-of-hearing gamers: do you play multiplayer games?
	•	If so, how do you manage voice chat, especially when multiple voices overlap?
	•	Do you use any tools or devices that help?
	•	Any headset recommendations for deaf players (with or without implants)?

Also, if you have any game recommendations, feel free to share, I’d love to discover new ones 

Thanks in advance 🎮💜

I'm deaf and use voice chat. I typically wait until I have a few friends and their friends available to play because they know me and are willing to do their best to talk one at a time. I turn off any unnecessary game sound so I can focus hard on what's being said. I can't really hear them even at full volume using computer speakers so I use headphones with really big ear pieces to leave room for my hearing aids then I am able to understand better.

I play multiplayer sometimes. I don't do voice chat. I don't do headphones. I use the ingame chat.
If you want to play the competitive kind of multiplayer games, I think there are deaf guilds around.

same here! i’m a female gamer with mainly solo games but i play multiplayer sometimes. i don’t really use voice chat honestly because there’s too much to chance that i won’t understand the person on vc. i like marvel rivals cuz there is an easier break time to type out your message in between rounds and respawns. i used to play dead by daylight all the time cuz of the added visual indicator they did for survivors (but none for being killer 🙃) fortnite is pretty good to play with vc sometimes if you’re doing duos or trios which lessen the amount of voices overlapping. unfortunately the voice overlapping thing is never gonna go away unless they’re aware you’re deaf personally and they know you.

So some cheat tricks your CI should be bluetooth enabled can pair it with the PC.   
I have also used windows live caption on a second monitor at times. (CTRL + WIN +L you may need to install a language pack) but i dont play a lot of games with voice

I avoid voice comms like the plague. I do play some multiplayer games, but it really depends on the community. Some gaming communities are absolute assholes about voice comms. Others are cool with just using text chat. If you can hear well enough to use voice, more power to you.  
As for recommendations, I play Helldivers 2. Playing with other PC only players (no cross play with console players) means most everyone has a keyboard. Text chat is almost standard. Very rarely do I run into trouble with people demanding voice comms. Not to mention... In the game you're a little too busy getting blown up repeatedly to bother chatting anyway.

I just finished playing a game called Gris and I LOVED it. You should totally check it out. It’s a slow-paced puzzle game with stunning visuals; if you partake🍃🍃 I would recommend trying it after a sesh!

I am inclined to single player games with subtitles even though I have bone conduction headphone . Multiplayer such a way I can't have most fun out of it because being HoH i like isolation better.

one of my favourite games is dead by daylight. while a lot of queues in that game are largely auditory, they do have features like a visual heartbeat to tell you when to start running. take a look thru the accessibility settings in the games you own, i do that from time to time and im almost always pleased with what i find.",2025-07-22 12:40:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m6d0q2/question_regarding_gaming/
1m68otv,deaf,Deaf travel – Eurostar reduced fare?,"Hi! I’m DHH (not EU resident, but a EU student). I’m planning to travel alone with Eurostar in August.

I saw that Eurostar gives reduced prices for wheelchair users, but I found a FAQ saying that deaf or blind travellers have to pay full price, and only their companion can get a discount. This confused me a lot — I’m travelling alone, and i am not sure if I can buy a ticket for ""wheelchair user"".

I tried to contact Eurostar through their website yesterday and today, but the page just keeps loading and I’m not sure if my message was sent (and of course, I don’t want to call them!).

Has anyone had a similar experience? Does anyone know if solo deaf travellers can get a reduced ticket on Eurostar? Thanks very much!

[댓글]
The wheelchair discount is because the seat quality of premium doesn’t apply to someone staying in their own wheelchair (so they get the standard fare). The companion discount is to help balance out the cost of having a companion needed (if you’re unable to travel solo, like many disabled people are). So, solo travelers regardless of disability wouldn’t be offered a discount, as they have no need for a companion’s assistance. 

If you have a European disability card, maybe there are other discounts? Some transit companies in my country have that option for people past a certain percent (although independent Deaf people don’t always qualify as 33% or more disability). Granted you might have to be a full resident to qualify for this sort of card. 

Hope this helps clarify!

I have booked a Eurostar ticket recently and to be honest, I never expected them to reduce their prices for blind and deaf travellers. 

At least in Germany it's common to be able to travel with my disability ID card for free only using the regional trains. If I want to use the long distance trains, I pay the same price like everyone else. Companions get free ride as long as it's stated on the disability ID card.

[removed]

In the UK deaf people are eligible for a disability railcard that gives 1/3 off rail fares, plus 1/3 off the fare of a companion, plus a few other minor bonuses. 

It’s not free, it has to be paid for. But if you travel more than a couple of times a year you save more than the cost of the card. However, it doesn’t cover Eurostar.",2025-07-22 08:34:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m68otv/deaf_travel_eurostar_reduced_fare/
1m5ogqu,deaf,Learning sign language as an Indian who doesn’t have hearing issues,"I’m a 23 yo from India. Recently I am thinking of learning sign language. However, I don’t have any friends who are hearing impaired, I asked one and they use hearing aid and doesn’t have much idea about sign language. My question is to fellow Indians here is - which sign language is mainly used in India, and where can I learn it from. 

Also, since ASL has much resources to
learn from, if I learn that - could people who use a different be able to communicate using that language? 

Apologies if I have sounded bad in any sense, I have been amused by the way sign languages work and want to learn it for fun plus I could converse with those with hearing issues.

&gt;Also, since ASL has much resources to learn from, if I learn that - could people who use a different be able to communicate using that language?

This question has a complicated answer.

Simple answer; No they are different languages.

Complicated answer; people with different sign languages, especially if they are Deaf, often find away round barriers like this. They find compromises and in-betweens - and focus on more visual signing. Also, ASL has influenced Indian Sign language. However British Sign Language has been a far bigger impact on Indian Sign Language for obvious historical reasons - to the point where I for one find that BSL is more or less mutually intelligible with Indian Sign Language.

That was a funny scene on “One More Time” this customer kept trying to sign to DJ but he wears hearing aids and doesn’t know ASL

If you are based in NCR in India, then you might want to reach out to ISLRTC. That's a department within one of the ministries tasked to enrich the ISL vocabulary and promote its usage. They also conduct ISL training, although for interpretors.

TBH, this is a question best posed to his audiologist. There are many HA brands out there, and audiologists can narrow it down to ones best suited for his specific hearing loss.

There are many factors that go into what is ""best"" for different types of deafness and levels and pitches and so on. You need an audiologist to tell you that. Some will do hearing tests with different brands on or have people wear a brand for a few days and then hearing test that brand multiple times(with each brand) to help you figure out which one helps you understand the most. (I only had that done as a child in a hospital setting so I doubt that's common though)

It not hearing aids brand it what decibels loss % see what fits for u and price too  they will give u different options and style

1m4jahh,deaf,🌈Disability Pride Month Reflection🌈,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share something that’s been on my mind and in my heart as I’ve been learning more ASL and interacting a bit with the Deaf and HOH community online.

Something that’s honestly been bothering me is how often I see Deaf and HOH folks distancing themselves from the word “disabled.” I completely respect and admire the beautiful culture and language within the Deaf and HOH communities. It’s rich and meaningful, and it deserves celebration. But the reality is: not being able to hear, or having significant difficulty hearing, is a sensory disability. That doesn’t take away from Deaf pride or culture. In fact, it can coexist with disability pride.

I’m not deaf myself, but I do have hearing loss that affects my life, especially in conversations with background noise or while gaming. I also have vision problems and a sensory disability overall. These things don’t make my life less valuable, but they do shape how I experience the world.

It’s Disability Pride Month, and I think it’s important to remember:
♡ Disability is not a bad word.
♡ It’s not shameful.
♡ There’s a culture here too, a disability culture, and it’s just as valid.
♡ We can be proud of who we are and what we’ve achieved because of and despite our disabilities.

I really believe the discomfort around the word “disabled” often comes from internalized ableism, and that’s not the fault of any one group. It’s what society teaches all of us. But I hope we can continue working toward more unity and solidarity across our diverse communities, including deaf, HOH, blind, neurodivergent, physically disabled, and everyone else under this wonderful umbrella.

Issue is is that this office is extremely loud. There’s 50 people up here on the phones all day and music playing all day every day. 

At this point my hearing loss is affecting my success. I’ll be on the phone with someone and they’ll give me a lead like a name or a number or an address and then hang up. Only they didn’t give me the chance to ask them to repeat themselves. And I don’t get to follow up on that lead now. 

What can I ask for? Ideally I’d work remotely but I don’t feel secure asking to work remotely. They let some employees here do that, but I’ve only been here six months and my book of business isn’t big enough to leverage wfh status. 

I’m really frustrated at this office due to the noise level and I’m sick of acting like my hearing disability isn’t a problem. If it were quiet in here I wouldn’t be frustrated. I leave every day feeling maximum frustration. I’m on sensory overload here. 

Im at the point where I need to ask for accommodations but I’m honestly so scared because I don’t wanna swing my elbows and ask for demands and changes because I think it’ll put a target on my back. And I don’t think they’ll shine too brightly on a recent hire demanding to work remotely when I certainly don’t look or sound disabled.

1m359t0,deaf,Suggestions for Interpreter Options,"I’m hoping this community can help me out. Do you all have recommendations for video conference interpreters? Recommendations on the best set up for Sunday church services to do conference calls? 

Background info:
My father is the pastor of a small country church in WV. Very remote. The past month, we’ve had an older deaf man attend our church. He has lived in our community for a while but lack of other deaf/hoh community members has made him lonely and isolated, so he started going to our church since he has family here. He has one cousin that knows some ASL, and she has been doing her best to help interpret for us, but we recognize this is a band aid, and he cannot fully enjoy the services if we can’t find a better way to communicate with him. He has expressed a desire to be part of our church so it’s not like he’s just visiting. We have reached out to several certified interpreters through our state program already. Unfortunately, no one is willing or available to drive over an hour to do a two hour service once a week on a weekend. It’s understandable, but frustrating because this individual really wants to be part of us and we’re so glad to have him and we don’t want to fail him. The longer it takes us to find a solution, though, the more discouraged he gets. 

He has asked if we could perhaps do a Skype situation with screens. As long as we find a good program, this should be doable as we have decent internet. I ask about recommendations because we have zero experience with any interpreter programs and don’t really know what equipment would be needed. We thought maybe getting the large iPad Pro and a stand for him. That way it’s portable and we can set it up to point at the Sunday school teacher and pastor (two different rooms). Also he’d have more control of the set up and could possibly even swap the camera around to communicate with the interpreter directly as well. 

(Btw, before suggesting any speech to text options, I just want to add that this isn’t much of an option with a heavy WV accent. We’ve already looked at that and my dad is apparently unintelligible to voice recognition apps. 😂)

1m2vxj1,deaf,My son is HoH. I'm overwhelmed. I need advice.,"My son is 5 months old. I recently learned he has moderate hearing loss in both ears, and a lot of his hearing loss is in conversatioal pitches. I'm struggling to wrap my mind around what exactly this means. I don't know exactly what he can or cannot hear, and that is overwhelming to me. It would be easier to understand if he were profoundly deaf and could hear nothing. He has two hearing parents, and neither of us have any family or friends who are deaf or HoH. He also has a twin brother who is hearing and an older sister who lives with us part time and her mom the rest of the time. My husband and I are committed to learning and using ASL with him so that he always has access to language, but as hearing people, how do I find appropriate exposure to the language for him--especially when I don't know enough to be a part of any exposure he has. I took just enough ASL as an elective in college to know that he needs consistent exposure to people who are fluent, native speakers that he can learn from. I also want to make  sure our immediate family becomes fluent in ASL because I don't want to have a language barrier ever come between my son and our family. The audiogist told me that hearing aids will help, but they will not ever give him the equivalent of full hearing capabilities. I want him to have them as a tool he can use when he chooses to, but I also want him to know that if one day he decides to never put them on again, nothing will change. I love my son more than anything. I want to give him the whole world, and I'm overwhelmed by knowing that I can't be the one to teach him language in the same way I can teach his hearing brother. What else can I do to ensure he has the same access and opportunities we give his siblings?

1m2vq7l,deaf,Hearing aids in young babies,"Our three week old has been diagnosed with mild-moderate bilateral sensorineural HOH. It’s genetic from my husbands side, him, his dad and siblings are all HOH. All currently wear hearing aids, and all have a lot of opinions on hearings aids.

Everything I have read online seems to support getting hearing aids as soon as possible. My husband’s parents seem to both be against this, and think it is better to get them when he is a bit older, more like school age. They seem to have two main arguments, to give the ears a chance to naturally adapt (there seems to be 0 science I can find to support this), but also to give you a chance to naturally adapt and built up alternative forms of communication (things like learning to lip read). None of them had hearing aids this young as tests didn’t exist back then and “it didn’t hurt them”, so I think a lot of it is also the unknown. 

The audiologists advice was that hearing aids would be advised, but they suggested to wait until closer to 1. The logic is that the HOH is relatively mild (35-40 in both ears at most pitches) and the practicalities of hearing aids in young babies are a lot- appointments every two weeks to get them resized as they grow, it’s a bit of a nightmare to get them to actually wear them, and they’re asleep most of the time currently anyway. They did stress though that it is completely our choice and we should educate ourselves as much as possible. 

We’re in the new born trenches and extremely sleep deprived right now, so would love any and all experience/advice! We are currently thinking we will focus on communication style for the first 6/8 months (speaking loudly and facing little man, limiting background noise, introducing baby sign), and then aiming to get hearing aids fitted around the 9 month mark. This would be with the aim to keep him wearing them for the foreseeable, but of course to let him make the decision himself when he reaches that age. My husband wore them when he was younger but was bullied at school so did not wear them for teenage years or through university. He then got some as an adult at 21 and has worn them since.

Our plan was for him to start full time day care at 11 months, so we are thinking it makes sense to get them set up ahead of this while I’m still off work full time looking after him. Is there anything else I should be considering around day care? 

My final question is that both my first born and me and hearing, whereas husband and second child are both HOH. Any advice, or things to avoid, on how to manage this dynamic? Especially between the siblings.

I don't generally do that. I don't know the last time I ever did that literally in the middle of a conversation or argument. It happened just 5 minutes ago. Such a power move. Especially if they refuse to learn ASL. YiKeS

I have never done that lol ... but I've also never been told that in the midst of convo. It's actually easier for me to just stop paying attention and I won't know what they're saying anyway. Or if its a random person, I'd just smile and walk away.

I had hearing aids in both ears when I was a kid before I got the CI  on my right ear in college.  I'd take them off mid-conversation sometimes because yes, it is a power move but in the wrong direction.  I still remember the looks on my parent's faces.  Folks, I'm lucky to be alive ha...

Even though I'm profoundly deaf, I mainstreamed and never learned sign language.  The endless hours of speech therapy, every single day for a decade.  I don't have a speech impediment,  ""deaf accent"" or whatever, which resulted in  ""You can hear when you want to"" from classmates, teachers, everyone. They legit thought this.  No, I'm legit deaf.  Deaf as a post in both ears, it's an echo chamber in there without my CI.  You'd think I'd get used to it after the 1000th time but nope.

It takes a gentle soul to suffer ignorance and smile.

Waiting what? 

How hearing people in company work refuse hiring deaf people when they took the advantage of ASL with CI about deaf culture? Maybe, deaf people knew enough the part of the story to express them.

1m2hh8w,deaf,Offensive?,"My family is in the process of adopting a deaf dog. My kids like the name Echo, but we are concerned this could be considered offensive to the deaf community. Is it acceptable or should we look for a different option?

[댓글]
If you named it Alexander Graham Bell, THAT would be offensive.

Not offensive at all but you MUST pay the dog tax (let’s see a picture) 🥰

You know there's a whole Deaf superhero named Echo, yes?

I don't think the dog would find any name offensive.

I don't find the name offensive, it's not like you're making fun of us. You're naming a dog.

I will be offended if you don't post pictures of that dog though, that would be unnacceptable.

No, my partner and I named our car after Echo the Deaf superhero from Marvel Cinema Universe

Yes it's highly offensive to talk about your dog and not post any pictures of them!! (But seriously no this is fine, I think it's really cute)

Not at all

Echo in the comics literally chose that name for that reason, a Native American reference and her ability copy and recreate physical ability similar to Taskmaster. That said I named my first dog at like 7-9 “Shaq” cause he was a big black grunt of the litter of Labs

Honestly, the way I see it, it’s wordplay and very fitting and hilarious. If you’re looking for a stamp of approval, you’ve got mine.

Not offensive at all! 
Like one poster here said.. That made me think of the Deaf superhero instantly. Check it out sometime.

The name is cute.  You’re going to offend somebody with whatever name you choose.

Eh I’m not keen on the name echo for a deaf dog. We don’t hear echoes. I don’t like the name for the deaf Marvel superhero either, especially not the explanation “copy other people’s moves”.   

I retain the right to be pissed off with Marvel. They are a giant billion dollar multinational corporation &amp; have the money to do better. 

For you, my views really don’t matter at all to your kids. Your kids can name their lovely deaf dog whatever they like. You’re the one paying to house and feed the dog &amp; that counts for a lot &amp; I hope you teach it lots of commands in sign language. 

Thank you for asking about the name and feel free to ignore grumpy old me.

I think that's a perfect name for a deaf dog. It doesn't offend deaf me.

If it helps, I am deaf and my cat is named Echo. No correlation to anyone's deafness, I just thought it was cute. My mother did make the joke that it's ironic I named my cat after something I can't hear. 😂

But no, this would by no means be offensive.

No it's not offensive at all

1m2acxs,deaf,Working on a public airport design and would love your help.,"Howdy! I am working on the construction of a new public airport project in the US and I would love to hear the opinion of this community on one (or more!) of our issues.

We have several telephones (payphones for public use) and courtesy phones (phones used for paging within the airport), for which we are providing TTY devices. I need to recommend a specific device to the airport ownership for them to buy, and I want to provide whichever brand/product is most comfortable and easy to use. I've seen several products so far, but do you have any recommendations for devices you like best? Anything to avoid?

I’d also love to hear any thoughts from the deaf community about airport design in general – maybe you can help us avoid some of the common pitfalls/annoyances and provide a great experience to the traveling public. Thank you so much in advance for sharing your thoughts.

[댓글]
Have you considered hiring an accessibility consultant?

We never hear the PAs. We need something visual to show us what the PA said. Like if we're supposed to change gates, can we have small digital,signs t the gates flashing to get our attn then tell us what the gate change is. It is so stressful when we can't hear urgent PAs

TTY is outdated. Why not get a Video Phone? Sorenson makes public VP booths, similar to payphones.

What i want in an airport: Oahu has tv screens with announcements in text so I can read. Yay! However,  other islands do not.  San antonio has tv screens with interpreters! Yay! Other airports do not.  C'mon airports! Do better! Language access for all!!!

If you go on TikTok or IG, type in ""accessible airport deaf"" or ""deaf airport"" and you will see PLENTY of Deaf people making content about struggles or cool accessibility features in airports. See some ideas of whats already out there. Miami has interpreters on the screens in the airport. Keep in mind that audio announcements are not accessible.  Captions should be on EVERY screen. Deaf people with cochlear implants may make the metal detectors go off. Staff need to be trained. (Most) Deaf people don't automatically need wheelchairs. Some airports are utilizing Aira ASL which is an App that pulls up an interpreter for the airport.

Hi. Just a feedback: TTY is an outdated mode of communication that very few % uses it. I would love if you had a top notch WiFi so I can make video calls.

Three general points:

Futureproof announcement systems with Auracast for hearing aid users (remembering of course that many deaf passengers don't wear hearing aids, don't have compatible aids if they do, and may still not understand enough).

Some airports use Facebook Messenger/Whatsapp chat agents which allow customers to get notifications about gate updates, security queue times etc.

Linked to the 2nd point, make as much as information about the airport available as possible. There are apps that serve as guides to airports e.g. FLIO.

Mod note: this breaks rule # 1 but I’m going to allow it since this is a good topic, will hopefully benefit deaf people, and I also work in the industry.

Lots of good advice already. Generally speaking, do you know when we’re left out or get problems? I’d say there are two main scenarios:

* Unexpected, sudden and unplanned changes. People and organizations often have prepared accommodations for things they expect might happen, but as soon as things don’t go according to plan and there is a rush, then everyone wants robust phones and speech - and that just doesn’t work well for us. 

* Social settings. There is too much noise for us to hear and participate. Quiet places to relax and good lighting and visibility are things that can make things easier.

I think having a text of current airport announcements on the find-your-gate and the gate boards would be extremely helpful. ASL is amazing also, but so many people grow up hearing and never learn it (I’m late deaf).

Please remember people with hearing loss, with and without assistive devices. Auracast will be great but it won’t be universal for a while. The only currently universal standard is the Hearing Loop, which connects to users through a telecoil in their hearing aids/cochlear/other device. 
Contact the city or county ADA Compliance Officer or equivalent. And their Office for People with Disabilities. Architect designs may follow the letter of ADA but not the spirit. See if the state has an Office for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. Good on you for asking here, but there should be official resources for you. It’s sooo much cheaper if you learn what actual travelers need BEFORE design’s are finalized. Lots of Deaf, deaf, and HoH people would be happy to participate I. Focus groups, online especially.  AND contact the Hearing Loss Association of America for the chapter closest to you. Thanks for thinking of this!!!

One thing to mention is to be mindful of the type of materials you use. Could you make sure they are sound as a dollar? For a while, I worked at the ABQ Sunport, and their tile floor is pretty. When people are walking and pulling their suitcases, the sound can make conversation difficult for the hearing-impaired.

No one will use your TTY. 😬👍🏻

Likely outside your scope and I would hope there are more elegant solutions to this, but at security: green lights and red lights both before (to go through) the scanner/detector and separate ones after to alert a passenger if they’re okay to proceed or need additional screening.

Proceeding to pick up our carry on is not ignoring commands for additional screening, it’s not hearing those commands.

Also, incredibly awkward to walk toward screening before one’s turn or hold up the line because we didn’t know to go.

At the gates, better boarding indications.

I tend to loiter near the gate so I can see the relatively small screen that may or may not align with the boarding group being called.

But that might simply require better training and more screens.

Oh wait.

That.

Better training of front facing airport staff and loads more screens - perhaps with an indication that the info on the screen is for the deaf.

Stream of consciousness: is there a standard place to put braille signage?  If I see something in braille I know it’s not for me. But the people who need the braille signs might not know to look for available info they don’t know is there.

I sort of rambled off the rails at the end, but I’m thrilled when people involved in design of public spaces consult with the people who have disabilities. The individual communities can provide additional nuance the laws might miss.

Just my 2¢

Good question! For TTY devices, honestly I don't have much hands-on experience with them since I work more on the software side of things with Simpleway, but from what I've seen I'd just go with established brands that have decent support and warranty. Main things to look for are reliability, easy to use for people who aren't super tech savvy, and that it works well with whatever phone system you're using.

Since you're asking about accessibility stuff in general, thought I'd share some things from airport projects I've been involved with. Visual paging is basically a must-have now for us - showing all the audio announcements as text on screens around the terminal.

We've also done hearing loop installations in gate areas and service counters which work really well. I'll share a link about project we did in Canada if you're interested. [Link](https://www.airport.cx/news/breaking-barriers-windsor-international-airport-becomes-canadas-first-to-implement-large-area-hearing-loops)

The most complicated thing we're working on right now is getting sign language interpretation right into the flight info displays. It's way more complex than you'd think - you have to somehow combine pre-recorded sign language videos with live flight data like gate changes and delays. But the bigger headache is when they want to update the actual messaging content - like once a year when they want to change announcements or add new info, you basically have to re-record everything with an interpreter which gets expensive and time consuming. We are experimenting internaly with AI-generated avatars to address this issue, although their reliability is still not satisfactory at the moment, but it is expected to improve in the future.

And are you guys looking at any other accessibility features besides the phones?

I wear BTE hearing aids to help me hear somewhat, but honestly, I’ve spent my whole life watching people struggle to accept that they can’t hear. For me? I’m proud of who I am. You know how awesome it feels to just turn everything off and enjoy complete silence? Today was my day off, and I decided not to wear my hearing aids. To be honest, I forgot how peaceful and productive silence can be. I actually got so much done today. To anyone out there struggling: don’t be ashamed of being deaf. 

[댓글]
I definitely get frustrated sometimes but I do agree it’s a big part of my identity and I wouldn’t change it. It was a long journey to get there though.

I used to think it was my own frustration being deaf that made me feel “less than”

Especially by my so called family members who would have supposedly understand my struggles more than average hearing person. 

As I gotten older and years of dealing with MANY various hearing folks; it isn’t my own deafness I’m frustrated. It’s the ableism and their lack of empathy and ignorance that is the real barrier for me. 

So, once I realized that; it was very empowering and started to act I don’t owe any hearing person my life.

THIS. 100%. I love complete silence on the days I choose not to wear my HAs. No annoying dog barking, loud TVs, etc. My HAs are the last thing I put on before leaving home, and the first thing to come off after getting home. My family is so used to it. They know.

We are the same with the hearing but I have always let it get the best of me, I pass up promotions and positions because of fear of “what if I don’t be able to understand what team members will try to tell me” “what if I miss something so important simply because I didn’t hear it”. Everyone says I have awesome leadership skills and experience but fear always gets me.

Oral deaf school taught me to be ashamed of my deafness which is a MUCH bigger handicap than not being able to hear perfectly, it took me years to stop being ashamed of and to accept my deafness.

For the first time in my life I added that I am deaf to my instagram bio! Learning to feel proud of who I am 🫶🏽

My deafness / visual issues is like one in a million live births. I can’t think of anything positive about it. I just want to cry in the Father’s arms.

Several years ago as my hearing began to change i very much hated who i am .. since then I have lost my voice which has challenges of its own .. but ... I have stood and spoken not once but twice internationally for my workplace, been part of a project that created jobs for D/hoh, am currently in ASL 7 and have a certificate of achievement for studies in ASL with Seneca college and two more certificates for completing ASL for first responders and ASL for early childhood educators. Things I would have never had if it wasn't for ~~hearing loss~~ ... **Deaf Gains .** I still push myself to do better and change perceptions of who I am and what I can do !

I wasn't born deaf.  I had no idea how to properly take care of my ears in the past plus I got an infection at the time of the Covid which left me deaf at 29. Thank you for your words of encouragement.

💯

Look, u/RedHeadridingOrca I’m sorry my post wasn’t helpful for you, but we all have our struggles. I deal with mine every day. I might lose 100% of my hearing soon, and I’m still proud of who I am. If there’s nothing you can do about it, why not own it? I’ll never apologize for being proud.

I grew up in both the Deaf and hearing communities. If you want to see what pride looks like, go to a Deaf event and actually talk to people. That’s where you’ll meet people who’ve stopped apologizing for existing.

I haven’t used ASL in years. I’ve lost touch with my Deaf and HOH friends. Life happens. I can still read ASL, but I can’t sign back fast or clearly anymore. That’s why I’m planning to take classes again and start going to the events again before I lose my hearing fully.

I was just like you once. I hated it and wanted to be “normal.” But isolating yourself won’t help. Surround yourself with people like us. We share more than you think, and you might meet someone who’s walking the same path as you.

I really do hope you find peace with it.

I love being able to switch between not hearing and hearing. The loneliness in large groups where you can't hear anything is the worst. You feel alone with other people. But we have many advantages. We are visual, we have to notice small details and extra information that others might miss, and what actually gives me peace of mind is that I don't have to worry about suddenly losing my sense of hearing when I get old. You will already have several years of experience of how to use your processor or hearing aid. The worst thing is to lose a sense that has worked all your life and suddenly you have to learn to adapt all over again.😬

I was told as a young teen that I wasn't ""deaf enough"" for the deaf community. I was mainstreamed throughout school because my dad was in the Army and in the 70s, there weren't any programs in the 70s for kids who would move out of state every two to four years. (I'm 55 now). I didn't even really call myself ""deaf"" despite being literally born deaf in one ear and HoH in the other. I was in my early 40s when I decided that ""I'm hard of hearing"" (or ""hearing impaired"" because that's what I grew up being called) wasn't accurate enough. I'm deaf *and* hard of hearing. 

The people around me who care about it don't make a big deal about it either. They just step over to my HoH side if I'm not wearing my hearing aids.

1m1h2tp,deaf,I'm going deaf and don't know what language to learn,"I somewhat recently learned I'm going deaf, I'm already hard of hearing so I'm used to some of the struggles but one big issue is I don't know what language to learn.  I live in Europe and greatly enjoy the freedom of movement here. I live in Germany right now but will certainly move to the Netherlands soon, for maybe a year then move again maybe to Portugal... You get the picture. I found ISL but also heard it's not super common to know. ASL Wikipedia claims it's the Lingua Franca of sign but Americans like to claim things like that with not a lot of basis. So what is the best language to learn to communicate on a decent basic level with as much people as possible in Europe?

[댓글]
ISL is sometimes used at conferences or online spaces (from what I've heard), but it’s not a full language and not widely fluent for everyday use. ASL is mostly limited to North America, so it’s not super useful across Europe unless you’re talking to international Deaf people.

If you’re looking for the most practical option, I’d suggest learning the sign language of the country you're in-- DGS for now, and later you can pick up NGT or other regional ones.

It's easiest to learn the language of the place you are in, because you can get practice with people around you. Having a foundation in one sign language prepares you to learn others. Unfortunately, none of the three countries you'll be living in have related sign languages.

International Sign (IS) is the lingua franca of sign in Europe, but it's unlikely you'll find classes in it. If you do, they will assume that you already know at least one other sign language, because IS isn't really a language...it's a mixture of common vocabulary and the grammar and features of your own sign language.

If you're moving around a lot, I guess I would pick a language that you could study online, and stick with it. It's *better* to have people around you but your situation seems unique as a late-deafened person without sign background, so given that you are moving a lot, look for something online. Once you get comfortable with it, start thinking about IS.

And no, don't study ASL. I say this as an American whose primary language is ASL - yes, it has a global *influence*, but it's not globally *used* so you'll do much better studying a language local to your region.

The important thing is learning A signed language, it's much easier to pick up others once you know one. ISL isn't a full language and isn't really used outside of conferences etc, so that's not a good choice. ASL is probably more universal than other signed languages but absolutely not the 'world language' in the way spoken English is. It's used in some countries that have no native signed language and in a lot of international media, but it's very rare to find someone in Europe who uses ASL instead of (or even as well as unless they're from the US or travel there a lot) the local signed language. If you know you're going to the Netherlands soon for sure I'd say learn theirs, otherwise learn German and add on others later

You've already had some great advice so I just wanna nitpick a little.

&gt;I found ISL

Nitpick but - IS, not ISL.

This is small but important because IS is a pidgin that allows Deaf folks of different SL backgrounds to communicate. Learning it as your first SL is not advisable, because it assumes you already have a strong basis of signing.

&gt;ASL Wikipedia claims it's the Lingua Franca of sign but Americans like to claim things like that with not a lot of basis.

Yeah this is a WILD claim.

&gt;Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. **ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca.** ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). 

The things before and after are true, and it is true that ASL is probably the most learnt second sign language in the world (case in point - myself) - but if you expect to go to *a random country* and use ASL with a Deaf person there you will be sorely disappointed.

Here in Britain at least, many people would categorically not understand ASL if used with them. They know maybe a smattering at most.

Deaf people, including ASL using Deaf people, can usually travel and communicate pretty decently with other Deaf people. Like I had a friend here in Britain who was American who communicated quite well. But when they do so, most often they use a form of IS - with varying amounts of ASL thrown in there. When I talk with Americans online (and with said friend) I usually mix ASL and BSL to get my point across (and it works decently well).

Exactly, well said, woofirgrrl. Stick with one language and learn it as you go—I've found international signs to be an intuitive skill. You'll meet people who are lingually expert and adjust their vocabulary in international signs to communicate with you. It goes naturally. Let it be organic in your learning.

I’m also in a similar struggle. Most of my connections have access to learning ASL, but I live in Spain (LSE) so it’s incompatible with half of my goals. 

For you, I’d suggest learning the one where you think you’ll first be settled for 3-4 years. That’s enough time to get proficient in a language and build a social network!

I am having the same struggle. I learned most of my sign language in the late 70s and through the 80s. I even went to classes, but no one told me there was an ASL and ESL until the late 90s when I went to college. I would like to bring my knowledge up to date, but I am so confused.

1m15u2e,deaf,I (20F) want to be a better friend to my deaf friend (23M).,"Hello! It’s nice to meet everyone. I’m a hearing 20 year old and recently, I met a deaf friend that I get along well with.

When we hang out in person, my friend usually tells me to speak as I would with anyone to practice listening (he’s in a university program and doesn’t always have an interpreter so he wanted to practice), which is usually fine in quieter places because of his hearing aid, but I have been thinking of picking up more ASL words or phrases to better communicate in loud spaces (we like to go to the mall together, and it gets really loud so sometimes he can’t hear me). I’ve been taking my phone out to write things out for him so far if he says it’s hard to hear me.

I had a few questions:

1. If he’s specifically asking me to talk to him, would he be offended if I tried to pick up some ASL words to use when it gets too loud to hear me? 

2. Do you have any other advice for communicating with a deaf person in busier spaces?

3. He told me he wants to improve his pronunciation, so he wants to talk more with me. When I asked him what I could do to help, he told me to point out any words he might pronounce incorrectly. Aside from this, is there anything I can do to help him with that in particular?

So far, I asked him about talking in loud places and he said typing is fine, but I notice he always apologizes so much for me needing to take out my phone. I always tell him I’m happy just to talk to him and spend time with him. I feel really sad when he does that. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for your time.

If he's specifically asking me to talk to him, would he be offended if I tried to pick up some ASL words to use when it gets too loud to hear me?

He won't be offended if you try to pick up ASL. As a deaf person who mostly speaks, I would be very happy if someone learn to sign with me.

2. Do you have any other advice for communicating with a deaf person in busier spaces?

Not much you can do, in my personal experience I tend to move closer to the person to hear a bit better. You can always type in a phone or sign if you learn some. But quiet places are the best.

3. He told me he wants to improve his pronunciation, so he wants to talk more with me. When I asked him what I could do to help, he told me to point out any words he might pronounce incorrectly. Aside from this, is there anything I can do to help him with that in particular?

Definitely try signing while saying the word to improve his pronunciation. 

While sign language is not a foundation for most deaf people. The majority need sign language to help express and communicate effectively.

Is he sad, or does he feel guilt about you making that effort to communicate with him?  Perhaps both.

I am reminded of a time when I went to deaf camp once a year in SC when I was growing up.  The vast majority signed, but I did not know how to sign.  Each cabin was its own group, and 1 day of that week, we would all go camping and meet the other groups.  Somehow, I made a friend with a deaf person who didn't speak.  I learned the alphabet as fast as I possibly could and the rest I would write in the dirt whenever it got ridiculous alphabetting (yeah I now that's  not a word, but..) what I wanted to say.  Communication is an amazing thing!  Both sides putting in the effort.. It will develop over time.  My advice is to just let it ride, and enjoy the process along the way! :)

Does your friend want to talk or write because he doesn't know ASL?

I'd talk to him about it more and let him know your thoughts (especially if you're good friends). 

I have asked certain friends to please stay with talking/typing because I don't want to become their teacher. 

I don't enjoy reading lips, but in some cases it's best and it's also great practice on my part.

When it comes to helping him ""hear you"" in loud environments I'd look into a lapel mic. 

They're rather inexpensive (under 20 on Amazon) and portable.

Your friend plugs a pic receiver into his phone with something like Live Transcribe or Ava open and you wear a mic that links you directly to his phone so the transcribing works in louder environments.

I have used these with friends at concerts, theme parks, and all types of ""loud places"" and it works great. 

My only real issue is that I struggle with English so sometimes I need clarification of what something means.

Well done for asking, you sound like a great friend!

1) Definitely not offensive, but it may be unhelpful. Speaking and listening is so hard and it's very easy to slip into just signing (or basic sign supported by writing) when someone can sign a bit, which is very nice but also very counterproductive if you're trying to learn and focus on speech. For deaf people who don't have many people they can sign with having a hearing friend learn some ASL is lovely, but for people who have a lot of ASL users around them already a hearing friend they can practice speech with without judgement or impatience is much rarer and more valuable. Idk which of these applies to him obviously but it's worth thinking about - in general I'd say just do what he's asked you to and don't overthink it. If you think he might actually like you to sign but feels bad about asking ask him that directly, don't assume. Also worth checking that he actually knows ASL himself, not all deaf people do!!

2) Remember to face him (as straight as possible) when you're speaking and try to pick environments with good lighting levels and without the light behind you. Repeat things in the same words if he asks you to. Don't be afraid to write stuff down, gesture, point or use your facial expression to make things clearer. Don't obsess over whether he's understood every little thing - it's normal for deaf people to miss stuff, we're used to it and it's not an issue

3) Not really, you're not a speech therapist and it would be unreasonable for him to expect you to be. He's asked you to point out things he mispronounces so do that, that's plenty.

I’d say asking him about it and having a good conversation on communication would be the most helpful and mindful, mostly just try ur best to make him feel comfortable about taking his time and making sure he knows you understand and are more than happy to be patient with him, learning sign can always be helpful no matter who you are so I’d suggest doing it regardless but also I highly doubt he’d be offended by it. When I’ve been asked by people if they should learn sign it makes me excited to share with them as long as I know they’re ACTUALLY dedicated to learning it :))

1m0z667,deaf,Advice for car rides?,"Hi! Does anyone have advice on how I can keep my 5 month old deaf baby calm during a car ride to and from doctor’s appointments?

A bit of background, my baby was born without an auditory nerves and has malformed cochlea. So we’ve been learning ASL and have our first in home visit with our deaf mentor (from our local deaf school) this month!

With that being said, my baby gets upset and cries after about 10 minutes of being in the car. As a hearing parent, it absolutely breaks my heart. I provide a pacifier and a sensory toy. But shortly after, my baby spits out the pacifier and loses the toy. It’s hard for me to pull over safely sometimes to help.

Any advice? I would love to hear some suggestions!! Thank you!!

I just learned about a mirror you can attach to the right side of your windshield.   Baby might be calmer if you can see each other. Maybe baby feels alone or abandoned if they can't see you as they can't hear you.

Do they have a mobile?

Just consistency. He’ll figure it out that he sees you again after getting there. You’re a good mom!

I can’t help you too much as my brother had 5 sisters in the car. Two of which (me) are deaf also but when we didn’t comfort or entertain him as a baby he had tablet on the back of the seat we could all put cartoons on. Doesn’t matter that he could’ve understand just that something was happening. He also loves his plushes.

Just a wild thought but if the semicircular canals are not working correctly they could be feeling weird balance sensations in the car?  Who knows. But I agree that being able to see u is very important.

People who are born deaf tend to rely heavily on visual cues and physical touch for comfort and connection. It sounds like he might not like being by himself much. Maybe you could try using a small blanket that vibrates or hums, or hang light-up toys where he can see them, especially during car rides. That might help him feel a little less alone, or he may be feeling carsick.",2025-07-16 00:58:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m0z667/advice_for_car_rides/

By having a smoke detector with flashing lights. Same goes for doorbell.

I'm on the third storey so... I'm dead either way if my building catches fire.


Not been a problem yet :))

Service dog. Very good boy

My service dog alerts me to certain noises. 

Smoke alarm, doorbell, phone, kids, and so on. 

People without a service dog can use strobe smoke alarms (check your city, some fire departments have them for free), some even hook to a bed shaker.

I don’t 🤷‍♂️ If there’s a fire while I’m sleeping, I’m toast. Not worried about it. Someone could also break into my house while I’m sleeping too.

Service dog. Also have an alerting system with a strobe light and bed shaker

By having hearing family. My sisters and Mother each having an assignment member to wake up. We are three deaf and three hearing. Mother wakes me up (oldest deaf sister) oldest hearing sister wakes up my deaf brother (also youngest child) and my younger hearing sister wakes up my deaf sister. 

When or even if we live alone I don’t know but probably a flashing smoke alarm or something that vibrates if that exists, haven’t looked into stuff like that too much yet.

Dying in my sleep is my preferred way of going, so….

I live in student accommodation so my block RA has a master key to open my door and wakes me up when the fire alarm goes off

I’m hearing and slept through a fire alarm in the Gallaudet dorms! I did have earplugs in due to loud music in another room, but yikes! Woke up to a strange man standing over me with strobe lights flashing. Surreal experience.  It was not fun trying to convince the deaf admin folks not to fine me for ignoring a fire alarm.

In my student accom I’m in a deaf and wheelchair adapted flat (I’m not deaf, I’m hard of hearing but they don’t want to take any chances with my safety) so all the fire alarms flash brightly and in some flats the bed shakes but I don’t think mine does, so yea flashing lights, I’d honestly prefer bed shaking tho cos my migraines are triggered by flashing lights/bright lights😂but then again I’d rather be alive with a migraine than dead in a fire

I suppose you'd need a way for your doorbell to wake you up. my aunt recently had a neighbor wake them up by ringing their doorbell to tell them their garage was on fire

People in my house know to wake me up

You can use baby alert- transmitter and receiver. Your alarm will be so loud it will signal it to go off

Most smoke and CO strobe detectors are hard wired only,  there are a few 120v plug-in models and all of them are expensive.  As for me, I plan on my hearing wife outliving me (we have the audible battery powered smoke and CO detectors).  One thing I know is that sometimes local nonprofits or fire safety organizations have free alarms.

In the UK you can get the fire service to come to your house and set something up for free. The option they gave us was a flat pad that sits under your pillow that it attached to the fire alarm and vibrates if it goes off.

Technology help

Service dog! He saved my life from a 3 alarm house fire. I was ignoring him thinking there was someone at the bedroom door and I didn’t want to be bothered. He actually BIT my leg!! Not hard but it was more like HEY GET THE FUCK UP MOM!!! I opened the door and there was a black wall of smoke. Scariest day of my life. The house burned down and my ex boyfriend’s mom died and her dog died too. Definitely look into a service dog. I trained him myself. It was really hard to do but we did it. 🙂 he was featured in a magazine and was semi finalist at American humane hero dog awards

Just enjoy life.  You've made it far enough to have your own home.

Life is too short to worry about alarms.",2025-07-15 22:55:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m0wg80/how_do_you_currently_stay_safe_from_home_fires_at/
1m0jjhi,deaf,"Those that weren’t born deaf, what caused it?","I’m deaf, I have hearing aids. My hearing is deteriorating very very quickly. I can no longer hear any back ground noise it’s so silent apart from my tinnitus screaming none stop. I don’t know what’s causing it. 

[댓글]
I have a genetic loss, but I don't remember the details (if I ever knew them). 

FWIW - when I got my cochlear implant, once it was turned on, my tinnitus went away. I had it nonstop up until activation and then maybe once every few years since.

Spinal mengitis at 16 months old.  My temp was 105, and it burned out all the cochlear hair cells.

My mom suspects I was born hoh (just like her) but there weren't any tests to prove otherwise, just lots of really bad grades k-12 plus the fact I never listened to a single person in my whole life, people would speak to me and I would do my own thing even if it wrong. Get yelled at and do it again the same way. 😆 

I had a TBI in 2022, had hearing one night, woke up the next morning was deaf. My audiologist told me you have profound hearing loss across all but lowest range. Audiologist told me I don't have a single patient in my practice with hearing this bad at a young age. Tried selling me hearing aids but I didn't bite. VR gave me Hearing aids but don't work for me. Learning ASL at 44 has been challenging but I'm further alone and more proficient than I thought. Use ASL more than my voice.

My mother had a non cancerous brain tumor, lost all of her hearing on one side, most of it on the other, which has gotten worse as time wore on. She is why I’m on this sub, she lost her hearing when I was 5 or so so it’s the only way I know my mother. 
Treatment for this type of tumor has improved in the past 40+ years, so people who are diagnosed with it now will not loose their hearing.

Head injury.

Severe ear infections as a child

No idea. Done MRI and genetic testing. Nothing that explains my HL. I know I have dead zones in my cochlea though.

Spinal Meningitis at 23 while at university

I was oxygen deprived when I was born. So I've been deaf since birth, but I wasn't deaf before birth. If that makes since. It was the lack of oxygen to my brain that caused my deafness.

I went deaf overnight about 18 yrs ago - was fine in the evening not ill no cold etc and woke up with very little sound no speech clarity, I pick up base beats or deep sound but I do t know if I hear or feel it if that makes sense 

I was rushed to hospital and had scans for brain tumour and Lumbar Punch for meningitis, which was a nightmare as I have my back pinned and plated along with bone grafts so they had to do it using X-Ray to get needle in. 

Both were clear we just don’t know what caused it. 
Hearing aids are useless I have chronic tinnitus too which drives me nuts

Untreated cholesteatoma

Broke a windshield with my head in 1981.

MMR in 1975 age 3

I was born with very little hairs around both my cochleas. Doctors didn't know this at the time and thought I had ""selective hearing."" My hearing slowly went down throughout my childhood as what little hairs I did have, disappeared. I was FINALLY diagnosed properly at a children's hospital and I got hearing aids when I was 8. I am Deaf and I did get a cochlear implant on my left side in my mid-30s. I'm 41 now.

You know that Schwarzenegger meme, ""IT'S NOT A TUMOR!""  Well, turns out it was. Two of em.

Genetics. We all suffer cochlear nerve degeneration, starting in late adolescence. By middle age, we usually have unilateral moderate-to-severe hearing loss. By the time we're senior citizens, the other ear begins to catch up; when my grandfather passed, he had moderate-to-severe hearing loss in his 'good' ear and was profoundly deaf in his other ear.

What's worse is we also are neurodivergent and suffer from APD, starting in early adolescence. So, even before we have measurable hearing loss, we suffering hearing difficulties when communicating with others.

Despite all this, I was the first in our family to learn ASL, and didn't begin until my early-30s. We'd just chalked up deafness as an 'obstacle' we had to handle as we got older. Now that I know better, I've ensured my kids are learning ASL, not only so we can all communicate better but also to prepare them for what's an inherited probability for their future.

I'm not profoundly deaf, but hearing loss is associated with my condition hEDS. It's becoming more commonly diagnosed now and people are learning more about it. It was considered extremely rare when I was diagnosed, but we all keep learning!

If I could find an audiologist to care, I might have an answer. All I know is that my mom started to lose her hearing, fast, in her early 20's, and so did her first daughter. I'm her third, and the same thing happened to me.

Canada, free healthcare... If you can find it.

I had chronic untreated ear infections in both ears as a kid. I was in foster care so my hearing just gradually deteriorated because it got left untreated.

Played drums in a rock band from 17 to 25 without protecting my hearing. Both eardrums were perforated multiple times. I thought protecting my hearing would restrict me from kissing girls. As it turned out, it made no difference. I lost a lot of my hearing, and still didn't kiss many girls.

Started wearing earplugs when playing at 25, but by 33 my hearing was deteriorating rapidly. Left side is loud tinnitus and right side is regular hearing loss.

I wear hearing aids now, at 42, and my hobby is long distance running. I often think about getting an electric kit, but all the versions I've tried that made me feel like it was a close approximation to my old acoustic kit are many thousands of pounds.

[deleted]

I injured my left ear scuba diving years ago via barotrauma and somehow my right ear is worse now and I've been told it is probably genetic (after an MRI ruled out other stuff) as other people in my family have had the same issue.

Had cholesteatoma in both ears, so had to do radical mastoidectomy. First surgery for first ear went well, but second surgery caused total loss of hearing.

Then the cholesteatoma returned in the first ear, which had me do a second mastoidectomy, where the surgeon had to  remove almost everything, and dropped my hearing to about 10%. I now use bone attached hearing aids, and life is ok with them.

Covid—caused SSHL (though the mechanism isn’t totally understood, but possibly Meniere’s).

Genetical, gradual loss

Both my brother and I had measles &amp; mumps about the same time as kids (&lt;7) and got nerve damage in ears.  I started with 1 HA at age 30 and 2 HA at 50.  Older brother started with 1 HA at 40. 

There was no definitive smoking gun for cause but whatever we just dealt with it.  I'm 62 now. Both of my boys have perfect hearing.

born deaf in one ear, lost 98% in the other from sleeping gas when they use it on me to fix a broken arm

One parent had contracted Scarlet Fever and the other Spinal Meningitis leading both to total hearing loss.

Deaf on one side hoh on the other. The deafness was caused by the mumps when I was a toddler. The hoh side is a combination of age and my love of live music i think.

measles which evolved into encephalitis. f**k Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

Untreated ear infections as a child, big holes in one ear drum and heavy scarring on the other. Then a few more ear infections as an adult (because getting the hoely one wet is a risk) and generally by the time I'd argued a doctor into giving me heavy duty antibiotics I'd lost a bit more hearing.

Got sucker punched and cracked my skull on the sidewalk through hearing canals. That out of the way, you should go get your hearing tested again. You might just need to get your hearing aids adjusted.

I had pneumonia meningitis at age of 4

No idea. I was diagnosed at 13 and they did tons of tests but found nothing. We assume I've had it since birth though

I was 50 when I failed a pre-employment hearing test. I didn't know I had hearing problems. I thought I wasn't listening hard enough. I had worn bilateral HAs for 20 years until my left ear went deaf overnight. I am now a bimodal user with one CI and one HA at 70. My father and grandfather wore HAs in their 60s and 70s. I think a lot of my hearing loss came from noise exposure. I was a medicolegal transcriptionist. Headphones on 18 hours a day with very loud voices.

I'm HOH and now wear hearing aids. My hearing issues were initially caused by a birth injury. The birth vacuum was slipping around. Tada, hearing damage á la SNHL. 

My hearing did worsen over time and I ignored it (because all the adults did) until last year when I got Covid, which left me with persistent tinnitus. So I went to the audiologist. Turns out my hearing was much worse than I thought! It's strange to hear birds or listen to songs I grew up with an have them sound completely different.

Concussive injury from the army. Was a bit too close when something went bang.

No idea, tried MRI, a lot of blood test, found nothing. I was moderate hearing loss back then but it keep progressively worsening so now I'm at severe.

Got sick around age 13–14, and not long after that, I lost all my hearing. It turned out to be Cogan's syndrome.

A moment of terror followed by lots of moments of sadness.

SSNHL sudden sensorineural hearing loss

scarlet fever (as a teenager) of all things triggered mine- how victorian, i know. it's gotten worse over the years, but testing for any other causes has come up clear.

NF2 mutation, ended up having a seizure from it when I was 25. They had to remove some tumors in my ears. Ended up losing my hearing.

Genetic, most likely Meniere's disease according to one of the audiologists I saw, it started for me ~6 years earlier than everyone else in my family and my initial hearing loss was a lot more rapid than them too (6 years from hoh to deaf for me vs 15 years from hoh to deaf for everyone else), been deaf 6 years now (and getting more deaf every year wooo!) and I'm the first in my family to learn sign language.

My hearing loss tends to increase permanently after each ""episode"", however I don't get much vertigo or nausea during episodes so that's a win for me!

Absolutely no reason. No sickness, no genetic reasons, none. Started with mild loss and now I'm profoundly deaf.

I was born hearing impaired. Fast forward 30 years and a genetic test told me it's caused by something called connexin 26, a mutation in the GJB2 gene. My child is also hearing impaired and wears hearing aids. We're working on learning ASL...no one ever cared to get me help or teach me ASL so it's bringing up deep grief for me.

I'm only partially severely HOH on one side, in my case it's a tumor near my ear canal.

Mine was caused bilateral acoustic neuroma . It’s a brain tumor. It happened over night. Was using hear aids prior it, now they are of no use.

I was born premature so I was very prone to infection. I had loads of damaging ear infections which led to surgery after surgery until I reached number 14 and that surgery actually made my hearing worse instead of helping. I also have a genetic condition that helped out bit didn't do all the work alone.

Meningitis at 6 months old

A botched tympanoplasty. I'd had tubes in my ears as a kid and one of my eardrums didn't heal after the tubes came out. It was a pretty small hole in my eardrum but whenever I went swimming water would get stuck in there and it wasn't pleasant, so when my ENT offered the surgery I went ahead with it. He then proceeded to mangle my eardrum so badly he didn't allow me to look at the images, but my mom saw and she said it looked like an animal had mauled it. I became completely deaf in that ear, with mild-moderate hearing loss in the ""good"" ear from Meniere's. As I get older I just lose more and more of my hearing.

Neurofibromatosis type 2, “benign” tumors on my auditory nerves

For me it’s Cogan’s Autoimmune Disease

The doctors don't know but it's progressively getting worse. Born extremely premature and was kinda a medical miracle at the time, do they think it's that. Didn't notice the hearing issue until grade 9, despite failing hearing tests given to all students in grade 5.

ear infection and then i forgot i was like 2

NF2 :))))

Ménière’s disease.

Over 100 documented ear infections.  Eventually lost about 85% at 3 years old.  I'm the only deaf person in my entire family.

It was assumed Ménière’s disease for a while, later found out it was autoimmune inner ear disease

We aren't sure, but I did get a little hearing back when we identified and started treating my rheumatoid arthritis

I'm not deaf or going deaf, but my mum is losing her hearing. She had grommets fitted when she was younger and has had various surgeries on her ears (again, when she was younger) due to her narrow ear canals. She still has glue ears occasionally and has tinnitus.

She was told when she was younger she would need hearing aids, but she's going to be 50 in a couple years and still hasn't gotten them despite her hearing rapidly deteriorating.

Good thing is me, herself, and my Nana (her mum) all know BSL. So even if she does lose her hearing completely, which I think she will, we have a way of communicating still.

Genetics, multiple ruptured eardrums, army.

actually born this way thanks to HOMER2 gene.

A combination of hereditary and ear infections.

My hearing loss is caused by EDS--Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a genetic connective tissue disorder. I started losing it when I was in my early 20s and has progressed over time (now almost 46).

Short answer, doctors don’t know. Mine just started down suddenly and kept dropping.

Born with a little hearing loss in my left ear, then my right. Ended up completely deaf by 3. 21/22 years later to find out it’s from rare genetic disorder; distal tubular acidosis. Only found that out after almost dying from sepsis due to not being able to pass kidney stones.

Covid

Untreated ear infections as a child :(

lost my hearing at couple months old at first they tried hearing aids but my hearing kept going worse and then I got cochlear implants at age 1 and the second at age 2 they say it was due to a infection I’m not entirely certain what the real cause was.

Jaundice

We assume autoimmune from the pattern of my hearing loss. It started at age 57 and 5 years later my audiologist advised there was nothing else hearing aids could do for me. Got that news 2 weeks ago - was tough, I thought I had 5 or 10 more until we got to this point, but I’m at Disability:IN this week and still managing with my crappy asl (still learning), captions etc. Bonus - the loud neighbors don’t bug me at night 😎

Bacterial meningitis at the age of 24. I often say when telling people how I lost my hearing “I spent a week in a coma. I woke up. My ears didn’t.”

I'm on this reddit bc of my hubby. 

He lost hearing in his left ear suddenly one day 10 years ago (he was in his 20s). Sudden sensinueral hearing loss. Steroid injections in the ear to retrieve a few decibels, but not functional. Then lost all his hearing in the right 2 years ago. Took steroid pills, and it came back in about 4 weeks. Then he lost it completely again this Jan. Hasn't returned. ENTs were very stumped. We saw 3 different ones. The last 2 believe it's from his type 1 diabetes as it was wildly out of control in his 20s.

Ménière’s disease showing up at around 10. Not genetic, never found out what caused it

Partial genetics (cookie bite), partial noise induced (military).

I know a small portion was from meningitis when i was 2 ... the rest however is up in the air ..  i have moderately severe to severe loss .. however i also have neurological issues and no voice so has been a helluva trip. Now am learning ASL and accepting my deaf identity in a way

Not sure. We think it's my rare form of EDS, but have no way to tell.

Glomus tympanicum ( paraganglioma) tumor in my right middle ear.  I have had 3 surgeries for it, it came back after the first 2 and I had some hearing loss after those surgeries.  I had the third surgery a month ago and this time the tumor was a lot bigger and they had to do a more invasive surgery.  I have nothing left inside my ear.   My ear drum is gone / ear canal closed up inside and I am deaf on that side.",2025-07-15 14:40:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m0jjhi/those_that_werent_born_deaf_what_caused_it/
1m0iwyp,deaf,Feeling overwhelmed (CI),"Just want to reach out here to see if anyone has any advice. I'm feeling very lost. I'm late Deafened and have profound SNH in both ears. I recently had a longggggg appointment to see if I'd be a good candidate for CI's after the appointment the Dr said I was a good candidate for bilateral CI's but now my ENT and that same Dr typed up notes saying the 2 hours of testing came back inconclusive. I'm confused and exhausted because that was a longggg day that was incredibly exhausting and it feels like I'm not getting all the information. When I tried to ask about it they said they are sending me for another test. (ABR). I guess I was just disappointed after them telling me one thing and how I'm doing another test. Has anyone else had this happen or something similar. Can I expect the ABR test to be equally exhausting? 

[댓글]
No, the ABR test is as easy as it gets, In fact you can literally sleep through it. They hook electrodes to your scalp and they play some noise in your ears and see what kind of brain response you get. It's not perfectly accurate but you can't fake it. 

If you're not getting all the information you need to suck it up and ask your doctor. Did you ask for more information when they said it was inconclusive?  Have you even had an MRI yet? Results from an MRI scan might disqualify you too, you don't know yet. 

I'm also late deafened like you and late last year I had the same kind tests and evaluations. The hearing test required by insurance was pretty much torture. I've been profoundly deaf for a while. I asked if I could just have an ABR test instead and my audiologist explained the test with a hearing aid was required for insurance approval but she had me do an ABR anyway, likely because you can't fake an ABR and it would confirm the severity of my hearing loss. 

The best advice I can give is to accept the reality that you may not be a candidate for a CI. You need to be comfortable in your own skin as a deaf person before you continue. Even if you get a CI you'll still be deaf.

Overwhelmed is accurate but not strong enough for what you experienced. It’s extremely hard to focus and identify issues after being put thru the wringer of testing, let alone having the doctor reverse their diagnosis without clearly explaining why! That is inexcusable! You are doing the right thing by taking a time out and asking for input. 
The doctor not wanting a new interpreter and brushing you off with instructions to use the portal was also inexcusable. All CI docs should be educated on the psychological aspects of going through this process. Sadly few are. But they should have patient/facing skills. Again, not all do. 
If you’re in the USA I recommend checking out the Hearing Loss Association of America to see if there is a chapter near you. The purpose of this organization is to help us all live with hearing loss and provide support through these experiences. They taught me self-advocacy and gave me the encouragement to practice it. 
Please check with the healthcare facility to see if they have Patient Advocates. Their services are free to patients, and while they work for the facility they also want to be sure providers are doing things right. 
Finally, summarizing your frustrations in a portal message, with questions such as “Why was my diagnosis changed?” And stating expectations for accommodations during future visits starts a paper trail that will help you keep on track and hopefully educate them. You’re doing great! Take your time at every step in this process to collect input, think things thru, and communicate your needs as clearly as possible. You are the customer and you deserve clear answers and explanations as well as respect in all interactions. Good luck and best wishes wherever your path takes you.

i have been through that ringer. i qualify and then disqualify (its a whole thing) and its EXHAUSTING. that said, ABR you actually are encouraged to sleep! for about an hour you just lay still and close your eyes. they put babies under anesthesia since they are unable to lay quiet and still on their own!

You only had one day of testing? We have several in my country 😊

(They actually set it up in a more patient friendly way with a series of appointments and specific time for feedback and discussions with the team members.)",2025-07-15 14:15:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1m0iwyp/feeling_overwhelmed_ci/

Good. Maybe then this issue can be addressed and we grow from it.

What even qualifies her for that position if she’s so ignorant about accessibility? Does she mock wheelchair ramps and seeing-eye dogs too? 🙄

Can't help but feel like she and her press secretary should have to navigate a few meetings either wearing custom ear plugs, or in ASL without anyone to interpret to English, and see what being thrown off really means. Deaf culture training does not at all seem like enough.

You can also pop over to r/ASLinterpreters and ask about reputable local agencies in your area who contract for these services. Depending on the assignment, it can sometimes be helpful to have virtual interpreters who are in your region.

Linguabee is a good online agency.

I've used a VOYCE (On-Demand Medical Interpretation Services) once, on a rolling monitor platform at one of our local hospitals.  It was 'ok'.  You've just got to arrange to have the speaker sit next to it so you can see both the onscreen 'terp and the speaker themselves at the same time.

I think it's RARELY unreasonable to ask for accommodations if you feel they will aid in your success. I know it's cliché, but the worst they can say is no!

Yes, you can get an interpreter. For class, they have you try using autocaptions first. Personally, I find CART more useful than an interpreter for class.

Start a conversation with the accommodation department. Many are willing to provide dual accommodations (CART and interpreter) for a few weeks to see which is best for you. You might love terps for English and History but prefer CART for algebra. Try a few at a time and find what works best for you.

1lz1g7o,deaf,DGS/German/English,"Shot in the dark here - anyone here fluent in DGS (German Sign), German, and English?  We are English speakers with a Deaf son in a country that uses DGS as official sign language. We need to learn both German and DGS, thinking - would it be crazy to try to do both at the same time?  Seems like it would accelerate the whole thing, but wondering if anyone could even teach it that way. 

Looking for resources and opinions, especially if there are any German signer/talker/English talkers out there. 

[댓글]
I think perhaps get into contact with a Deaf teacher. They could tailor methods for you as a family - thus being able to teach you DGS ""the Deaf way"", by immersion and pictures rather than ""the hearing way"" by comparing it to a spoken language.

You could also learn German at the same time separately.

Being taught a new language in a language you know is a crutch. It is helpful at first and feels easier - but often slows language acquisition, especially as you get progressively further into the process. The way that children learn languages is by soaking up vocabulary with context and spotting grammatical patterns organically - this works for adults too and is one of the best ways known to learn language (called Comprehensible Input).

There won't be much Comprehensible Input resources on the internet for DGS, but here is some for German: [Playlist PreA1/A1 | comprehensible input and TPRS Stories for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEILZcsYXfk&amp;list=PLTmlXg6IuS2cTv_hN_gL6M25tRjGoubc7)

I'm a DGS native, I'd be happy to answer all your questions. 

If you are going to live in Germany long term, then it should be possible to learn both German and DGS. I don't know how old your child is but if they go to school, they should have some resources for children with German/DGS as a second language.

Hello! Not DGS but I’m native BSL I grew up learning both English and British sign language at same time, how? my teacher of deaf taught me by showing signs, words and objects at same time. It’s definitely possible for ur kid to learn German and sign language around the same time, my advice is to learn DGS and German with him, you’ll both will gain knowledge and skills together!

Not a crazy thing to try to do! Multilingual kids often do much better in school especially if you start early. 

I would contact the local deaf school or the local deaf organization(s) to see if there are people who can help. 

I’ve also seen scenarios where families will have a deaf person or an interpreter stay as an au pair or similar arrangement that includes housing in exchange for teaching your family sign language and deaf culture

I moved to Spain and have found it challenging to learn both Castellano and LSE at the same time. But, I do think it could be combined well (like with muscle memory reinforcement!)

Mod note: This post regarding sign language has been approved due to the context provided.

I'm deaf and I grew up in Germany. Your best bet is to contact your local school for recommendations for your son. Sometimes they're mainstreamed. If you'd like to learn DGS and German at the same time to support your son, you should look into courses at the VHS. It's much easier if you can practise and learn together.

When boss says do this to get raise. I could totally miss it. Same thing in school. No overhearing students work out stuff together. Which they totally do yes.

When I was working as a nurse assistant, I often got scolded for not doing things I was told to do. When I explained I didn't hear them they'd say "" tell me when you didn't hear"" for context I knew they were talking I just masked so well, made all the right facial expressions as if I heard , I just missed key info regularly.

I once went and relaxed in the break room. I took my lunch break late so nobody else was there. Took my hearing aids out and relaxed. An hour later, went back to my desk and the floor was empty. So apparently there was a fire alarm ringing….

I haves research degree and good job, and most things that are an obstacle are that people often have interesting discussions in meetings, that I could contribute to due to my experience and competence, but since I can’t hear the details of the discussions, even with tools like Phonak table mics, it becomes impossible for me to really contribute in a good way. When working with close colleagues, it’s less of a problem, and they always provide good meeting minutes. While when meeting external partners, it’s just impossible to work the way I would want to work.

Not hearing well also becomes a problem when other aspects of communication are unclear. For example, I was at the ER, pretty sick, they didn’t need to keep me at hospital, but I did need treatment somewhat urgently. The problem was that the department I should go to was closed on Sundays, so I had to return the next day. They couldn’t make an appointment, since it was closed, but promised some would contact me on the Monday morning to make arrangements the appointment. I had an interpreter at the ER, and naturally I would love to arrange thing there and then. Unfortunately, I didn’t get any call in the morning (which also would have been a problem) and, since I needed the treatment, I had to spend tons of time on TTY trying to get in touch with the right clinic. This would have been messy for hearing people too, but when not hearing, it just becomes so incredibly more cumbersome with additional risks for miscommunication.

Why are you inquiring?

My biggest issue currently as a profoundly deaf person who doesn't sign, is that as my vulnerable mother's POA I am unable to get appropriate accommodations from her nursing home. I cannot have meetings about her care, I need CART to understand. They have refused and claimed it's not financially responsible for them to provide CART. 

The nursing home insists I'll be ""fine"" with the Otter app. I own Otter and know its limitations, plus I tried it during meetings there already, it failed awfully in the group situations. 

I feel like there's a big gap in assisting deaf caregivers, and I'm at my wits end because the legal team at this big nursing home conglomerate has flat out refused to accommodate me because they don't want to accommodate anyone else, either. They hide behind their ""religious"" affiliation as a way to skirt the access laws. 

I'm in MN, I wonder what will happen to me when it's my time to go to a nursing home. Will I be totally isolated and my needs for communication access ignored, too? The current situation of not being able to discuss mom's care has made me sick and traumatized. I'm made out to be the uncooperative bad guy because I won't roll over and accept them treating me like a child and choosing my (inappropriate) accommodations for me. 

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of discrimination from a nursing home?

I'd say the worst situations have been when the missed information resulted in death, such as fire alarms, CO2 alarms, or police encounters. I fortunately haven't experienced these myself, but I'm always very alert to these dangers.

My biggest issues are in medical contexts: not understanding what to do before a procedure, not understanding test results or symptoms to watch out for, things like that. I’m in medical situations a lot and also have a language barrier, on top of hearing loss, and it can lead to serious delays in proper treatment.

1lygwf2,deaf,Do all of you still enjoy music? 🎶,"I had cochlear implants since I was 2 as I was born deaf. I’m pretty fluent in my speech and can hear decent but one thing is I can’t comprehend the purpose of music as I don’t find any enjoyment about the “lyrics” and “sounds”. I don’t mind it when my family and friends plays it in the car and whenever but it’s something i wouldn’t care for in my alone time, I’d enjoy sitting in silence with my processors off.

What is all of your opinions on music?

[댓글]
YES. 

No HAs or CIs. 

I'm profoundly and severely deaf depending on the ear. 

I work with music and instruments for a living!

Funny story when I first got hearing aids I had a work van I’d usually drive around with the classic rock station on. Styx “Sail Away” came and the opening melody is the exact same as the sound my hearing aids would make when the batteries are about to die, but i had just changed the batteries an hour earlier. Completely new to hearing aids, I started bugging out hearing the melody knowing i just changed the batteries.

Your point of view is understandable. I'm post lingually deaf and have not been able to enjoy music since 2005. I got implanted back in November and let me tell you, music is not natural with a CI. 


I have not been able to enjoy new music, at least not yet, though I get some enjoyment from songs I'm already familiar with. The pitch and timbre of vocals are wrong and often horns don't sound right or even enjoyable. (I tried listening to some classic Jazz on YouTube and it was intolerable).


There are a couple of songs I remember that I've been unable to enjoy, I suspect due to the way the processor handles noise, but I switch to ""music mode"" and it's not much better.

Had cochlear implants since I was a baby - I *love* music, but I’m only really interested in musicals and filk and whatnot - I like stuff that has a plot and characters, (that continues throughout the entire album), stories that tug at my heartstrings, and also sci-fi/fantasy stuff - generic songs don’t really hold much appeal to me, and I also don’t really notice background music in parties and stores and stuff


Also I can’t pick out instrumental lietmotifs for the life of me

I'm similar to you and used to feel the same about music - your problem is you're trying to enjoy music like a hearing person not embracing it the Deaf way. Trying to understand lyrics and subtle sounds is never gonna be fun - but feeling the beat is awesome. Forgot about doing music like you're 'meant to' and just enjoy what you experience. I love music now because I've chosen to enjoy it in the way that's natural for me

Severe-to-Profound, HA 
I love music but I am very picky in that some music just drowns out everything and becomes noise. I prefer more slow music

Never did care for it until I found the music that’s right for me and my Deafness. I like low bassy deep music as I can’t hear high frequencies. My favourite music artist is Massive Attack.

Yep! It’s all about finding the right kind of music to enjoy.

I like controlling what I can hear when available, so I’ve just spent a lot of time finding what kind of music plays well with my hearing loss. (For me, it’s a lot of types of metal, especially doom and black.)

Yes Love Music!! Hate the TV! With my newest aids, all that vibration is gone. I still have to read the words. 
Apple Haptics is the bomb! And I just got into drumming 🪘 found a new circle of drummers who except me and my deaf friends who join me ~my rhythm is in the process of learning the beat. And I love dancing. With the drum circle the ground vibrates. 🙌🏻🙌🏻✌️🤙🏻🤘

I had sudden hearing loss and feel like I've lost music.  I seem to do ok with single instruments and simple melodies.  I know I'm missing chords and harmonies. Something is better than nothing but it feels like watching black and white TV instead of watching color.

[deleted]

I love music, listen to it all the time. I grew up listening to music since I was little. I noticed that with my hearing aids, I can hear certain parts of a song that I couldn’t hear without my hearing aids. For example backing vocals/ lyrics in the background of other lyrics, beats that were a lower tones. I also look a song lyrics while listening to songs sometimes so I can understand what is being sung as sometimes I can miss hear something in a song. I will always enjoy music.

I'm profound deaf and yes i enjoy music. i have hearing aids but i never wear them bc it doesnt do much for me. but i love musicals, unique artists that have style different from most mainstream artist. i like death metal also. ive always loved music. not sure why i just do.

Hi, I'm fully deaf in both ears and have a cochlear implant, had them since I was 1 year old, I'm actually the opposite, though I do like the silence too, I actually like music, I listen to a lot of them in my spare time, most genres too.

No. 1 HA, 1 
cI. Cannot listen to music. I can hear Classical or instrumental but there are low and high spots I can’t hear or don’t want to hear.

I find music after losing hearing not as enjoyable as music before. I just figured this out. I can’t often hear words but sounds yes. So I always say there is a radio in my head. I hear music ai know without hearing words I know from past.

Mostly music I liked from before my CI, but a decent amount of new stuff too. 

Personally through, what is bigger for me is background music in movie/tv/games. It's not required to like a program, but it adds so much. Like playing the scene from the climax of a story with and without the background adore is night and day different. It makes the emotional highs and lows hit so much harder.

CI has helped me perceive the fluidity of classical music and string quartets, which I enjoy (I had zero appreciation of music before the surgery). Popular music… not so much.

Yes I love it. It brings me lots of joy or nostalgia if it’s an older song. If I’m listening to a new song I would google the lyrics because if I don’t it all sounds like it’s smashed together. My hearing loss is moderate to moderate severe depending on the ear

I love dancing so music is key to this. I love beats and to move!

I was born deaf and have also had CIs since I was 2. I love music, but I’m particular with it—needs to have good lyrics/story I can follow along with, as listening to new songs can be a bit more difficult for me. I don’t go out of my way to listen to new music but when I do, I put my entire focus on it to listen to the sound, lyrics, pitches, etc. before I can really register it if that makes sense, and then I’ll recognize the song anywhere. 

Maybe you just haven’t found the right artists or music genre? When I was in high school, I watched a lot of MTV back when it actually showed music videos, and that was how I discovered so much new music and favorite artists I still follow to this day. The visual stimulation really helps me to follow along so much better!

Born Deaf and never really cared for music.

However, my friend's argument, to be able to talk to as many people, who might have interesting knowledge, as possible, is pretty good as well.

So, it'd be cool to get some insight in this subject and learn some more about sign languages in general.

There is an international sign system for international Deaf gatherings but it's not a complete language.

I would suggest you start with your local sign language and try your best to find local events to hang out with the community. You will learn the fastest from them

Sign languages develop in much the same way as any other real language, as such there's no such thing as a universal sign language.

only place i know of is online in vrchat lol most people there knows VR adapted ASL. rarely do anyone knows other than that.

Not really. Like maybe enough to get help if others are familiar with it (less likely than regional languages). Otherwise you're looking at about 300 distinct sign languages in the world. There are languages that share overlaps like Japan, Korea and a few other areas, mostly due to catholic missionaries, but have become more different after WWII. 

And within various countries there may be different nuances with in the same language. Also in the US there's both American Sign Language as well as SEE / Sign Exact English, the latter seems to be used by people who learn signing later in life and is pretty much English grammar in sign. 

As someone else mentioned, even DGS has different regional differences.",2025-07-12 18:03:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ly6vlz/is_there_a_world_sign_language/
1ly16u8,deaf,A genuine question so can actually do some good,"Edit- I am doing a ton of research whilst doing this, I found Deaf Advocates but still need to learn more.

I am not Hard of Hearing or Deaf. I live in Rochester, with the Highest number of Deaf/HoH people in the country. Last year I was going to College for ASL, but realized that being an interpreter is too precise for me. What I did find was a deep respect and admiration of that community and a rage at how the world has treated people in it. Especially kids.

So I redirected my thoughts, and now I am going for Human Services Associates degree ( To start) and aim to help that community as best I can. Not in a hero way, but in a human way. I will be taking Asl classes, to afford at least basic communication and will be doing my best to help as best I can.

I am telling you this for advice. Are there things to avoid, encourage, studies that are great helps... I want to make a difference and really help. Your community is one that deserves that respect, so I aim to do my best.

Edit- It was pointed out that I wasn't being really direct, so here is the question-

My question is this- How can I be the best advocate, especially for Deaf/HOH children? I want to help kids get access to good educations, job potential and more. I want to make sure they are literate and able to advocate for themselves as well. They deserve and equitable playing field and I think I can help with that. So, I ask, how can I get started in a way that really does good and is wasting no one's time?



Thank you for anything you can do to help, even if that is to direct me to a better Reddit to post this on.

Thank you.

P.S. I will go for my bachelors, but I learn much better with field work than just classwork...

Edit- I really am not trying to be a hero, I know from personal experience how demeaning and unhelpful that is... I just want to do some good for a community that i respect a lot. Thank you.

MAJOR EDIT0

I am not thinking ASL is a basic language, all Sign Languages are beautiful, complex and well developed. What I was trying to explain is that i cannot simcom, that is too precise for me. The wires cross and that is a huge part of interpreteting. I am far too aware that it is not enough to have basics, I even said I was going to continue to learn more ASl and Deaf Culture in college, I live in Rochester, the resources are there.

I have only one semester of ASL skill, I want to have far more before i enter the work force. This is why I am asking for help, so I know precisely how to make the most out of my time so I CAN be the best fit for this community. I have time, that is the point.

To be concise, my goal is to take my four Human services courses per semester and then an Asl elective to round it out. This includes deaf studies... I am not taking this lightly.

I hope to be the best fit to help those I respect and can see myself being a good help... this is not a light goal. I am going all in. Heck I want to take ASL course in my bachelors as well...

The reason I am getting my Associates first is to get into a Deaf led organization and get my feet wet, to keep my skills up and more. Signing as part of my job, working in that community would be paramount ot mastering the language and understanding the culture.

What is your question?  I honestly have no idea what you are asking for. This is like meeting someone new, and they tell you their life story. Which is fine, it's lovely to know your background. But what is your 'genuine question'?

1ly0oko,deaf,Deaf Perspectives: Films on deafness made with deaf young people,"Hope this is ok to post here.

I have been working on a project with deaf and hearing young people in Suffolk to make short films exploring different aspects of deaf life.

We have made films on the past and present of deaf education, being deaf at university, being deaf at work, the campaign for a BSL GCSE, top tips for hearing people, a BSL performance, and the evolution of hearing technology.

All films are subtitles and available with BSL.

If anyone would like to watch them they are on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhy22vs_XD686_PM7-cIsLdt71g6AwyWq&amp;si=K63cvGPPxaLgHkF3

Voice control and modulation is a very difficult skill for us deafies. Feedback is very subtle to read. Even in a relatively quiet surroundings.

No, because I can’t lip read.

Same - doesn't help that I grew up in a pub because a lot of them *could* lipread/communicate non-verbally, it's a handy skill behind a bar.

I forget this all the damn time. I swear, drunk frat boys thought it was the coolest party trick to lip read 😂😂

Tbh, the hearing people I’ve known have always been better lip readers than me! Might help that they get more practice and auditory feedback.

the gems for me are the ones who try and repeat something to me, and i'm horrified that they can't hear me as well as i thought. or my voice is garbled from (pandemic) years of literal disuse apart from toddler conversations 🥴🤣💅

1lwdkhw,deaf,Best family ASL resources?,"Again thanks to all for the help in my previous question about parenting with hearing loss. 

I am 45,a mother of 5 kids homeschooling in a very rural area. I have progressive hearing loss. I lost 30 dB on my audiogram in 2 years and my ENT is talking about CIs in the near future. I'm on the fence about them, but regardless of my ultimate choice, more or less full deafness appears to be in my future. 

I've been using Lifeprint to learn ASL for nearly a year and I have a good friend who's doing it with me. My husband and kids are basically learning from me (fraught with pitfalls, teaching as a learner, I know, and that's part of why I'm here). I love ASL and tbh compared to using hearing aids and still not understanding speech all that well (while being overwhelmed with ambient noise in a house) I feel it works really well for us. It clarifies things that are voiced and sometimes it's just an enormous relief to not be TRYING to hear. Also, as a family we can get better at ASL. I can't get better at hearing. 

My question: are there resources available for families like ours to learn together? What suggestions do you have for us doing this better? I'm just trying to envision us continuing to homeschool as my hearing deteriorates, and of course we'll adjust course as makes sense for everyone. But I think we could be proactive and everyone learns ASL and gets the perks of a second language...or, we get very frustrated trying to cope with all this and homeschooling disintegrates and disaster ensues (disaster being my kids don't get the really high quality education full of opportunities we dreamed of).

1lvs82y,deaf,Deaf/Hearing Parenting Roles," My husband is Deaf and I am hearing, and we’re expecting our first baby this September. As we prepare to become parents, I find myself feeling a bit anxious about the dynamics of communication—particularly in situations where our child might act out before developing strong signing skills. I’m concerned that I may end up being the default disciplinarian or primary teacher simply because I can communicate verbally, and hear my child speak. I’m looking for insight and guidance: how do Deaf parents typically handle things like defiance or hitting in those early years, before a child is fluent in sign? Any tips or experiences would be deeply appreciated.

[댓글]
I’m deaf/HoH and my husband is hearing. The poster above is correct — it is so much easier for babies to pick up sign language before learning to speak. This is due to the fact that hand dexterity develops before oral skills /vocal stuff is developed.

My hearing son was able to communicate with me before he was 12 months old. Now at 2 years old, his speech abilities are stronger than his signing abilities but that’s because he’s enrolled in a hearing daycare facility (no one knows ASL) and I simply-com with him (speak and sign at the same time). If I was better about only signing, my son might have retain med more of his ASL vocabulary.

All that being said… Deaf parents sign with their children just like hearing parents talk with their children even before the child can communicate back. It’s all a part of language  modeling and language development and how parents interact with their children. Hearing and Deaf parents use language and gestures when communicating with pre-lingual children.

Children typically develop manual dexterity before the fine oral motor skills required for speech. They can produce some basic signs before most spoken words - hence the popularity of “baby sign language” classes. The odds that your kid’s English fluency will precede his signing fluency are low.

How do you handle these things before they learn English? 

I have 3 kids (all hearing) and from the start I've been the primary disciplinarian. 

I can't say how it'll be handled in your home because everyone handles things differently, but I can tell you, you and your husband will need to work as a team and not separate people working alone.

It's a trade off. I couldn't hear my babies/ kids if they were in another room. We had an open floor plan so they were pretty much in my line of sight all the time. Kids climb and get into stuff often, without making noise.  I saw a lot of potential accidents about to happen and was able to intervene because I was also paying attention and watching out of the corners of my eyes. Relying on hearing means that you don't hear the kid crying till after they hurt themselves. In some way, hearing parents seemed a bit negligent to me because they missed a lot of stuff That said, if I left my kids unattended or the room was dark, I couldn't rely on my sight and could appear negligent to hearing parents. 
Example: I always put my kids down to nap in whatever room I was working in so I'd be there when they woke up. I can't tell you how many times other parents would tell me they hear their babies when they wake up so they left them alone for long periods of time and they one day they're shocked when the kid woke, climbed out of the crib/ off the bed and got into something without making noise. One.friend  caught the baby at the top of the stairs, they hadn't put the baby gate up yet because they thought the baby couldn't crawl much yet. 
The downside was I was always watching the kids and that made other tasks a bit harder to do. But the upside was my babies got a lot of attention and care.

Your husband will notice when your child is upset and start communicating with your kid in ASL before your child can speak English and how do you know your child will be hearing anyways? It might be smart to revise your question. It comes off as patronizing your Deaf husband. Who is obviously a capable enough adult to have gotten on in life. Lots of Deaf people raise children, even hearing ones, really well...that's who all the people on this sub that have the flair for CODA are, children of Deaf adults. I only recently made my first Deaf friend about 3 months ago and I still have a lot to learn about Deaf culture and I'm not trying to say I don't make mistakes at all but just reading your post gave me the ick. I don't want your husband or your baby to not get support or advice because you didn't realize how to ask better questions. So this is my advice. Do research on how to be a Deaf parent or hearing Co-parent. Purchase some of the tools and resources to make it so your child rearing experience with your husband is great and don't assume you'll be a better parent just because you hear ever again. Maybe find some books. Independently without putting that responsibility on Deaf redditors.

I’m a Deaf parent to hearing kids and have a hearing spouse. My strong recommendation: always sign when your husband is around if you want your kids to have a strong relationship with him. Don’t fall into the trap of being their interpreter, they need to communicate with each other. They may learn English slightly later than their peers, but that is not a negative. There is tons of English exposure: school, out in public, hearing relatives, media etc. Tons. Make ASL the primary language in your home and that will solve a majority of your concerns.

1lvqocx,deaf,I don't know how to handle phone calls. Vent/advice needed,"I fall under the hard of hearing category based on my audiogram (moderate in one ear, moderate/severe in the other), and I have auditory processing disorder. I've never really known how to identify because I feel more deaf than I am, if that makes sense? Like enough sound makes it to my ear that I'm not deaf, but the state of it is so garbled and messed up that I rely heavily on ASL, writing, and lipreading to move about the world. I was born hearing, and started slowly losing it in middle school. Everyone in my life is hearing and nobody knows ASL. I'd love for that to change but I'm awkward around new people and I can't force people to learn a whole new language.

I'm still able to speak on the phone. Kinda. I hate it and every conversation takes about three times longer than it should because I'm constantly asking people to repeat themselves or rephrase things. It's gotten to the point where my voicemail now says ""I'm deaf. Please text me at this number or email me at myemail@website.com."" but sometimes your doctor's office calls you and they can't text or email and you gotta get on the phone. I can't stand it. People get so frustrated with me but I genuinely can't understand what's being said. I hear maybe two words out of a sentence, and I'm never too sure that I'm right about what's being said. If the person has an accent, you can forget about it. I typically just ask a family member to handle my phone calls. Either making them, or when I have to talk to someone I'll put the phone on speaker and they'll repeat what's being said for me to lipread because my family is genuinely easier for me to understand.

But then my family also tries to call me and it's still hard. I understand them easier than anyone else just due to knowing their speaking patterns and common phrases, but I feel like they should know better than to even try, you know? It's not the same as speaking to them face to face. It's not a secret that I can't hear and hate the phone, they should be able to understand that. My mom still knocks on my door and gets mad when I don't answer for fifteen minutes like I was deliberately leaving her outside instead of.. I don't know... unable to hear the knocking. They have heard me say ""I understand you easier than strangers"" and I guess taken it to mean ""I'm not deaf with you"" for some reason?

I might need to bite the bullet and just get a video phone and an accessible doorbell. I'm open to the doorbell, but the video phone feels like a major step that I'm apprehensive to take. For one, I happen to like my current phone. For two, my family would panic at hearing another voice through the phone. For three, I don't know it just feels like I'm acting more deaf than I am? Like... I felt guilty getting an interpreter for school because I talk like a hearing person, but my grades were suffering due to the mask mandate and COVID. I'm also not fond of the idea of setting one up, it just feels weird. I don't really know how to articulate it. I don't like being perceived and it's a lot easier to get an unexpected call when nobody can see you, I guess. I always feel weird using accessibility services because I feel like they're meant for people who are profoundly deaf, which I'm not (and don't portray myself as). I've had an interpreter call me out for this before and it really caused something of a complex when it comes to accomodations. I don't like using them but I really do think some of these things would help me out immensely.

I suppose I'm asking for others' experiences with VRS. Especially people who have the experience with both voice calls and video calls. Was it helpful? What was the installation like? Was it an adjustment? How did people in your life react? Also weirdly I think I'm asking for permission? Like... based on my description does it sound like I'm deaf enough to get one? I'm sorry if that last question is weird, again I have a bit of a complex and I don't want to take a resource away from someone who might need it more.

Why are you bending yourself to accommodate everyone in your life? 

You are deaf.  It’s time to make adaptive and access changes in your life, nothing embarrassing or guilty to feel about. I call out your family ableism that is making your life as a Deaf person that much harder when they should be working with you in access being easier. 

You can get Videophone and use VCO (voice carry over) meaning you still have option to talk your own but rely on interpreter when it’s other caller’s turn to speak. 

Either that or use captiontell.

Why don't you use a captioned phone system like InnoCaption?

Get the devices/services they are a game changer. 

I mostly use TTY on my cellphone and use WhatsApp or Zoom for calls.

When I was younger, we had a VTech phone at home, and the school had a Cisco.

Will taking calls using air pods? I have moderate loss in my “telephone” ear. It works when it needs too. More doctors offices are texting now.

If you’re interested in VRS, Purple/ZVRS offers a VCO feature (voice carry over) meaning you can speak for yourself and the interpreter will not voice for you they will only will interpret what the other person is saying. I’m very certain you can get the video phone on your smart phone you have now and you wouldn’t really need to change much you may have a special VRS phone number that you can give to doctors or family so they can contact you. From what I’m reading I think VRS will help a ton and you can totally speak for yourself don’t need to rely on interpreter voicing for you. Hoping this helps 😊🤟

The phone calls part is easy, most relay service will offer an option where the relay officer types the other side of the call and you can talk like normal.


Your relationship to your accomodations sounds really complicated though, which is totally normal, especially since you've had some bad experiences with it in the past. I think it would help a lot to find a professional to work through them with and help you come up with some more helpful things to say to yourself 💚💚

I use: 

CaptionCall
Nagish

If you have iphone, you can use live transcribe for calls.

If you video chat, Google meets has a  captioning feature.

You’re under no obligation to take phone calls! I personally refuse to answer the phone - email exists and so does text messaging. It’s not complicated for people to contact you without a phone call.

There are relay services for when you absolutely have to ring someone but in most cases just be firm about your needs. I switched audiologists because they used to always ring me, despite asking them to email.

I use 2 phones sometimes , one with Google transcribe, and it works brilliantly

Video phones only help if you know sign language. In the US, you’re able to sign up for InnoCaption or an IP relay.",2025-07-09 18:41:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lvqocx/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_phone_calls_ventadvice/
1lvbl89,deaf,"It finally happened. Today, a hearing person asked me if I knew Braille.","I've read stories of d/Deaf/HoH people getting accommodations that have nothing to do with our deafness, like some of us getting wheelchairs or Braille menus, but I was like ""there's no way that actually happens.""

This guy quickly repeated himself more loudly which distracted me from my girlfriend's signing so now I couldn't understand either of them.

I tried to keep the conversation smooth by telling him about how we have a Braille printing machine at my job and it cost my company about $20,000 to get it. He asked about Hawaiian Sign Language and if it was different from ASL. It was a normal grocery trip but I've never had someone ask me about knowing Braille. 😅

When I was first contemplating becoming an interpreter, my friend who was a professional told me how frequently other hearing people asked her whether she knew Braille. 

I didn’t really believe her. 

Then I became an interpreter…and I found out. Oh my god. She had not exaggerated at all. 😆

I remember my first time. Church member had an arm full of scriptures in Braille so excited to show me. Then looked so dismayed when I let them know I have no idea how to use them. The member ending with “But can you try” was really the cherry on top of that. I know my face was like 😳.

Lol! Hearing people in general are so ridiculous. It’s like their brains suddenly go smooth when they encounter something they have been so sheltered from. There were times when I got a menu… in braille. WTF? 🤣

As I was interpreting for a Dr and a Deaf client the Dr stopped their entire conversation and said “wow you read lips so well! You’re understanding everything that I am saying!” AS I WAS SIGNING. 🤪

Went to the airport one time, told them I was Deaf. They asked if I needed a wheelchair.  Good times....

I have a blind friend at church, sometimes I help him walk into the sanctuary. I’m HOH, so I tell folks, we’re Hellen Keller!

Reminds me of a few of my most memorable responses to my cochlear implant:  At a grocery store, I once had a woman who had a little kid in the grocery cart.  She saw my implant and had a look of horror on her face and hurried to the next aisle.  Another time, I had a guy who saw my cochlear implant and asked me what phone plan I had because it looked cool.

Bahahahaha

I’ve been asked if I *speak* Braille! 😭

This has been a hilarious read.

I once got told I could get audio description devices for a theater performance. I had asked for open captioning, since I’m deaf.

Who needs critical thinking? /s

I would reply can you sign?

I’m deaf and can totally laugh about this..

i’ve been asked this before, and the funny part is that i actually do know (some) braille

😂😂😂😂

Wow. I never thought hearing people would ask such a question. I've been deaf in my left ear since birth and only recently found out I was losing hearing in my right. I wonder how my reaction will be if someone asks that. Lol will I laugh or am I going to give them a confused look with a raised eyebrow. I mean, I am slowly losing my vision when I'm already legally blind in one eye. But I dont read braille.

Do they think we're all Helen Keller? Lol you know I'm not sure she read braille. I just know about the palm signing part and how she lost her vision and hearing. I have seen an interview of her though.

That's for blind people not deadf people or hard of hearing people.

I once had cashier handing me an Braille menu when I asked for paper and pen

I literally saw a deaf family once in my life. I will never forget it. They were ahead of us at a Thomas the Train event using the parking meter. I was so stunned and in awe. They were all using sign.

I work at a renaissance faire in the summer. I can only wear my hearing aid for a few hours at a time there because the ambient noise is so loud and so constant. I get that woozy, almost motion sickness feeling because there's no place for me to go on a regular basis to be exposed to that level of noise. 

Last Saturday was opening day and the temps were in the 90s (Fahrenheit) and humidity was off the charts. I wore my HAs for about 45 minutes and suddenly became very dizzy. Popped them out and had almost instant relief. I did not try to wear them for the rest of the day. (everyone there is really cool about my hearing and it wasn't a huge issue).

Yep! My headache just goes away

Do none of you have tinnitus that roars back when you take your HA out?

I have tinnitus that I hear with my CIs on as well as off. The volume varies depending on how tired I am. Very tired = very loud. But after being in zoom or In Person meetings Silence is Golden. I get that in my house because my do and cat are wonderfully quiet company and I don’t turn on the TV. Bliss!",2025-07-08 22:33:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lv2gso/relief/
1lunkg7,deaf,"Peer support for parents of deafened children, teens and adults. Personal experience.","Hi everyone. 

I have been nearly deaf since childhood and have been wearing a hearing aid for 40+ years. I have learned to speak quite coherently and adequately and have gone a long way towards normal socialization, higher education and much more. I have developed into a completely normal, adequate person and am a prime example of the fact that being deaf is not a judgment.

I am familiar with many of the psychological and everyday problems of a person who is hard of hearing. At the same time, I do not know and do not use sign language and have lived all my life among normal, hearing people. Such a “trickster”. A person between the world of the deaf and the world of the hearing.

I am sometimes approached for Peer Support by parents of children who have just learned of their child's diagnosis. Or young people who have become deaf suddenly after an illness (especially after a pandemic) who need support in the first moments of the situation.

Usually, parents of such children or adults who are suddenly deafened do not know where to go or what to do. They do not understand how to be, how to deal with their child or how to behave in certain situations. Suddenly deafened people become nervous, withdrawn and stop wearing hearing aids, thinking it is ugly and stigmatizing. This situation is sometimes even worse with teenagers (I've been there). And if they don't have people around them to help them through this difficult period, they will have a much harder time as adults.

If you know someone who needs help, you can recommend me. I am ukrainian, speaking russian, ukrainian or english (through an interpreter). I am not a medical professional. I share my experience and support in the niche of psycho-social adaptation and hearing aid destigmatization. You can call it coaching or something else.

I have a lot of experience in design. I'm a designer and have worked with major American execs, corporations, and had my own businesses. This has helped me to look at stigma in terms of advantage rather than ugliness. To look at hearing aids as an accessory and a “thing” rather than just a medical device. To find things in the situation that are my advantages rather than disadvantages. That's something I talk about too, with those who want to figure it out.

Most importantly, I have lived it, live it, and understand this world of the hearing impaired person. This experience is not available to doctors or consultants in clinics, who are good hearing aid specialists, but who have a very distant idea of the real, everyday life of the hearing impaired or deaf and the socialization problems they face. This applies to a child's first steps in life and socialization at school, university, career guidance. It's about relationships among other things. It's also about the pain of wearing hearing aids, complexes, withdrawal, loneliness and fear of the future. And much more.

Thank you for reading this post.

It's the best way to advocate. If you're white and male. Then white and female. Especially if you look like you have money. 

That aside...

Straight out stating your needs in a way that you recognize that they're supposed to provide it and likely just didn't know. Give them an out for their ignorance..

""I'm sorry, I just need an interpreter, it's really tough for me to hear (while looking at them with strained eyes and ears). I realise it's a bit of a challenge finding one. Do you want me to handle that part and you handle the administrative costs?""

Look confused, tired and trying to meet them halfway there. It really puts them on the spot and afraid they'll get sued. It seems to work even in writing..don't make it a demand, just a matter of fact. 

If it doesn't work and you know they have to provide... Ie hospital or school, just look disappointed and ask for their HR info for your lawyer, as well as their info. Get it, and leave looking dejected. Don't give them the ability to say you were rude and combative. HR reallllllllly hates it when this situation occurs because they know how screwed they are when the lawyers come.

1lujyvp,deaf,"Howard Rosenblum, Former NAD CEO, is Running for Congress!","Hi r/deaf, Helen here.

Two weeks ago, Howard Rosenblum announced that he is running for Congress.

Later that week, I was hanging out with some friends, and we talked about his announcement. I made a comment: if there’s any one deaf person who can do this, it’s him.

Over the past couple of weeks, I realized this is something I should bring to the community. I checked the subreddit and was a bit surprised that no one had posted about it yet.

So I decided to spend a night digging into it and writing up a proper post. I want to share what I’ve come to understand about this moment and what it might mean.

Here goes.

#Context

Put simply, Howard Rosenblum is a deaf lawyer from Chicago. He’s best known for serving as the CEO of the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) for, I believe, nearly 15 years. I think the exact number is around 13.

Let’s pause for a moment.

As someone who posts in r/deaf, I’ve always written with a specific audience in mind; the deaf community members who may not be deeply connected to the culturally big-D Deaf world. That’s why I tend to go out of my way to explain who’s who in the community.

That said, when it comes to Howard Rosenblum, he’s arguably one of the most well-known Deaf figures in the United States right up there with celebrities like Marlee Matlin or social media personalities like Alex Abenchuchan. So if you’re not familiar with him, a quick Google search should give you a good sense of who he is.

Still, I want to highlight a few of his most notable achievements to give readers a clear picture of his work and impact.

#Howard’s Greatest Hits

During Howard’s years as NAD’s CEO, there are three major accomplishments he is best known for. These will likely be remembered as some of the most important parts of his legacy.

##Netflix

Howard successfully sued Netflix in the early 2010s to require captions for all of its streaming content.

This had a major impact on how accessibility is understood in the digital space. Howard argued that online platforms should be treated the same as physical “public accommodations” that are legally required to provide access for people with disabilities.

This was a landmark case. It helped pave the way for captions on other platforms like Hulu, Amazon, and Apple.

It’s fair to say that Howard is a big reason why streaming content is accessible today.

##Trump’s White House and COVID-19

Howard also successfully sued the Trump administration to require American Sign Language interpreters during emergency broadcasts at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Remember all the CDIs we saw on national television during those briefings? We can thank Howard for that.

This victory is also a key part of his campaign messaging. He’s putting a strong focus on the slogan: “I fought Trump and won.”

Hell yeah.

##Miguel Luna Perez v. Sturgis Public Schools

This is my personal favorite of Howard’s accomplishments.

In short, Miguel was a deaf child who immigrated to Michigan when he was nine. His school assigned him an educational aide who barely knew any sign language. For years, this aide made up signs and provided little meaningful support. Despite that, Miguel was led to believe he was progressing, based on feedback from his IEP team.

That illusion collapsed when the school informed him, just before graduation, that he would not receive a diploma but only a “certificate of completion.”

His family sued the school district, and the case eventually reached the Supreme Court. The Court ruled 9–0 in Miguel’s favor.

That outcome is remarkable, especially from our current conservative-majority court. Howard and his legal team argued that Miguel had been denied meaningful access to education, and the justices agreed.

This case stands out to me because I grew up in a mainstreamed setting too. I believe it has the potential to raise standards across the country. If that happens, the outcome of this case could improve the lives of thousands of deaf students in the years to come.

#Howard’s Congress Campaign

I really like Howard. I’m a big fan. I think he’s a very bright person.

I’ve met him multiple times, and these weren’t just casual hellos. I’ve collaborated with him on several occasions. I’ve had dinner with him. I’ve attended multi-day conferences where he represented NAD and spent time with him and other deaf professionals.

So, when I heard his announcement, I was excited. Naturally, I wanted to learn more about the race he’s entering and what the environment looks like.

Here’s what I found.

Howard is running for the congressional seat in Illinois’ Ninth District.

This district covers the northern part of the Chicago area. It stretches from the Lake Michigan shoreline westward into the suburbs, touching parts of three counties: Cook, Lake, and McHenry. The district represents a population of about 743,000 people.

The seat is open because Jan Schakowsky, who has served as the district’s representative since 1999, recently announced that she will retire at the end of her current term.

What stood out to me right away was that this is a district that’s part urban and part suburban… in the third largest city in the country.

What does that mean?

Competition. A very competitive field.

I have to admit, when I first heard that Howard was running for Congress, I assumed and quietly hoped that he would run in a more rural district, where competition might be less intense. My thinking was that his resume, as a lawyer and civil rights leader, would stack up well against candidates whose experience might be more local or limited to smaller communities.

I wouldn’t say I was disappointed to find out he’s running in the Ninth District. That would overlook his agency in choosing where and how to run. And “disappointed” isn’t really the right word anyway. The truth is, I would love to see someone like Howard in the U.S. Congress. Imagine what kind of change could happen with someone like him leading the charge for disability rights on the national stage.

So naturally, my next step was to look into who he’s up against.

#Howard’s Competitors

On paper, Howard is running against nine candidates in District 9.

Two of them are Republicans. Since the district is solidly blue, I’m going to ignore those two entirely. That leaves Howard with seven competitors.

Looking at the overall field of Democratic candidates in this race, there are eight in total, but from what I can gather, only four of them have a significant public presence or track record. Based on that, I’m going to use my judgment and assume these four are the most serious contenders. They are: Daniel Biss, Laura Fine, Kat Abut, and Bushra Amiwala.

Let me go off on a quick tangent.

These four that I’ve named have a wikipedia pages of their own. Howard Rosenblum doesn’t even have a wikipedia page of his own. What the hell is up with that? His achievements absolutely warrant one. I don’t have a Wikipedia account, let alone a history of edits to give me credibility there. But does anyone here? This really needs to be fixed. Like, right now.

Back to the point. Here’s a summary of the four most prominent candidates.

##Daniel Biss

Daniel Biss is a former assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago who became a career politician in the area. He served in the Illinois House and Senate from 2011 to 2019. In 2018, he ran for Illinois governor and came in second.

Biss was then elected mayor of Evanston in 2021. Evanston is a Chicago suburb located within Illinois’ ninth district. He has held that position since.

His achievements include policies focused on affordable housing, social justice reforms, and environmental leadership.

Biss is one of the front-runners for the ninth district congressional seat, mainly because of his experience in government and his reputation as the most traditional politician among the four candidates.

##Laura Fine

Laura Fine worked in television as a producer, writer, reporter, and anchor after graduating college in the 1980s. I’m guessing she spent much of her early career in broadcasting. She also taught American Government and Constitution courses at Northeastern Illinois University, where she earned a master’s degree.

Fine was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 2013 and served there until 2019. She then moved up to the Illinois Senate representing the 9th district and has served there since.

She has been a member of several Senate committees, including behavioral and mental health, insurance, environment and conservation, health and human services, judiciary, public health, and worker’s compensation.

One interesting note is that Fine’s political career has closely trailed Daniel Biss’s path. She ran for the House seat when Biss moved to the Senate. Later, she ran for the Senate seat when Biss became mayor of Evanston.

Now, Fine is running head-to-head against Daniel Biss for the congressional seat.

Another point to mention is that Fine currently holds more endorsements from state legislators and officials than any other candidate in the race. Although I’m not local to the area, this makes her a formidable rival to Biss.

##Kat Abughazaleh

I want to start by saying she is professionally known as Kat Abu. I’ll refer to her as Kat Abu for the rest of the post instead of spelling out her full last name.

Out of the four candidates, Kat Abu has the most detailed Wikipedia entry. If you want to get to know her fully, check out her page. I’ll keep this summary brief because she is a complex and multi-layered individual, and I can’t do her justice by trying to condense everything here.

In short, Kat Abu is a journalist and social media influencer.

Her partner is currently the CEO of the company that owns The Onion.

I mean, that’s basically the best newspaper in the world, right? (wink, wink)

Kat Abu is a senior video producer for Media Matters for America, a non-profit, left-leaning watchdog journalism organization. Her job is to monitor content from Fox News. Her Twitter bio says, “I watch Tucker Carlson so you don’t have to.”

She moved to Chicago when her partner took the CEO position.

Kat Abu is running for Congress inspired by the spirit that made Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez an icon among young progressive politicians, and in line with Bernie Sanders encouraging young Americans to get involved.

More importantly, Kat Abu is Palestinian herself. I’ll say more about this later.

##Bushra Amiwala

Bushra Amiwala is Pakistani and from Chicago.

She ran for the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2018 but lost. Later, she ran for and was elected to the D73.5 Board of Education.

I don’t have a lot of time to research this in depth, and I couldn’t find exactly what her role is with the D73.5 Board of Education. I assume it is a significant leadership position within that system.

Amiwala is the first Gen Z elected official in the United States. By my calculation, she was elected to the D73.5 Board of Education at age 22. She is also reportedly the youngest Muslim elected official in the country.

It’s hard for me to fully interpret this information because her Wikipedia page seems to have been written very recently. I’m struggling to get a clear read on who she is. If anyone wants to do a deep dive on Bushra Amiwala and help me learn more, please feel free.

One more thing - Amiwala has been featured in three documentaries about promising young politicians produced by PBS, Amazon, and Hulu.

#The Israel vs. Middle East Element

Before I go any further with the discussion about Howard’s campaign, I feel I need to address this next point. It’s important, so I’m just going to lay it out here and then circle back to Howard afterward.

The geopolitical conflict between Israel and much of the Middle East is one of the oldest and most complicated in modern history. Over the past two years, it has become one of the central issues on the global political stage.

(Author’s note: To be clear, I’m not writing this section to express my own view on the conflict. It’s too complex for me, as an average Redditor, to fully explain, and that’s not the goal of this post. I’m writing for the r/deaf community, and I’m only including this topic because it has direct relevance to the race I’m covering.)

So how does this relate to the current congressional race?

Daniel Biss and Laura Fine, two of the leading candidates, are Jewish.

Biss comes from a Jewish family with a strong background in music. 

Fine, based on what I could find, is Jewish and has a public record as a pro-Israel politician.

On the other side, Kat Abu and Bushra Amiwala are both Middle Eastern. Kat Abu is Palestinian, and Bushra Amiwala is Pakistani.

Kat Abu has shared pro-Palestinian views on her social media accounts.

Bushra Amiwala’s position is more complex. She is from Skokie, Illinois, a town adjacent to the Ninth District. Skokie has a long and significant Jewish history. In the 1960s, its population was about 60 percent Jewish, though today it’s closer to 30 percent. Skokie was also the focal point of two major Supreme Court cases in which a Nazi group argued for its First Amendment right to rally there. At the time, Skokie was home to a large number of Holocaust survivors, and the town also houses a Holocaust museum. In recent years, the area appears to have seen an increase in Middle Eastern residents, which may explain Amiwala’s rise in local politics.

To bring this point into focus, we can look at a recent political development that has caused a ripple effect across the country - Zohran Mamdani’s primary win in New York City.

Mamdani is currently on the ballot in the upcoming New York City mayoral election and is seen as a serious contender. His primary victory was a major upset. He was considered the underdog against two well-known figures, Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams, and yet he now seems to have a real path to victory.

What made his rise even more striking is his position on the Middle East conflict. Most establishment politicians tend to lean pro-Israel. Mamdani, on the other hand, has been openly critical of Israel and strongly supportive of the Palestinian cause. That makes his candidacy particularly notable, especially in a city like New York City, which is home to many financial and political elites who tend to support Israel.

Mamdani is seen as part of the next generation of progressive politicians like those inspired by figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. The AOC/Bernie duo actually has already endorsed him. He also seems to be the next young politician to represent a movement led by Millennials and Gen Z.

#My Prediction

Simply put -

I think the race for Illinois’s Ninth District will come down to Daniel Biss as the most favorable pick, with Kat Abu as the dark horse who could seriously shake up the election.

Although the Ninth District makes up the northern crescent of the Chicago area, this is still, in many ways, a congressional race for the greater Chicago region.

What we’re likely to see is a contest between two groups. On one side, you have the population that embodies traditional, left-leaning Chicago values. That’s the base Daniel Biss connects with. On the other side, there’s a growing voter base made up of people in their 20s to 40s who are pushing for a more progressive agenda. And that’s the lane Kat Abu is running in.

#Now Let’s Circle Back to Howard Rosenblum

Howard is running in a crowded race, and he’s up against candidates who have much higher public profiles.

To bluntly address a point I mentioned earlier, Howard Rosenblum is Jewish. As unfortunate as this is to say, I suspect the current tension around the Israel–Palestine issue may work against him because of that fact.

But here’s the thing -

As a deaf person, I see Howard Rosenblum’s career portfolio as extraordinary and fully worthy of a congressional seat. There’s nothing I would love more than to see someone like him representing us in Congress. Our community may be small, but we deserve representation. Not just for the Deaf community, but for the broader disability community as well. I would love to see Howard take that seat.

Unfortunately, I just don’t see Howard’s portfolio as strong enough to rise above what voters in the area might be prioritizing in this particular race. The competition is steep.

I also can’t help but wonder if his recent resignation from NAD played a major role in his decision to run for Congress.

Howard stepped down from his CEO position at NAD in the aftermath of the 2024 Super Bowl fiasco within the Deaf community.

I have a lot of opinions about that Super Bowl situation, and I’m very much on Howard’s side. From what I’ve gathered, it seems like the pressure for him to resign came mostly from former NAD President Jenny Buechner, who placed blame on Howard when it wasn’t really his fault.

Still, the Super Bowl 2024 controversy led to his resignation, and that event became the catalyst for him launching a new organization under his name called “Deaf Equality.”

So now I wonder, does Howard know he doesn’t have a real shot at winning this race? 

And is he running to raise his profile and build momentum for his new venture?

If that’s what he’s doing, I won’t judge him for it.

I just wish we lived in a world where someone like Howard Rosenblum could be in Congress.

While I think it’d be great to have deaf representation in Congress, I’m not sure he’d be able to win even if he has all the intangibles. Right now I’m seeing a lot of social media interest and media interest in Kat Abughazaleh (https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKj9D5jRQC_/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==), not to mention 9 other candidates including Howard.

If only he could run in a different district!

Thanks for the write up, I learned quite a bit.

You got me excited, and I don’t live anywhere close to the district. I appreciate his advocacy for CC.

Doesn't he have some controversy as well with how he left NAD?

Thank you for taking the time to write this. I’ll be keeping an eye on this race now.

“The geopolitical conflict between Israel and much of the Middle East is one of the oldest and most complicated in modern history.”

Hard disagree with that toothless characterization. It’s not a conflict. It’s a genocide of a stateless and military-less people and it’s been happening since the ethnic cleansing known as the nakba.

Did you just identify Jewish leaders because you’re implying they’re Zionists? That is antisemitic to the highest degree. Why is nobody else’s religion noted?? You NEED to be aware that Jewish does not equal “Zionist.” I am proof of that. This is highly offensive.

As much as I would like to see representation like him, it’s very, very unlikely for him, or any other deaf person to succeed, in the current political climate.

Just FYI Kat is a joke candidate who's financial support is overwhelming from out of state and most of the in state donations are not from people who live in the district.


We don't  even know if she's going to get enough signatures to run in the dem primary. She needs signatures even to be accepted as a write-in candidate here.

I appreciate the depth of your post really well thought through. I want to offer a slightly different angle on a couple of points, especially around how the Jewish vote and Howard’s campaign strategy might play out.

On the Israel/Palestine question: I’m not sure I agree that Howard’s being Jewish will necessarily work against him. Chicago (and much of Illinois) is home to a strong Jewish community, with deep roots going back to migrations after WWII. That community still carries weight in the 9th District. Between Howard, Daniel Biss, and Laura Fine, I don’t think being Jewish is a liability, if anything, it’s table stakes in appealing to a significant portion of the electorate. At the end of the day, Jewish voters in the district will likely rally behind whichever candidate they feel best represents them on broader local issues. If Howard doesn’t lean into this and make the case for why he’s that candidate, he risks losing the votes he absolutely needs to be competitive.

The second piece I find puzzling is Howard’s campaign travel strategy. He’s been spending weekends in Rochester, D.C., and Deaf hubs across the country. My sense is that this is motivated by fundraising but the cost is valuable time away from the actual district. He doesn’t need Deaf votes; that base is already firmly behind him. As a politician, though, the real challenge is reaching the undecideds and those unlikely to vote for you unless they see you, hear you, and connect with you in person. If he doesn’t spend that time on the ground in Chicago suburbs, he’s essentially throwing away the weekends that could make or break a competitive race.

All of that said: I’m still 110% team Howard. He’s probably the most qualified Deaf leader we’ve ever seen step into this arena. But elections aren’t just about qualifications they’re about building coalitions, maximizing visibility with swing groups, and convincing people outside your natural base. Unless Howard makes that pivot, I don’t see the path to a win… but I give him a lot of credit for trying. I’d love nothing more than to see him in Congress.

I met Howard a couple of months ago and had a nice chat. 

Interesting to see he’s running for Congress. The more Deaf people we have running for elected offices, the better! 

OP you can easily create your own Wikipedia account and create a Wikipedia page for Howard. I’m a relatively experienced Wikipedia editor and I strongly encourage you to just create an account and go for it. Make a page for him! And for other deaf topics too please! 

You won’t be able to create anything complex like tables or infoboxes, just because that kind of thing takes time to learn, so keep the page simple to start with. ChatGPT might be able to help, I’ve never tried it that way. 

You are correct Howard seems unlikely to win, but don’t let that stop you creating a page for him! Just make sure that any fact about him is supported by a reference to a newspaper or other media. 

About his chances, first let me say I’m not American so I don’t fully understand the electoral system there. From what you say, it looks like Howard has official Democratic Party permission to stand as a candidate for that role. I have a feeling that this is intended by the Democratic Party as a ‘trial run’ for Howard. They want to see how much work he puts in, is he a fighter? can he connect with the local voters? Can he bring or build a team supporting him with the admin and promotion? Does he have fans? will he put in the legwork fundraising and knocking on doors? can he get a respectable share of the vote despite the odds? 
 
Most politicians do not win their first time. It can take 2, 3, or more election attempts to win. It’s an (expensive) learning process. If Howard does well then he may get offered a slot in a slightly more winnable area. Maybe with slightly more party support. Or maybe not.

Good luck to Howard and to any other Deaf person standing for election to a state or national role!

Howard has zero chance in this race, unfortunately. I’d love to see deaf leadership but usually politicians who already have track records often have a whole leg up due to their networks + access to campaign funding and such. 

If I were Howard, I’d run for a more local race, but perhaps this is one way to get free publicity for an easier ramp to other local races (like state or county roles)",2025-07-08 09:16:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lujyvp/howard_rosenblum_former_nad_ceo_is_running_for/
1lugu2b,deaf,Tips for me (hearing) becoming friends with another mom (deaf),"My husband and I frequent a park with our toddler and we see another couple with their son around the same age quite often. I knew at least one of the parents was deaf or hard of hearing because they sign with each other. Usually it’s the mom by herself at the park and I’ve tried waving hello but she avoids making eye contact. I’ve been teaching myself ASL slowly over the years. Besides letters and numbers, I know about 30 signs. I’ve been trying to use them with my son and he has learned 5 signs so far.

Yesterday, my son was signing “more” and “all done” at the park to me and the dad asked me in ASL of my son was deaf. I said no but that I was trying to learn ASL but only know a little. They were delighted! And the mom became conversational with me which I am so happy about because I see her and her little guy all the time.

Both parents are deaf and the son is hearing. How do I go about developing a friendship with them? I assume the same way as making friends with anyone else but I also don’t want to go into this totally ignorant about the deaf culture, and I also don’t want to come across as annoying. 

They seem really nice. We saw them again today and they greeted us and asked how we are doing. I am going to continue learning more ASL regardless, but I’ll probably pick up the pace now that we have new potential parent friends / park pals.

Besides that, any tips?

For you… keep doing asl! And keep persevering with the friendship. You’ll see the kids friendship blossom and yours too! Don’t be afraid of the friendship conversation being direct and blunt! Deaf people normally does not have a filter.

It won awards but didn't get a lot of press because it was an indie film.  Russell Harvard is fantastic as Matt. Check out other stuff Russell Harvard has been in as well...

This is pretty deaf

Very deaf. Not even remotely hoh lol 

Audiologist signed off in the severe category at the bottom. 

Your left ear can pick up on 95 while right ear was NR (not recorded, probably needs louder noise than the left). 

Congrats, you passed the Deaf test! 

You’ve adapted pretty well. I’m sure it wasn’t easy though!

legally, you’re deaf but label-wise, it’s up to you man

My hearing loss is severe/profound (heavy on the profound side) and your audiogram is the same or worse than mine.  I use the term deaf (small d) just because it emphasizes the severity of my hearing loss.  Hard of hearing is a much larger spectrum ranging from having slight difficulty without hearing aids to passing as fully hearing with aids, which I can do, but using “hard of hearing” means I have to explain which end of the spectrum I’m on where deaf is easier haha.

You can be either - be sure to understand the difference between Deaf (deaf community), deaf (not part of ASL community), or HoH if you prefer! Depends on your identity :)

I identify as Deaf and my audiogram is [like this](https://imgur.com/a/EHLqExb). I just don’t have the low frequencies you have. I used to have them but genetic progressive hearing loss took them when I was a teen.

I just got mine done too. I can’t hear high pitch sounds (toddler). I cannot understand her for the life of me. When she cries and talks. I don’t understand because all I hear is crying. That’s muffling her voice. I am getting hearing aids. Mostly for my daughter. But I am teaching her ASL. Yes I am still learning. That way we can communicate to each other. That way I can understand her more when signing

Mine is 120db and am profoundly deaf.. if that helps haha

I had hearing issues since birth has my mom has hearing issues as well and so does my sister but I could never get a good answer from any audiologist as most just wants to get it over with, struggled all throughout school managed to learn how to lip read, which came in handy when I started to wrestle in high school. Never learned asl, I can speak but most think I have an accent.

I use Deaf to describe myself and my hearing loss is not as severe lol. The label/identity you use to describe yourself is your own personal decision. Broadly speaking, the signing Deaf community and the hearing world use those terms to mean different things. For example, the hearing world would definitely consider me HOH because I hear well enough with hearing aids to “pass” for hearing. Some ppl in the signing Deaf community would call my very HOH for clearly not growing up in the Deaf community and signing ASL like a “hearing person” (as in like a second language). I personally use both the terms Deaf and HOH to refer to myself and will choose which label depending on my mood and the conversation.

Congrats on being a human auditory black hole!   I used to joke with my brother whenever we went to Sam's Club , I should take the free hearing test and tell them I attempted to hold back a violent sneeze while in the parking lot to see what their reaction would be.

Yes - absolutely, mine are similar.

Wow other people post their audiograms besides me! You are without hearing. Lacking hearing. Will you share the cause? Do you sign?

My audiogram is almost the same, the only difference is that I am able to hear more bass. And I am pretty deaf, can't hear what people say (with no hearing aids), unless they are VERY close to me.🥴

Whichever you prefer, the terms aren't strictly defined. But if you want guidance, I'd decide based on how you do functionally (which often doesn't correspond exactly to your audiogram) - if you use aids or implants and can do fairly well in the hearing world with them HoH is probably more accurate, if not deaf is better. These aren't strict definitions either, but in my experience people tend to assume HoH means you can function similar to a hearing person but with some difficulty or minimal adaptations whereas deaf means you rely on assistive tech or another person to do most things - eg an HoH person would usually be expected to speak pretty well &amp; understand a conversation, make standard phone calls etc, whereas a deaf person would use captioning for most conversations, use a textphone or have someone help them with calls etc. Be very careful about the term you choose and the assumptions people make because of it - I prefer to describe myself as deaf but I always say I'm HoH at work because I will simply not be allowed to do a lot of stuff if people think I won't be able to manage it safely or will need a lot of adjustments for it

Deaf with a little of hearing. How do you hear? More high pitched frequency or low pitched?

I do hear some sounds but no idea what they are but they are pretty loud

Your audiogram is worse than mine and I sometimes use the label deaf. I do have some hearing, but most hearing people have no concept as to the nuances.

Use whatever label you are comfortable with.

I identify as Deaf with less loss than you, I agree with everyone that it’s very personal. You have more than every right to call yourself deaf or Deaf based on what you’ve shared. But if HOH feels right for you or better resembles your daily experience, lead with that. I’ve learned it’s about accessibility and what feels right for me, not the technicality of what beeps I hear in a booth a few times a year 🤟🏼 much love!

Deaf. Looks like mine

Deaf.

Have they investigated a conductive loss? You have a fairly sizable air/bone gap

1lub6oa,deaf,Help me stop being blamed for my husband's hearing issues,"My husband has been ""hard of hearing"" for years, now.  I've done all I can do to help him, including making it possible for him to have hearing aids.

He decided to not, usually, wear the hearing aids.  Too inconvenient for him.  But now I get his anger directed at me when he cannot hear me.  He blasts the TV and then complains that I'm not speaking loud enough and, when I raise my voice, he says I'm ""yelling.""

He has posted on the wall the ""rules"" I'm supposed to follow in order to facilitate communications with someone with hearing loss - it's the usual things, like:  
\- Be in the same room  
\- Face the person  
\- Speak clearly   
\- Get their attention first, etc.

I try to be good about these things.  But, when I'm speaking to him, he will sometimes turn away FROM ME.  Or he will start a conversation from the other room, then get mad when he can't hear my part.  He doesn't seem to think there are any ""rules"" for HIM in improving our communication.  

Can anyone suggest a link that might give me the rules that the hearing-impaired party should follow, when trying to communicate effectively?  I want to hang it on the wall next to the rules he posted for me.

This isn’t a deaf issue. It’s a your husband is being an asshole issue. Written rules on the wall? He’s treating you like a child.

The problem is that your husband is an asshole and you deserve better. His behavior toward you is abusive bullshit.

Check out loveisrespect.org, let him know his behavior is not acceptable and encourage him to seek support. He can even text 988 and someone will get him appropriate resources. Not your fault and you deserve to be treated with respect, because your wellbeing matters! You're not alone, hearing loss affects lots of families and it's just something everyone needs to adapt to. Even if he chooses not to wear devices, he can do better.

As someone who wears hearing aids all her life since childhood, it always amuses me how older people (I am assuming he's losing hearing due to age here) refuses to accept that they're getting older and that it's ok to wear assistive devices, be it HA, glasses, or otherwise.

*Anyways*, your husband comes across as someone is halfway accepting his reality - that he needs people to accommodate him, but he won't accommodate himself. 

It's his choice to not wear hearing aids. It's his choice to not use subtitles (hence why the tv is blasting). It's his choice to not uphold the same rules on his end. However, he can't be hearing and hard of hearing at the same time - and every time he tries to, he will always be reminded that he's HoH. He's mad at himself, even though it's not his fault that's he's HoH (assuming that it's due to age or even genetics), and he's hurting you in the process.

I suggest talking to him, and have him understand your side. Decide as a couple if he needs some form of therapy to help him accept his disability and any underlying anger. If he can't do that, then you'll have to make tough choices about your relationship - because right now, he is very rude to you without reason and it's not fair to you.

As a side note, hearing aids are always tough when you put on a new pair, the sounds are weird at first, and maybe even too loud. People who are new to HAs tends to ignore the fact that they can book a follow up appointment to readjust their HA programming. But like with glasses, your brain will adapt if you choose to keep them on. :)

I'm married to a deaf man who I like to joke believes ""hearing is magic"" as in: he will speak to me in a completely normal volume while I'm washing dishes, using the ice maker, wearing headphones, or in a completely different room. He genuinely has no idea what a ""normal"" level of hearing sensitivity is. He also sometimes (early morning before work and late night before bed) just... Doesn't wear his hearing aids and not tell me he's taking them out. He will miss things I say because he can't see me speaking, wander off in the middle of conversations, and leave the fridge door ajar (it beeps).

But ya know what he *doesn't* do? Act like a complete douchenozzle about it.

Your husband isn't acting like this because he has hearing loss, he's acting this way because he's an asshole.

He clearly is having difficulties accepting his HL. As long as YOU adjust to his needs, he does not have to face the reality of losing his hearing, the problem is YOU. Of course, you are not the problem. For strategies you listed to work, it has to be a two way process. I could be in someone's face but if they won't look at me so they can lipread, then it is likely they won't understand what I am saying. Perhaps that should be your sole rule, communication IS a two way process, hearing loss or not!

I agree with everyone. Here is a link to the Hearing Loss Assoc of America with communication guidelines for BOTH sides of the conversation. 
https://www.hearingloss.org/understanding-hearing-loss/hearing-loss-101/communication-tips/
Consider printing this on the list of tips:
Communication is a 2-way street. 
You’re wasting money if you do t wear your aids AND visit your audiologist for adjustments. Those visits are included in the price! 
Since he’s so stubborn, here are dangerous consequences to not working with your audiologist to ensure your aids fit properly and work as well as they can AND to not wearing them all the time:
30% increase in risk of falling (NOT due to balance issues)
Not discovering that constant use is needed to get used to them as quickly as possible AND feeding your brain accurate information.  It’s a better world when you wear them and know what’s going on. 
It’s frustrating, stress-inducing, and maddening for everyone involved, and those emotions contribute to multiple unpleasant body ailments. 
You lose credibility and people stop talking to you. 
You annoy others who stop coming to visit and invite you out. You lose friends. 
You isolate and become anxious and depressed. 
All these feelings contribute to dementia and Alzheimer’s. 
You’re more likely to require assisted living, which is VERY expensive. 
There are more. Hearing loss.org is the place to go. It’s all free. Good luck.

I ask my husband to do the same things as that list but then I forget and do things like start talking to him from another room (I used to be hearing) but this is my fault not his! Your husband is being unreasonable here.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

I agree with what everyone else is saying here about how this is an asshole thing, lack of respect thing, rather than a hearing thing. However, I wonder if some talking therapy might help him come to terms with his hearing. Perhaps he’s struggling to accept it, having decided not to wear his aids most of the time and behaving the way a hearing person behaves (eg. Turning away from you, starting a conversation from a different room.) I wonder if there is some self-hatred in there that is being misdirected at you, because there’s no one to blame for being deaf. I hope things get better xxx

Sometimes I will ask my husband a question while I’m in another room (I know I shouldn’t do this, cause I most likely won’t hear him… I’m HoH, myself. My husband won’t answer until I’m back in the room he’s in and within conversational distance to answer. Heh, it’s always a gentle reminder for me to wait until I’m in a better situation to communicate.

Edit to add: myself and my husband are not jerks though. Sometimes there’s frustration with communication. But we both are mindful of what works for us. I’ve been HoH/Deaf my whole life and he’s incredibly respectful of me and my needs. I’m sorry your husband is not.

Here’s how I would post if I were to be petty. First of all, even if one doesn’t want to learn how to sign conversationally, there are other sign-tools. 

The fingerspellling bridge system, otherwise known as the Rochester method allows for continued English grammar by simply visualizing English sentences by fingerspelling. Pauses between words, punctuation markers as necessary, etc. 

You could tell him he has two options: 
-wear the damn hearing aids if he doesn’t want to follow his own rules
-or learn to fingerspell (post the fingerspelling alphabet next to that option).

For what it’s worth…my husband (also Hoh) tries to start conversations with me through walls. When he tells my name, I reply “huh?”  I just don’t engage. I keep saying “huh?” til he comes to find me and talk to my face. When he asks me why I didn’t respond, I tell him I couldn’t hear him. It goes both ways. I can’t talk to you through walls, you can’t talk to me through walls.

Mine is starting to do this. He can’t hear and as soon as I get frustrated and have to repeat myself three times, he yells at me to not even talk to him. I’m getting so sick and tired of him making me the problem.

Here is a good link: https://gprivate.com/63ue6

You must visit a Deaf sign language class to see if you like it. Meeting other Deaf people is the number one way to mentally heal yourself and your partner from hearing loss. Sign language classes with my hearing husband became my refuge and a place to make new friends. We also stopped fighting all the time.

1lu6dco,deaf,Considering a move to Tennessee or a job at TSD Knoxville?,"I feel compelled to speak up about something that’s been weighing on me. If you’re considering moving to Tennessee — especially to work at Tennessee School for Deaf TSD in Knoxville — please think twice. While the state may be beautiful, my experience there was far from it.

The environment at TSD felt toxic. Many people were not genuine, and I saw situations where others were used, manipulated, or even targeted. There’s a lot of dysfunction and it’s hard to trust anyone. It’s a place where cheaters and liars seem to thrive, and that wears on your mental and emotional well-being.

Personally, I found myself spiraling — either feeling mentally unwell or using food as a way to cope, which led to unhealthy weight gain. And I know I’m not alone. I’ve seen several Deaf people leave shortly after moving there, and that really says something.

The school itself is very hearing-centric. Deaf professionals often struggle to find support or advocacy among their peers because many have become conditioned to let hearing people take the lead. That dynamic is disheartening. Hearing staff often seem to pity Deaf folks or underestimate us, and the impact on the students is clear. Many are far behind, and there’s a serious lack of strong Deaf role models — not because they don’t exist, but because the system doesn’t make space for them to lead or thrive.

This post isn’t to spread hate, but to shed light on an environment that many Deaf professionals find harmful or unsustainable. If you’re considering a move, I’d encourage you to connect with people who have lived or worked there before making a decision.

I'm sorry to hear this about TSD.  Getting a heads' up from other Deafies is appreciated, though each person's experience might be different depending on the supervisor, department, etc.  It's important to scout a potential employer to get a feel for whether it could be a toxic environment.  Unfortunately you don't always know if it will be toxic until you accept the job and find out.  I taught at FSDB and it was an okay experience. I went to Gally and saw a lot of brown-nosing for jobs, gatekeeping, and clique mentality, but most people know about that.  Teaching in a hearing school was the WORST- that environment is, IMO, toxic by default.

One of my friends took a job there but left after five months due to toxic environment just like you described.

[removed]

I’m from TN and was astonished that the graduating class a few years ago was considered a success with most students enrolling in the “transition to adulthood class” that lets them live at TSD until they are 21. 
The valedictorian went to a community college. Nothing against CCs but Deaf students can and do attend real colleges.

Deaf education needs to be held to a much higher standard. It made me glad that I was mainstreamed and then attended a good school on scholarship. I wished I had more connection with the Deaf community but I’d never be approaching graduation from medical school if I had gone to TSD.

Yes, I agree I worked there for less a year and left Teachers are not bad It's just the principals, school counselors and admin that are lousy and don't know ASL before working there!!!!!!  They think they are more qualified than the deaf workers who is culturally deaf and use ASL as their primary mode of communication, like come on!!!!!

YES, honestly. I completely agree with you. If you want to lose your soul and have your light dimmed, that’s the place to go. I’ve worked in few different deaf schools over the years, and Tennessee was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had. It was deeply toxic - I was treated like I was incompetent despite being highly qualified, and the environment was incredibly isolating. The racism, the audism, the bullying- it was all there, and it nearly broke me. I’m so glad I got out when I did. No one deserves to be in a place like that, especially not children. That school should absolutely be held accountable and shut down. It’s not safe or ethical.

1lu07wc,deaf,Lip-reading in group/multi-person conversations?,"How possible/viable is that? From my hearing/non-lip-reading perspective, it seems like it'd be a giant pain in the ass. And if it is as much of a pain as it seems like it'd be, is there any real way to participate in big, multi-person conversations with all or mostly non-signing people?

[댓글]
&gt; it seems like it'd be a giant pain in the ass.

That's right. 

&gt;  is there any real way to participate in big, multi-person conversations with all or mostly non-signing people?

No, not really but often we're not given much of any other option than to try.

Yeah, if I have to take part in a group setting with hearing people, I'm gonna be ""nope"". Lip reading is so tiring and you can only understand about 30% of what's been said, the rest you have to guess by context. So unless there is an interpreter, I can't take part in a group convo.

To be honest, I'd rather have one on one conversations. It's just easier for me that way to focus on a single person.

There is, if people take turns speaking one at a time to allow for participation. 

You have it easy. You automatically filter background noises out (trucks/cars going by, honking, birds, silverware clanking, “What’ll you have?” “I’ll have the cod with the lemon butter sauce and…”, “Edgar, you get back here RIGHT NOW!”, music and announcements from overhead speakers, ringing phones, yelling, laughter, various levels of loudness re: people speaking to each other, people in your group having side conversations, rattling carriages and beeping from registers, people who have growly voices or who are quiet or too deep or too high to understand or who have beards and mustaches that may not be well kept, people hiding their mouths behind napkins or hands… and you can magically hear and respond to whoever you’re listening to. 

In contrast, we have to work HARD to filter these out, and we still get things wrong. Case in point: a friend and I went through a car wash earlier today. During the blowdry part, she was telling me there’s some sort of graphic that lights up as a nice surprise for customers at the end: Santa in his sleigh, Dolly Parton… and something else that I couldn’t hear over the multiple fans and blowing air. So she told me she’d tell me once we were out of there. I said, “What about Dolly Parton?” She laughed. “I didn’t say anything about Dolly Parton. I said Mario. From Nintendo? They have Santa and Mario graphics at the end sometimes.”

Quiet spaces are easier to carry a conversation. It’s less brain work, therefore less tiring. The more we have to work to focus and figure out what someone says, the more exhausted we are at the end of the day. It’s like Tetris: Their lips made this shape so what word fits this and also makes sense in context? Sometimes having to bluff understanding after asking them to repeat five times without any clarity whatsoever so nod and move on and ask someone later.

Big nope.part of it so big fatigue and big DGAF attitude I have; I have very *little* patience for hearing folks not willing to do more work to meet me half way. Many don’t do bare minimum, so I don’t invite them in my life then.  

I stick with folks who are deaf, can sign or/and willing to put in the work themselves. I’m much happier for it. 

I have a thriving career, kids, my several different 2-3 group of friends, and i travel good bit. I don’t need hearing ableist folks who simply don’t get it or care to understand more about my world as a Deaf person. They often need *me* more than I need them.

If I'm gonna do that, I might as well dress up as a tree,, at least I can provide some shade.

There's no connection if I have to do all the lipreading.

I’m not a fan, i can do it but it definitely took me a lot of time to get any good at it

The way I like to explain how conversations are like with a cochlear implant is, if imagine numbers 1 - 10.  I might  hear 1,2,3,5,8,10 and have enough context to fill in the blanks.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.  Multiply that times X number of people in the room.  If there's like more than 5 people in a group and I don't really know who they are, I tend to check out and not pay attention.   I have a far better chance of hearing numbers 1 -10 for each individual person because I hear it. 

All that to say, let's look at lip reading - something I am good at as a profoundly deaf person.   A person who speaks clearly may not have lips that read clearly.  It's far harder to read numbers 1 -10 because there's a surprisingly wide range of lip postures that make me wonder how they can even speak.  The moment someone has a lip posture that isn't conducive to lip reading, all context is lost for me and it derails everything.  All it takes is 1 person, and the chances of there being 1 or more people with lips that are challenging/not possible to read is basically guaranteed in a group setting.

It’s possible, but quickly exhausting and I have residual hearing amplified with aids. I think the vast majority of us give up on understanding more than like 4 people in the group. Those that know me well also know that I will tune in and out of a conversation simply because I can’t keep up in settings like that without wanting to bounce after 30 minutes from fatigue. I think we do a lot of “soaking up the ambiance” when others are actually socializing.

Twos company, there's a crowd.

In a one-to-one conversation, you know what half of the conversation is. Introduce a third person and potentially it's not a 3rd of the conversation you /still understand: it's nothing as the other two people talk to each other more and you fall out of the conversation.

Standing around in a group you can very easily find yourself falling out of the conversation and actually out of the group entirely as active participants turn to each other and move in front of you. Literally an outsider.

You might be thinking of [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) but it's only the premium tier that lets you add vocabulary.  What you probably really need/want is a live human captioner that can handle all the uncommon words and jargon you'd get in a classroom setting.  You're paying way too much in tuition (probably) the get anything less than equal access. 

If they balk at the costs of CART (communication access real-time translation aka a live captioner) you can try to remind them of Exodus 4:11.  Since this is seminary it's probably a private institution that's not obligated to follow equal access laws.  Good luck!

And while they're in an accommodating mood, see if you can get the profs to wear a clip-on Bluetooth mic during class. (You would bring it between classes and manage supply/retreival.) Much better, more recognition-friendly audio signal.

1ltx1g6,deaf,Baby cry transmitter - Australia,"I'll start this post with an apology, none of the people involve in my question are deaf nor have any reduction in their hearing abilities. Hear me out. Oh and I have searched this sub and read the wikipage. 

I'm a parent to twin toddlers. Some of the medication I take at night sedates me, so I am basically knocked out. My wife is who primarily tends to our babies. We've had an impossible time with their sleep, so it's not uncommon for my wife to get 2-3 hrs of sleep at night.

The babies currently are each in their own room. Both their rooms share a wall with ours - we're not fat at all. We have 2 different monitor systems, which should be enough. But the stars have aligned a few times, both have failed, and we've woken to the horrific realisation that our babies have been crying, and we did not hear them. No shade to people who sleep train; it's simply not in line with our values. 

Last year, when they were newborns and I was working and up doing feeds too, we found in our exhaustion, we kept turning off alarms on our phones, but had no recollection of this. I can't remember how I came across is, but I ended up buying an old Bellman &amp; Symfon clock and bed shaker and it was a blessing. No more missed alarms. Now that the babies are in their own room (I say babies, they're both &gt;12mo old), we need something that alerts us **reliably** that they need us. 

I'm aware B&amp;S have a baby cry transmitter + receiver system. The 2 x baby cry transmitters + the flash receiver would cost us AUD $962 which is crazy expensive. The wiki page listed other makers like Clarity, bebcare, Sonic Alert, and Serene innovations. Most of these are not available here. 

I'm hoping fellow Aussies can comment on what they use? maybe the B&amp;S is worth the steep price, or maybe there are alternatives we've not considered.

There may also be Deaf folks in the audience, so there will also be an ASL interpreter on stage, but we will need an English speaking DGS interpreter to bridge this gap. Or am I seeing this the wrong way? All help is welcome!

German here.

We actually have some Deaf interpreters (DGS natives) who can translate to ASL or International Sign and vice versa.

The best solution would be to hire one straight from Germany.

1lt9yz7,deaf,Has anyone else noticed this when turning deaf.,"For context i turned fully deaf recently and here are a few things ive noticed.

1. New inner voice, when talking i have a more desireble voice in my mind
2. Being able to turn into any voice, e.g micheal jackson when i sing
3. Giving people voices that may not be accurate like how id think they sound.

Would love to see if these are common experiences

I’m not fully deaf, just profoundly, but I have noticed that my voice sounds much more desirable to me when I’m talking/singing than when I record or when I hear myself talking to other people. And #2 actually has a name! It’s called Vocal Mimicry! It’s a rare talent where you can basically sound exactly like whoever is singing, and use the techniques they do perfectly, so close you could prank someone into thinking you were them! It’s really cool. I want to see if I can get any further with it. They say vocal mimicry is a great talent to have if your interested in voice acting :) not really sure what #3 means though

1. Nope 
2. What?


3. Yes. Especially when watching TV. My brain defaults to American accents also.",2025-07-06 19:37:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lt9yz7/has_anyone_else_noticed_this_when_turning_deaf/

1lt654f,deaf,Update on brother rejecting deaf culture and refusing deaf school,"So I posted here this week and lots of people gave me some advice which I used. 

So last night me, my deaf sister and young brother decided to have some hanging out time, mom wanted us to have a talk and see if we can solve it or relate to him. 

Anyway I hadn’t gotten much further than “so we need to talk about how you have been lately” and he started crying. Basically he thought he was in a lot of trouble and we had begun to hate him, ridiculous I know. Anyway I didn’t even get to say anything before he had apologized and said he will go to the deaf school. So basically I never had to do anything. 

Turns out someone at his elementary school which is deaf school (forgot to mention this in the other post) also recently got a CI and has been bragging privately to friends about going to mainstream school and not being deaf and how he is glad he isn’t deaf anymore and how bad it is to be deaf, all sorts of ridiculous stuff. Brother has been taking this and thinking that was how me and my sister felt.

Of course we told him this is stupid, not true and the boy is lying because it is not a cure. We explained in detail what a CI is and what it does and how it isn’t the same as “hearing”. I think this was important because since he was refused a CI he has been in the dark about what it is really because I think we didn’t want to talk about them with him because we wrongly thought that was the best idea.

Anyway he had a lot of cute questions about them and we played around with them testing and
trying to explain what it’s like because it’s hard as he is completely deaf so we were trying to explain and compare. I think this made him feel more included and welcome in this middle space where before it felt like he wasn’t welcomed or allowed to talk about it. 

Overall he is having a hard time being deaf, seeing so many around him getting a CI has made him feel left behind and others are moving on. It seems he struggled with the concept of a CI and how it is certainly not a cure. In the end he is happy for us and hopes that we can help him with hearing problems in the future and I said of course we will always be there 24/7 anytime he needs. 

Staff from the deaf school will be visiting to chat with him next week and he will go to an open day there but as of now he has agreed to go to that school. We are also arranging some play dates??? With a bunch of girls from his school who are also continuing onto the same deaf school. Apparently they big into my brother but he has been too emo to realize and make new friends. 

Anyway we ended the night watching Zootopia before he tragically passed away in my bed from too much Taco Bell where his lifeless body remains now 10 hours later…

&gt;!Also not related to this sub so feel free to ignore it but he took me by surprise by telling me he believes he is gay? He is 9 so like that can’t be possible right? I am not sure what to do with that? My mom won’t mind and will be happy either way but I also won’t betray him and tell her and my sister won’t either but that really took us by surprise. I just told him that’s fine and we love him whoever he is. I mean my sister is Lesbian and we have LGBT friends so it’s a safe space.!&lt;

Plenty of elementary school kids have crushes. If he’s got crushes on boys, it is totally normal for him to think he’s gay. That may or may not be true, things might change as he gets older, but plenty of nine year olds already think they are “straight”.

Sounds like you are very supportive! I'm just gonna touch in the last part. I would keep his secret until he is ready to tell others. It might just be friend crushes or he might be really gay. Best to continue to support him and see where he goes with it.

I’m so glad things worked out and he was able to talk about these things. It sounds like everything is going to be okay, if not better! 

Unfortunately there are people who view deafness negatively, and that rubs off on kids leading to some awful situations and perspectives. 

I wish I had someone to talk to as a kid about these people, as I didn’t realize how prominent a role they could play in my life and future.

Besides that! Yes, it’s totally possible for a 9 year old to know they’re gay or begin thinking about sexuality.

Kids start to understand who they are and who they like at different ages, and that’s a perfectly normal part of growing up. (There is plenty of research and resources that support this) 

The best thing you can do is support him. Let him know you believe him and that you’re proud he trusted you.

The most important thing you can do is show him love, support, and acceptance. 

Let him know that you believe him and that you’re proud of him for trusting you. That kind of affirmation can make a huge difference in how safe and confident he feels as he continues to grow.

You don’t need to push him to label anything or explain himself more than he wants to. 

Just make it clear you’re there for him no matter what. If he has questions or wants to talk more, you can be a safe space for those conversations. 

Encouraging age appropriate conversations about kindness, respect, and healthy relationships - regardless of gender - is helpful for all kids, not just LGBTQ+ ones.

If your family is open to it, reading inclusive books/media together or connecting with affirming resources can also help him feel seen and supported.

Your brother is very lucky to have you in his life

Ridiculous. Since when are we ashamed to be deaf? We had that #DeafPower stance. Sad how it's like that these days. 

If he doesn't want CI, it's fine! If he does, it's fine! He will always be deaf whether he likes it or not. It makes him who he is, and only him can change the perspective on himself.

I'm glad he confided in you on how he thinks he is gay. You are his safe space. Thank you for being supportive.

Incredible. Bless you and your family. Wish y’all the best :)

Thank you for being supportive of your brother. You are someone I wish I had when I was younger. Your sister as well. I would go at his pace. Just walk alongside him and do what you did when he falters. That's the best thing you can do.

Thank you for updating us, I'm so sorry to hear that your brother has been having a tough time but I'm really glad he has you to support him and that things are going a bit better.

Awesome update. Glad you were able to help him work it out. Nobody likes snobby elite type people anyway.

I got my CI activated a month ago, I’m bimodal (left with CI, right with hearingaid) how i described the difference recently to one of my deaf aunties (not bio but basically is family lol) is this: 

CI feels like black and white TV, for some people they dont like it, its difficult to tell differences with people (like men in similar looking suits), and you have to learn how to adjust to the difference (color vs b/w)
Hearing aids sound like color, which seems self explanatory.

CI can make hearing accessible, but it is in no way a “cure”. I got diagnosed with hearing loss at 6 months, my type is genetic, so a lot of my family members have it too. I remember at that age being ashamed because i was the only kid in my grade with hearing loss, and stepped away from deaf culture and sign for a while. He’s not the only one who feels like this :)

As for his crushes thing: it can be possible, kids that age see crushes as a crush, regardless of gender unless someone else points it out yk?

As far as the last part, it’s wholly possible that your brother might actually be right about how he feels— I knew I wasn’t straight by then—but he has plenty of time to figure all that out later. I think he needs to worry about having platonic friendships for now— I do think he’s too young to worry about dating at age 9.

The thing with the last part is that some folks inherently associate being LGBTQ with sex instead of sexuality. I grew up in a house with lesbian mum, gay cousins etc so it wasn't really that big a deal, to the point I waited years to come out because it wasn't a big deal. I figured it out when I was 12, first dated at 13 and came out at 16. 


At that age, I don't think it's an idea to push for an absolute answer. Kids often can misinterpret the way adults use words. And kids are still learning to understand their emotions. It might just be that he feels less social pressure around boys, less awkward, and so is interpreting that as romantic preference. 


He might be gay. He might be something else. At this point in life it's not really a priority to figure out anyway. It's a balancing act. 


On the one hand there's the need to say that, hey if that's the case, that's fine. Without also doubling down and essentially telling the kid yes that's definitely it. I've known guys who at one point said to parents they liked boys, parents told them they're gay then in their later teens and early adult years it's ""I'm bi but my parents won't listen""


At that age (9) I actually had a girlfriend. She was 8. She was my best mates sister. Every day I'd go to his parents house to play toys together. I'd poke my head around her bedroom door to say hi and wave and ask how she was. Then 3 minutes later was just me and my best mate playing toys outside. After a month we said it was a great marriage and so then got divorced and I got her a chocolate bar and we shook hands. Because we were 9 and that's how kids kinda see relationships. I don't even think holding hands crossed our mind let alone a kiss. That would been gross back then. 


Kids emulate adult behaviour a lot. On the one hand, ensure he's kept safe from online predation etc. Naïveté etc. But on the other hand a lot of things are more innocent than adults like to believe. 


One of my siste4s thought she was bi as a teen and now she has a wife. Another sister thought she was bi but nah turns out hetero. It doesn't matter whether they are or aren't queer, but it's great when ppl feel comfortable to explore the potential possibility

1lt4chv,deaf,I'm losing my hearing - struggling to navigate parenting.,"When I turned 40 I noticed I couldn't hear out of my right ear much. In retrospect it's weird this didn't alarm me, but it was another year before I mentioned it to my doctor and two years til I got hearing aids for moderate loss. Another two years went by and I now have severe loss, ENT believes it's genetic, and a decision about whether to proceed with CIs is in my near future.

I have five children ranging from 4-11. Aside from obvious questions about whether they got the genes that will land them in the same boat eventually...I'm struggling with how to parent as I'm going deaf. We are learning ASL, and that's a mixed bag - sometimes we are excited about it and sometimes learning a new language is just hard work, but we practice constantly because even my hearing aids don't let me hear normally - especially kid voices in a noisy environment. Often it feels like the world is going on around me and I have limited understanding of what's happening. I miss a lot. With my kids, that worries me. My 6 year old came up and starting telling me some deep feelings stuff and I honestly couldn't understand a lot of it. I just couldn't hear. I don't want to be a distant, disengaged parent.

Has anyone else faced this adjustment? I know there are ways to solve these problems. I've told the kids if I get CIs I won't hear at all without them, and if I don't get CIs, I still won't hear, so this issue is here to stay and we figure out how to adjust. I just feel like I'm doing it badly and I don't know anyone who has gone through it. I can't be the only one I'm sure...

i am profoundly deaf and wear a hearing aid, and i’m a mother to kids too. i don’t think getting a CI is going to be any different than wearing a hearing aid. if i were you, id try getting a better, stronger hearing aid before a CI.  i have a friend who “maxed” out her hearing aid and got a CI. it helped her hear again but she told me that she had to relearn hearing all over again because the sounds were completely different from wearing hearing aids. CIs produce artificial sounds , hearing aids amplify the sounds.  if you have explored all possible options before CI, and still need CI… then go for it. just be aware you might have to spend some time relearning the sounds.

I’m HoH but I think with less loss than you have, so I’m sure other people will have better tips. But for the deep feelings (and other) conversations, could you use a transcription app like Ava? It could be a little awkward because you’d need to have your phone on you, and you might have to say “Hold on, buddy, let me get my listening helper going [or whatever kid-understandable name you come up with for it].” But it might be a way to avoid that dread feeling of missing out on something important. I know that feeling and it’s no fun! There are also microphones that will stream to your hearing aids (if they have Bluetooth), which can be useful at the dinner table, for example. 

Good luck with all this, I’m sure it’s very stressful. But just remember that you’re still a great parent even if you can’t hear well. And plenty of Deaf people raise happy, healthy kids, and you will too. 💗

I say this with the utmost respect, welcome to the club. Whether you’re a parent or not, this is the reality many of us live with daily.

Before making any decisions about cochlear implants (CIs), make sure you understand the type of hearing loss you have. In some cases, surgery or other treatments might be an option to improve your hearing.

As for ASL, it definitely takes time to learn, but be patient with yourself; it’s absolutely worth it.

When it comes to communicating with your kids, try to be face-to-face, choose a quiet setting when possible, or ask them to wait until the right time for serious conversations. Visuals become everything, we rely on them heavily.

Start practicing lip reading, learning ASL, using captions, and preparing yourself for the moments when people won’t understand what you’re going through. Unfortunately, that will happen. But you’ll also find your voice and strength, there will be times you’ll need to stand your ground and advocate for yourself.

You’re not alone in this. You’ve got a whole community here that gets it.

You can do it, you already started down the ASL path, which is great.

Your kids will adapt, they are amazingly good at that. A lot of times the act of listening, even if you don't understand some/all of it is *enough*. You will get better over time. You probably can already tell their emotional state, which tells you a lot without needing to really know the particular specifics.

How is your significant other and the other adults in the lives of the children? Are they going down the ASL path as well? If so, amazing! Woohoo!

We had a game we would play on occasion: trying to lipread. It was mostly fun for everyone, and gave everyone a much better understanding of the limits of lipreading.  Yours might be a touch young for it, but it might be worth trying. We limited it to items on a table at first and then slowly grew what was allowed and what wasn't.

We also got flashcards of the different handshapes, and had a game trying to come up with words in ASL with the handshape on that flashcard. It helped add vocabulary and it was fun. Works pretty well for road trips.

The ones in my life are all over 18 now and spread out around the world. Some sign with me more than others, but we all communicate well enough.

As for CI's or not, no idea. I'm deaf and non-verbal, so fitting into the hearing world just isn't going to work no matter what.

You've got this, the important thing about parenting, to me, is being present. Keep showing up every day and you've got this nailed.

31 yo oral deaf mom here of a hearing toddler. I’m not in the mood fact same situation but sharing in case it’s any reassurance.

Backstory: I’ve had progressive deafness my entire life, with a CI on one ear since I was 2 and hearing aid on the other since infancy. My husband is an oral deaf CI user as well (two CIs since infancy). We’re completely oral with our daughter but sign to each other as needed (namely when our CIs have to come off, such as in pool, at the beach, etc). We’re teaching our daughter sign as well. 

My main point: The CI technology that exists today, is *incredible*.  In your shoes, I would 10000% do the CIs. 

I spent a decade being a CI candidate for my hearing aid side, but didn’t want to for emotional reasons (didn’t want to “give up my remaining natural hearing”, which of course- honestly- sounded significantly more pleasing and “fuller” then the artificial hearing on my CI side). But with the recent, accelerated progression of the loss of that remaining hearing, I’m now going to get the second CI. I’m still emotional about this but with what little my hearing aids do, I’m now missing out on more than it’s worth. I’ll now be 100% reliant on CIs, but it’ll ironically give me more options..

Have you thought about working with a Deaf therapist who can sign and speak? I’m sure a therapist can support you through your journey as a Deaf person. Check out [Deaf Counseling Center](https://www.deafcounseling.com) and ask them for resources.

I recommend both. Learn ASL as a family. And get the CI. The CI will allow you absolutely hear your kids again and function/communicate much better. Since your loss was gradual, your brain already remembers sounds and it won't be as huge an adjustment as it'd be for a Deaf from life person. But I say learning ASL too as backup...for nights when you don't wear it, if it fails, if it breaks, if you're in water. Just my 2 cents.

Wow, thank you, everyone. I feel much better about this situation. I so appreciate all the thoughts, ideas and kindness you've shared. I have a lot to think about and try!

When you say we practice constantly, do you mean ""we set aside time when we do activities to learn asl"" or ""asl is a normal part of our day to day life"" cause like, maybe this is just a moment on the internet thing, but ""practice"" is a really weird word to use for the main language you communicate in, so maybe that's what you need to switch? Like even just having set times of the day where the expectation is it will be voices off, even the kids with each other, and just building up to more and more time at they get comfortable. Kids are so adaptable and will absolutely work around gaps in their knowledge to communicate with each other.

Wow! It’s so hard I’ve been there! It’s really hard to lose hearing in a family as a parent. I had to accept my heating loss and get hearing aids to hear my kids. Kids don’t stop to face me so I can read their lips all the time. Hearing aids give me hearing so I’m not in the exact same boat. Just lots of good advice here!

Your not the only one. Im 45 and my hearing began to change about a year after my daughter was born (2016). Missed a lot of things even her first words werent clear to me . I use a roger mic now quite often with her makes it much easier to hear her but i still find deciphering words (gah i hate pokemon names) are hard. We went sort of some route and are learning ASL as well. If you need resources message me ill share what i have but i do wish that people would figure out its not just children who need help understanding all of this or that need support but often the parents do and we are sort of left out in the middle of nowhere because people think we magically adapt. I have seen soo many resources for deaf children or  CODA's  but nothing for late deafened parents.",2025-07-06 15:44:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lt4chv/im_losing_my_hearing_struggling_to_navigate/

1lsl6mp,deaf,Question about names,"I have a dumb question. Is it impolite for a hearing person to use a Deaf person's sign name to them (in a story, for example) without personally being given their sign name? Is it rude and is it more polite to fingerspell instead until you're specifically told you can use it? 
Here is the context. I know ASL and am somewhat involved with the local Deaf community and once or twice I've met someone who didn't give me their sign name directly but they themselves used it in a story to me about themselves (like quoting someone else) so I picked it up. Usually it doesn't matter because it's not like i usually need to use it in a conversation with that person. In this case I used their sign name in a story to the person and got a raised eyebrow. I asked the person if it was inappropriate to use their sign name and they told me sign names are personal and only for family to use. I got so embarrassed and obviously never did it again. This was probably 6 months into knowing this person and it's in a formal setting, not personal life. Ever since then I have been wondering if it's part of Deaf culture that hearing people should not use a Deaf person's sign name unless told they can (introduced with it directly). Maybe it's too intimate a way to address people like using someone's nickname rather than their full name. Could that be? I'm sorry I'm ignorant but I really want to better understand.

1ls1byp,deaf,TTY: The Spy Movie,"#The Movie.

I just saw [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywC__z5VgZM) for a new movie coming out in August called “Relay,” starring Riz Ahmed.

It’s an action thriller where a TTY machine and the relay service actually play a central role in the plot. From what I can tell, Riz Ahmed plays a broker who helps corrupt corporations and whistleblowers exchange bribes and secrets.

The trailer explains that he uses a TTY machine and telecommunication relay service to carry out his shady dealings, taking advantage of FCC regulations under the ADA. Relay service operators are not allowed to disclose the content of any conversations they assist with, so the idea is that it’s a “safe” way to communicate illegally.

It’s honestly kind of hilarious. TTY is basically obsolete, though not entirely gone. They are nearly dead and they are on a metaphorical life-line because emergency services are federally required to support 711 calls. But in daily life, almost no one uses them anymore.

For many of us in the deaf community, TTY has a weird and often uncomfortable place in our memories. I remember having emotional conversations with my parents through a relay operator. I had to talk about things like our family dog dying and my grandma passing when I was at Gallaudet University, and some stranger was relaying all of that between us. It was awkward and deeply impersonal. Texting and FaceTime was truly a godsend for our community.

And now here comes this movie treating TTY like it’s some sleek, high-stakes espionage device.

To be fair, the movie looks pretty solid and I do plan on watching it. But every time I rewatch the trailer, I laugh at the dramatic shots of people using TTY machines like they’re pulling off some international spy operation.

#Does Riz Ahmed Have a Thing for the Deaf Community?

One thing that really caught my attention is that the lead in this movie is played by Riz Ahmed.

Back in 2021, he starred in Sound of Metal and earned an Oscar nomination for his performance. That film was absolutely phenomenal. It explored the identity crisis of a hearing person who suddenly loses his hearing, and it did so with incredible depth and sensitivity. The cast included a number of real deaf actors, and it featured one of the most realistic portrayals of hearing loss I’ve ever seen. The ending was pitch-perfect. I still think about that movie to this day.

And now, here he is playing the lead in a movie where TTY and relay services are central to the plot.

It definitely seems like a coincidence, but I can’t help wondering if his experience working on Sound of Metal influenced his decision to take on this role in Relay.

It doesn’t seem like much of a stretch to imagine that, during his deep dive into deaf culture and the experience of sudden hearing loss, Ahmed may have developed a real appreciation for the deaf community. Maybe when he read the Relay script and saw TTY mentioned, something clicked for him.

If that’s the case, I think that’s actually pretty cool.

RIZ AHMED - OUR HEARING ALLY! Our hearing champion!

I just wanted to spotlight the upcoming movie in this community.

I hope the poem resonates with some of y'all. It is infuriating how normalized ableist language can be among the ""standard"" humans. Society needs more empathy.

And I was indeed ""blind"" a year ago. My brain's and brainstem's axons were sheared apart following a 40 ft fall in the mountains (Grade 3 Diffuse Axonal Injury - Severe TBI).

And now, a powerful engine capable of self-healing (neuroplasticity) was seriously damaged *everywhere*. I saw the brain's self-healing capabilities, and so I channeled all my power, all my determination, into not falling victim to a second severe disability.

1lr4r0z,deaf,Is anyone else frustrated for those for heart of hearing when they put in high-frequency alert notification sounds in brand new apartment buildings?,"So I recently moved into a brand new apartment building, and this seems to be a pretty common misconception that higher or louder is better. That is not always true. Lower pitched, or lower frequency, and louder, or more intense, is better. That’s why they have 520 Hz alarm notification system.
However, there is a doorbell that says, audiovisual alert for the hearing-impaired, depress for five seconds. I was about to be placed there, when I chance to ask what it sounded like, and thank goodness I did, because with my hearing aids in, I can hear it, and it makes me feel really dizzy and nauseous, so I said, no way, no thank you. If I did not have my hearing aids, I would’ve not heard it, and also, I am visually impaired, so I would not have been able to see the strobe light at all.
I do have a central alert, page your notification system from Serena innovations, which vibrates, flashes, and have a low pitched tone alert. 
But what I don’t understand is why do contractors go through companies like Edwards, which does supply some accessible notification systems, but not always in the way that’s supposed to be perceived. For instance, our elevators, which I made by Schindler, their exterior chime tones are perfect, they fall within a low frequency range , though they’re not as loud.
Bedrooms are required to have a low tone, sounding fire alarm notification system to alert anyone that might be sleeping and or who might not have their hearing aids in. 
Why don’t they make things like that for doorbells or regular smoke and carbon monoxide detectors? ",2025-07-04 00:01:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lr4r0z/is_anyone_else_frustrated_for_those_for_heart_of/

Both my mom and I are hearing but I have a bit more knowledge of ASL than she does, so I know that the options for saying someone's name in sign is to either spell it out or give them a sign related to something they like to do that would be identifiable.

I noticed that they spell out Georgia's name most of the time (I think) but they have a sign for Ginny. I'd Google it but I'm not really sure how to Google what a specific sign means.

It's sort of an open hand and they press one finger (I think the ring finger?) to the cheek bone right under the eye. (Picture recreation attached)

If anyone knows what this is I'd love to hear it, and also if you need to correct me on anything don't be afraid to do so! I'm always trying to learn :)

georgia is signed like the state (GA) and i think ginnys has to do with freckles or dimples

Sign Names are not always identifiable Signs. You're a bit off base with the ""related to something they like to do."" It's much more variable than that. Sign names can be initialized (e.g. contain a letter hand shape from the person's name), they can be descriptive (e.g. a feature the person has - they wear glasses, have curly hair, use a cane, etc). A person can have multiple Sign Names depending on the communities they're involved with. A different Sign name with family vs friends vs coworkers.

Idk the show, but sign names are typically given based on traits a person has. (A friend of mine smiles a lot, so her sign name looks like a smile with the L handshape.)

Not about this sign in particular but [Handspeak has a searchable sign dictionary](https://www.handspeak.com/word/asl-eng/)

Are hearing people really out there asking y’all for sign names? Back in my day we were taught that it’s a nice thing if someone gives you one, but don’t go around begging for it.

My (HoH) Hearing ex tried to give me a sign name when he found out I didn’t have one 😳

Ironic since you literally did give me a sign name lmao

💀

Sadly yes this does happen ..have been asked 3-4 times for sign names .. only one got super persistent about it ... im hard of hearing and currently in ASL 6 (waiting for my grades) I have only given 2 people sign names one being my daughter (who has actually taken an ASL for kids class) and one for a friend who has been the most supportive person going. I haven't even given my wife one because I feel she hasn't earned it yet (long story)

Same with me. I never gave them their names - that is not how it works.

I would love a sign name. But it's something to be earned, not just randomly given. I may never get one, and if not, so be it.

You got earn your sign name...and it's only given by friends.

This is so embarrassing. How weird to ask for a sign name lol it’s like asking a Chinese friend for a Chinese name 😭 I think what a lot of hearing people fail to understand is that ASL is a LANGUAGE, not just an avenue for English to be expressed through signs.",2025-07-03 18:11:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lqwm09/all_hail_the_magic_conch/

It doesn't have to do with deafness. Some may be into it, some may not. We are all individuals with different opinions and interests.

Deaf men may not watch Andrew Tate (I have no idea whether his videos are captioned and do not care to find out) but the ideology behind Andrew Tate, the manosphere and its products, can absolutely reach vulnerable deaf men.

Why would deaf people be immune against toxic pop culture trends. They are deaf, not off-the-grid hermits lol

Yes. Look at any political related post by the Daily Moth and you’ll see MAGA bullshit unfortunately

Before social medias: yes higher degree of separation but today oh no.
But I think it is a matter of individuals. Some deaf people are really strict with only seeking out signed content and by then there’s some filter and lag.

But Deaf aren’t a monolith some do traverse everywhere, in particular those comfortable in reading and writing.

Language evolves over time. 


One of your comments says it’s as bad as the n-word. That is categorically untrue and makes too much light of the issues POC face.

Your tone is way too aggressive and this does not help us as a community, but even deepens prejudices. Even your „wtf“ here in the title is over the top. Just calmly inform people about the difference of meaning between HoH and hearing impaired.
Your energy would be way better used with checking out your HoH/deaf friends about politics. As you can see in the linked Thread, very soon the topic HoH versus hearing impaired will be the very least of concerns for the deaf community in the US. Deaf people who voted for Trump cannot complain about anything anymore, they did it to themselves - and sadly to the whole community.

I understand your frustration and it is valid to feel strongly about it.

Still it would be better to educate others in a calm way. Being aggressive might make others aggressive and give them a reason not to listen to you.

We have here sometimes hearing users from India where it's normal to use ""deaf and dumb"" or ""deaf and mute"" to refer to deaf people. It's really unpleasant but I try to remind myself that not everyone was raised or taught the same way we were. All I can do is to keep educating them and raise awareness.

People will use whatever words they are comfortable with. Please don’t take offence by it. You can say “I prefer Deaf or Hard of Hearing”, but in my mind, that they acknowledge my deafness is a win! I grew up in the 70’s and at that time, calling a hard of hearing person “hard of hearing” was considered an insult!

This is not a one size fits all situation. 

Plenty of people refer to themselves as hearing impaired, their friends and family and co-workers hear that and file it away as the proper term to use.  

Instead of getting pissy just say« I prefer the term Deaf » 

As shocking as it is, the people who identify as hearing impaired dislike being called Deaf as much as you dislike being called hearing impaired.

There is also a time and place to make that sentiment. People in that thread that you were rude with were supporting the need for interpreters, instead now their interaction with a deaf person was « wow what an asshole ». Don’t push away people who are trying to support the community by making them out to be a villain in your story.

I have never minded the term. But I dont find the word impairment or disability to be negative in the first place. I use to use it like many hard of hearing people to get hearing people to better appreciate/understand my deafness, as they could only see in blacks and whites of ""Full Deaf"" and ""ahhh its just s little its not that serious"". At the end of the day, thats a constant and fatiguing exchange, so I say whatever gets them to understand the easiest. 


Nowdays I just say I'm deaf. I can respect other people not liking the term impairment - and I'm happy not to use it, so I rarely do now and never just default to it. But in all honesty its still not a term that bothers me. 

And its in no way equivalent to the 'n' word like another commenter said you had suggested.

Man I can’t disagree with you more. I wish society would look at the intent of the persons words more that the actual word. Was the commenter trying to be offensive? No they why let the word bother you. If they said it in a way that was obviously trying to be mean, then sure get upset.

Also not everyone is upset by that term, you don’t speak for everyone. So how would he know when to say it and when not? If he knew you, know you didn’t like the term but used it anyway, that’s a different story.

I know the feeling, I hate the word (Disabled)

I mean, the definition of “impaired” is just “diminished or damaged”, so, yeah? My hearing is impaired. It’s fine to say. But I guess it depends on the person",2025-07-03 13:34:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lqpr1g/hearing_impaired_wtf/
1lqoe8d,deaf,How to politely ask someone to stop interpreting for me?,"I'm Deaf, from a half D/deaf half hearing family, so I grew up with sign language as well as speech and lip reading, and while I have a preference for sign language I'm also fine communicating via text/writing/speech when necessary, and have hearing aids with various tech things to help with different situations. 

I moved country when I was 18 and had to learn a new sign language, I have a friend who has very mild low frequency hearing loss who decided to join me on the courses, which was nice. In the beginning it was fine, but since Covid she's pretty much not left the house, she's not been engaging with any sign language material at all, and she's not practicing anything, but when we go out somewhere together she still ""interprets"" for me - the problem being that I can't really understand her... she signs with English word order, adds in signs that aren't necessary, uses the wrong sign for the context, or just completely the wrong sign, and it's just confusing? I tried paying for some private 1-1 tutor sessions to go back over basics as a refresher for her which we did together but she just doesn't engage with it at all and has an ""I already know all this"" attitude so she half-asses it and doesn't even pay attention to half of it, sometimes I'll ask her questions and she'll just nod at me like she understands but doesn't answer, so clearly doesn't actually understand at all... I'm not sure how else I can try to help her realise that her sign language skills aren't really good, without being mean/rude about it?

Have you tried; ""Please stop interpreting for me.""

I think I understand what you're saying.  Personally,  I probably go ""too far"" to avoid hurting someone's feelings or any kind of confrontation at all.  That said, take her to a deaf event or a meetup.  Guaranteed someone there, maybe more than 1 - will share their opinion of her signing skills or lack thereof.   Whenever my rear end meets the proverbial concrete, experience tells me that doesn't feel great and do what I can to avoid it next time.  Sometimes experience is the best teacher.

mmm it’s weird if she starts interpreting if she can barely have a conversation, but if she has a developmental disorder it might be hard to understand that. do u think she’s like capable of understanding no to interpret?

maybe if you give it some time and keep signing with her so she gets better at it? even if she doesn’t get fluent she might get “fluent enough” with you? i don’t know. the only people i allow to interpret are my parents, so i don’t really know, but i have hearing friends and if it was an emergency or something i would trust they can interpret good enough so it’s not impossible. but like, not if we order a coffee or whatever. that’s just weird.

so yea, i think u should really try to make it clear u don’t want it. if she asks why then just be honest.

If you think necessary remind her before you go somewhere. If she still tries say “please don't interpret for me” and then just don't look at her and keep interacting with the person you trying to interact with. If they try and direct their attention to her not you tell them she's not interpreting for you and please interact with you directly. Don't worry about being rude at this point, they are the ones being rude, you don't have to be mean, but it's not rude to be firm.

For her signing, I think he honest with her, wg “hey I have trouble understanding your signing a lot of the time, are you interested in working on that or would you prefer to communicate another way” and then if she doesn't show any improvement communicate with the way you would a non signing friend. 


And with her understanding try to only ask questions she has to give an actual answer to rather than can say default yes so at least you know if she doesn't understand

As a reminder... people with mental/developmental disabilities can take direct feedback. In fact, they usually do far better with direct feedback than soft feedback like ""you don't need to."" We don't want people to speak for us or assume we can't communicate. I imagine your friend doesn't want you to assume she can't handle a reality check.

What about this format? 

When… (observable fact)
I feel… (your feelings)
Because I am needing… (your core, meta need(s)—*not* want you want from her)
Therefore I now would like… (your request)

For you that might look like telling her:
When you interpret for me, I feel frustrated, because I’m needing clarity and autonomy. Therefore would you stop interpreting for me, I’d prefer to communicate directly with others?

And here’s a [needs wheel](https://nvcnextgen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Needs-Wheel-791x1024.jpg), too

About half the folks on my course still seem to think that British Sign Language is just English using signs instead of a totally separate language. 


Example is using HAVE in the sense of ""do we have to?"" And tryna explain that other languages say things in different ways


English 
I am 100
French
I have 100 years


English
I live in
Irish
I am in my living in


At one point in lesson I said approximating Yoda word order would be somewhat less inaccurate or confusing. 


PETS MY SISTER HAVE 3


confusingly there's also Sign Supported English which DOES use English order. I know enough to know that I'm still not confident in how to piece together signs to convey what I mean clearly. I even see practicr where they will essentially replace an English word with a sign and speak the rest. So it's like DOG .........CAT....... SOUTH ........ kinda meaningless words without context etc. 


I feel like maybe politely isn't the way to go. I mean one can be respectful and firm. I tend to associate politeness with holding back how you really feel. It's not like you've not stated this in a number of ways. It may be that the ""beating around the Bush"" is hindering you. Of course it might be that no matter what you say, it'll never be taken on board in which case not like you didn't try. 


I don't think many would say you'd not made multiple attempts to rectify things. In my mind, I'm wondering what would take, and is that appropriate?

Learn ASL. Make sure that family members and friends are willing to learn some ASL. Be curious, compassionate and considerate. Make sure your child has multiple Deaf role models. I'm deaf but was raised to be oral and ""pass"" as hearing. It really messed up a lot of things for me. My daughter is Deaf as well and she was told over and over that she was lucky to have a deaf parent who ""understood."" One of the best things I ever did was send her to the Deaf school for a year. (living in dorms situation). It was so hard to be away from her but so awesome for her. She got to be around Deaf people who had different tricks to getting by(my way wasn't always the best way), she became fluent in ASL. She finally had peers she related to. The dorm staff were amazing in introducing her to mentors (she wants to go into the medical field). They did so many things that I couldn't do myself. There is no one way to be deaf. Hearing kids get dozens of other hearing people to look up to. Deaf kids deserve similar. 
Other than that, a kid is a kid. A deaf child can do anything just like other kids. Except they might sleep better at night. Lol. 
Enjoy what you can because they really do grow up too fast!

Do not force the kid to wear the cochlear implant. If they are overwhelmed with all the noise, allow them to have a hearing break. Use deaf friendly communication methods like turning on and off the lights to get their attention if they’re out of view or waving your hands when they are. Learn sign language and don’t cover your mouth while talking.

Don’t treat them any differently than you would treat a child with hearing. Let them be normal as possible. Take them to deaf/HOH events to make friends. If they communicate with Sign Language, then learn how to Sign. If they can also communicate verbally, I would suggest taking them to speech therapy. My parents did that for me and I’m very grateful for it. 

For the hearing device, make sure you maintain them, keep dry (not waterproof). Keep money aside for future hearings aids. Since they’re not cheap and pretty much no insurance will cover them.

I'm a hearing parent to a HOH child. In addition to what has already been mentioned (learn sign language, connect with Deaf peers and mentors, etc.), \*please\* listen to Deaf adults. They were once Deaf kids like your child and have so much insight to offer you in understanding your child's experience! In the community of hearing parents of DHH children, I have been really disappointed in how unwilling many hearing parents are to learn from DHH adults.

Interrogate your own ableism and audism. I have definitely had to do this. Your child's deafness is part of who they are and not something that needs to be ""fixed"" or ""cured""! Learn about and think of it as Deaf gain vs. hearing loss.

Learn sign language, and make sure the child has Deaf role models in their life. They will loose part of their identity otherwise. I know you don’t understand why this is true, but it nonetheless is important. You will always be overestimating how well the child hears and copes, so always be aware of that. If the child can get straight As in school with correct support, don’t let anyone bully you into accepting accommodations that aren’t sufficient and that will let the child to just barely cope with a lot of fatigue. Remember that grumpyness and frustration is **not** the child’s personality, but a consequence they are forced into by unrealistic expectations on how easy it is for them to hear. Never, ever, assess a Deaf or HoH person based on their hearing abilities. It’s ok to sign, and it’s ok to do things differently if that leads to more efficient communication for the child.

Small thing, but take the time to learn to get their attention without being rude. Don't be stomping or throwing shit at them.

Let the child decide when and if they want to hear/speak orally.

Do not penalize for anything related to hearing/accommodations  

Learn sign language

Go to deaf meetings so the kid get to meet other kids just like them and also seeing deaf adults to have healthy role models. (Preferably no people with internalized ableism sadly this exist in some cultures and groupings) 

Do not patronize or infantilize the person (as in: treat it as you would a hearing of same age)

Treat child no different than hearing  child  . Don’t think what deaf can and can’t do cuz of deaf !

I do drive all kind and even motorcycles too also drive a stick shift  i am deaf 52 years old guy! My family treat me same as everyone taught me about anything in life

Be present with the child.  Grow with it. 


Like many others has said, learn ASL. Allow them to explore both worlds but mainly their Deaf side like events, play dates with other Deaf peers

Reach out to the community for assistance or guidance 

I would assume you have some background of the child before considering them, and if not, make sure you to ask for it so you know where to go from

More importantly just be present with them

I'm not Deaf, but I noticed my hearing loss at around age 12/13, was given hearing aids and that's it.  Since then it has progressed to severe-profound and hearing aids don't work well anymore aside from allowing me to hear sounds, they are pretty shit for socializing in any normal way and life sucks right now.  They are also hugely expensive and don't last long.

So please, learn ASL and have them in it too, and go to Deaf social events, etc.  The CI is not a cure, it's just an aid, one that is often over-estimated by those without lived experience.  Knowing what I know now I would have been in ASL as soon as the hearing aids went in.  I was too young then to even be aware of such an option. I am angry the audiologist seemingly never suggested it. The ""Industry"" sigh...

Trying to learn later in life is rough.

Learn the sign language for your country. Lot of people on here automatically assuming you’re American.

Some may have said this but i would like to add in a few things   
\- respect their choices if they want the CI off for a bit dont argue

\- learn basic ASL or better yet depending on age / skills maybe take a few classes together 

\- one thing im willing to bet no one has thought of .. and im begging you here .. BUY VISUAL SMOKE ALARMS .. no one ever thinks of making their home deaf friendly till its too late i slept through one smoke alarm so please purchase at least one for their room. 

final tidbit here  i dont know their age / gender please remember some kids dont exactly have the best experience with hearing aids (im late deafened but i will explain in a sec) many kids who are mainstreamed get picked on / teased about hearing devices ... while walking my daughter to school one day a young lad was getting teased by kids ... so i stopped the bullies ... asked them why and of course teasing about the hearing aids .. so i explained yah hearing aids soo bad \*sarcasm\*.. i can always listen to music with no one knowing .. i have spy devices (my roger mics lol), my own language and even better when i have people like you little twerps being annoying i can mute you and best of all .. teacher cant take them away unlike your bluetooth earbuds .. made them rethink a bit 

Take the time to learn about their devices and their compatibility as well they may not be able to hear the TV as well so consider a TV streamer so they can join in fully on movie nights .. and please learn captions are a good idea and include everyone

Dint act irritated when he can’t hear. My family did this. I cut ties with them. I haven’t talked to them in years

I was hard of hearing as a kid and am now Deaf as an adult, I echo the importance of learning to sign and being proactive about introducing your child to the Deaf and hard of hearing community. 

Also to remember that a CI provides access to sound, but often won’t provide the same level of access to clear speech that hearing people have. So I would avoid asking things like “do you have your processor/implant on?” When they may still not understand you. 

Access to language is the most important thing, so you can encourage your child to sign and to wear their CI as well, but make efforts to sympathize that a CI is often uncomfortable, and they may need breaks and often will still need signing even when wearing it. Dual language access can be so powerful!

The fact that you are seeking input from the community is so wonderful, and at the end of the day, being curious enough to learn about your child’s experience from them is what matters most. 😊

1lqdsna,deaf,BASL. Vs ASL,"Hey everyone, I was just wondering if there is a large difference between black American sign language and American sign language?I recently learned about the difference while reading an article. I know BASL stems from segregation but that's about it. Thank you so much for any answers!

[댓글]
If you understand one fluently you can understand the other but there are differences. Some versions of BASL, like what one might see in Philly for example, are basically old traditional ASL with some flare and a few modern add ons. (I mention Philly because while BASL is heavily associated with the South, it’s not only a Southern thing and not 100% all the same across regions anymore than ASL is. The general, widespead local dialect in Philly has BASL influence in it, and there’s been studies where middle and older adult Philadelphia Deaf signers in particular ranked really, really high for using signs that are the same a what Laurent Clerc’s signs were, much higher than the national average.)

https://youtu.be/y7ooYqdEdUY?si=wDhwLfVhex6Sxdkz

Short version: segregation caused two dialects of ASL. 

Medium version: Since the Milan Conference of 1880, Deaf schools stopped teaching sign language to encourage oralism. White kids could afford or were offered the opportunity to trend residential Deaf schools. Black kids weren’t allowed to attend, so they weren’t forced into oralism. As a result, black people used ASL and their language evolved into a distinct dialect called Black ASL.

Why versus? They are two different, separate sign languages in the United States.",2025-07-03 02:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lqdsna/basl_vs_asl/

This looks absolutely horrible I couldn't even make it through the whole trailer. The whole premise is so completely broken it's breaking my brain. TTY calls and really calls are not immune to wiretap, it's not encrypted and there's not even error correction.

1lq5veh,deaf,Conduction tools for a concert,"Hello friends,

I am looking for tips and tools that other deaf and HoH folks have found to help at concerts, particularly in arena (read: huge and all concrete) style buildings.

I have been able to make do with a soda can in the past, but more and more venues are pouring all their drinks, even the ones that originally come in a can, into thin plastic cups and those aren't as helpful. Have any of you had luck with something handheld that doesn't break any venue rules? I am considering a small aluminum tube that I can hold in my palm, but I am worried that the disability coordinator will tell me no to that because it could be perceived as a weapon. 

Other ideas are appreciated! 🩷

No clue if this is allowed, but a balloon works GREAT!
Also a styrafoam cup works surprisingly well too.

I’m guessing you’re talking about the venue’s disability coordinator? Most that I have met would be ok with it. Security is who would have problems. Try reaching out and asking. They may even provide it. 

Side note, if anyone knows how to google so it doesn’t include BAHA, let me know.

1lq2cik,deaf,San Diego Comic Con," know this is a worldwide sub. I know that most people here don’t use ASL. I know that my actions didn’t contribute much. But I helped make a change and I’m proud of it.

San Diego Comic Con is one of the biggest comic conventions in the world and it’s a huge point of pride for San Diegans. It’s also the most Deaf friendly event I’ve ever attended. They hire 40-50 interpreters for the weekend. No need to call two weeks ahead of time. There’s an army of interpreters already there to provide access.

There was an issue. Deaf people were given a “disability access” sticker. Then we waited in the disabled line and were forgotten about. Chairs for the interpreter access area were empty (in a full room) while Deaf were waiting outside. As a community, we brought the problem to the board of directors and implemented a change despite the pushback. Deaf people will get a separate badge sticker allowing them to bypass the lines and fill any Deaf seating that’s open.

As soon as I found out, I told the SDCC Unofficial blog, a news outlet covering the convention. They published the article and I’ve watched it spread in the Comic Con and Deaf news circles.

I also started a sub to represent deaf and disabled SDCC attendees. The SDCC sub has 13 thousand members and no post flair for disability topics. r/SDCCADA is a place for people to discuss and ask questions regarding going to Comic Con with a disability. Again, it’s not much, but I’m proud to be part of the team that helps our community.

1lpw9u3,deaf,My Dad Just Went Completely Deaf — Looking for Tips to Help Him and My Mom Communicate,"Hey everyone,

My dad recently went completely deaf, and it’s been a huge adjustment for both him and my mom. She’s not super tech-savvy, but she’s trying really hard to stay connected and keep communication going. Right now, she’s using a basic transcription app on her phone (like Live Transcribe), it’s a great tool but gets very expensive for the fancy prop transcriptions, so when the 5 hours a month run out it’s tough and they end up forgetting about the app.  

I’m looking for any advice, tips, or even creative low-tech solutions that might help them communicate better. Ideally, something easy enough for my mom to use without needing a bunch of steps. A tablet might be an option, and we’re open to flashcards, gesture systems, or even beginner sign language.

Bonus points if you’ve helped elderly parents in a similar situation — I’d love to know what actually worked for you or your family.

Thanks so much! 
Jay

Learn how to approach in a deaf friendly way, meaning tapping your dad to get his attention, wave in front of his eyes/view, turn lights on and off, stomp your feet, repeat or rephrase if he doesn’t understand, turn on captions on the tv if you haven’t already, make sure you aren’t standing with your back to the light,  look at him, no hands in front of the mouth, no moustache or beard (basically anything that covers the mouth), no yelling if he doesn’t understand or say “never mind” or yelling from another room.

They should take communication seriously and learn sign language. You don’t get too old to learn, they just need to understand it takes time and effort. Trick them into learning by helping them learn signs for things they really want to communicate about. Buy a transcription subscription. Seriously, communication is too important not to pay for that. In your country, when are they entitled to CART/live transcription services?

Learn how to sign, and come up with a plan, understand the situation that can frustrate each other so they need to come up with the plan, immediately. Have he seen audiologist and given him options of hearing aids or cochlear implants. I do mentoring for parents and people that lost hearing immediately.

Both might benefit by keeping a notepad and a pen immediately available. Tempers flare easily.

Hi Jay 

I’m so sorry your dad has gone through this - I myself went deaf overnight literally- I had been fine no cold no illness watched tv went to sleep hearing gone when I woke up I was in hospital within two hours being checked for brain tumour and meningitis both were negative and we still to this day have no idea what caused it that was about 18 years ago. 

It was hard to adjust to the sudden change the silence and then the tinnitus noise that set in. 

Yes you can use notebooks and write to communicate but you end up with pages and pages of paper 
I found these 
LCD Drawing Board, Electronic Notepad LCD Tablet Drawing Pad Business Supplies Hand Painting Tool 9 Inch Writing Tablet Adult (black (with leather case)) https://amzn.eu/d/23rPbFe

This is just one but even the kids one for a few quid work you can write on them, Press a button and screen clears to start again and some are small enough to fit in a bag or back pocket. 

I live alone and based in UK and I now have an ADUK Hearing Dog it was the best thing I ever did - it helped me overcome isolation but I found the charity  fantastic and supportive. 

Another form of communication the charity use is Teams talk and so you can have “zoom meetings “ but it adds subtitles as other speak. - ironically I’ve been hounding the doctors to use this platform as theirs doesn’t have subtitles and there are times when I don’t need to have an appointment just a chat about a small issue etc. but I would look into that. 
 

I had live transcribe on my android but it was free app and I found it worked to a certain degree I could have tv on and if no subs were available the phone translated - yes it missed bits but in hole worked well. It was good if we were in a quiet area with two of us - but more people over talking it couldn’t keep up. So I wasn’t sure what the cost was you talked of. 

I have found the speech app on the iPhone 15 pro much improved and can now dictate my text/what’s up etc but you can use it in notes so it maybe something they could utilise. 

I would also look into sign too - I’ve notice more and more places have someone who can sign. 

 I wish them all the best and hope they find a solution.

I would heavily encourage sign language. You can take classes at your local community college. 

For me, enrollment also came with a subscription for otter.ai

Look for free transcription/translation apps they can use all month. E.g. Microsoft Translate

Look into Ubi-Duo. They are covered by Medicaid/Medicare.

Thanks everyone for all the great tips. What’s difficult is that my mom is 86 and dad will be 89. Dad has been through so much brain cancer treatments. Fortunately he’s doing well, but he’s a lot slower than he was and teaching him is difficult. For my mom she’s doing well but since covid she’s been nursing my dad a lot and it’s taken a toll on her energy and she’s slowed down. I’d love for them to learn ASL and I will try to teach them some basics after I learn a bit. I just want them to be as happy and comfy as they can be, it’s these little tips and tricks that can very much help. Thank you everyone :)

The other advice here has covered a lot of good stuff. Only saw one thing that I think would set them back, so really good for the internet, eh?

I will add: I have run into multiple instances of late-deafened people who are Really Very Resistant to learning ASL. If your dad falls into this category, then it might be good to talk about sim-com, PSE, or even (ack) SEE skills. Then they won't be scared off by the foreign grammar or whatever, but will still pick up some ability to have basic-level communication with people who do have ASL because of overlapping vocabularies. I've noticed that when I start using sim-com, it tends to grow on those ""I'm Hearing, I just can't hear"" people in a way that is less threatening for them for whatever reason.

learning ASL in addition to using transcribing apps will be helpful too. in the long run when your parents become more comfortable with signing, there'll be less need for transcribing apps and it can be used ""as needed"". transcribing apps are not intended to replace communication, its a tool.

If your mother still has good dexterity in her hands then Cued Speech it the easiest option for them.  Your mother needs to learn how to cue and your father needs to learn how to read the cues but they should be able to communicate adequately in a couple of weeks.

Why does your mom need transcription,  as presumably dad can still speak?

1lprxmj,deaf,"Born Deaf, Mainstreamed, and Finding My Way Home","Hi everyone,
I was born deaf but grew up mainstreamed without any exposure to Deaf culture or ASL. Even though I was surrounded by hearing people most of my life, I’ve always felt Deaf at heart — like something deep in me was missing until I started learning more about the Deaf community.

I’m not curently learning ASL but want to badly and want to connect more with the community, both online and eventually in person. I know I have a lot to learn, and I want to do it with humility and respect. If you have any advice, resources, or thoughts for someone like me who’s reconnecting with their Deaf identity, I’d really appreciate it.

Thank you for welcoming people like me. I’m excited (and a little nervous) to finally say this out loud: I feel like I’m coming home.

I was able to have some hearing for twenty years after surgeries as a kid (not CIs) and when I had medical care. Now I can't get any medical person to take care of my ears or hearing but they want to implant me with BAHAs. So now I'm back to losing my hearing without any access to visual language which I need! I'm also waiting for insurance to approve a soft band and am wearing AirPods 2 as hearing aids.


Thanks for reading. Throw in your 2 cents please!

Get involved learning signing, go to your local Deaf community

Keep us posted on your progress. There are many mainstreamed deaf in similar situations

There are some online options for classes that you can take from home if you have reliable internet. The one I work with (as a teacher) has a pretty good mix of D/HH people and hearing ones.  That doesn't totally eliminate the childcare angle, but we have had some parents with kids who join sometimes. 

BAHAs aren't by themselves terrible - they're a good option for those who aren't candidates for CIs for various reasons.

My experience is really similar to yours, and I do recommend googling your area to see if there are any nearby deaf events, as well as signing classes. Sometimes the local library offers free basic signing classes that can get you started. There are also lots of great YouTube videos for learning to sign!

Lifeprint.com
Also, a local deaf school or center may offer mentors. As much as I hate Facebook, you may community events for ASL.

1lpp9s2,deaf,"Brother rejecting deaf culture, school and becoming more and more upset, what can we do?","So background. Family is half hearing half deaf. Mother and two sister hearing, me and my other sister deaf and then the youngest is our sole brother who is deaf. Me, my sister and Brother are first language ASL thanks to my mom’s determination, everyone else can speak anywhere from okay to almost great. 

We all went to the same elementary school that had good support for us and understood our issues well,  but it wasn’t a deaf school. 

So me and my sister were fortunate that during elementary school we were told we were viable for CIs and we both got them. Unfortunately due to some complications during pregnancy I think our brother turned out to not be viable for CIs.

Me and my sisters have all gone to the same schools after elementary school. However my mother wants my brother to attend deaf schools. This has brought up a lot of issues and changed my brother. 

He wants to go to the same schools we go to, however these schools who have been great have explained that they have concerns about admitting him into the schools, they are in contact with the deaf school and have a relationship and are saying he would be much more comfortable at the deaf schools. Now my mom supports this as does everyone else.

Another issue was his best friend also recently as in about a year ago got a CI and will be going to a hearing school as well. 

Well my brother cried, screamed and had a tantrum. It’s not fair, why him, why can’t he be like everyone else, why can’t he be “cured” like us, he hates deaf this, deaf that, doesn’t want to be deaf etc etc and it’s hard to watch and it hurts. 

Just to be clear we have explained we are not “cured” we are still deaf, we also make time for him as his deaf family and do activities together, we often don’t use CIs when we are with him so he doesn’t feel excluded. We tell him over and over there is nothing wrong with being deaf, he can do anything. 

He’s super sweet, soft and everyone’s biggest fan but it feels like now he is starting to see the huge split that exists between being hearing or having the chance to kind of hear and being completely deaf. It just looks to be in so much pain emotionally. 

It feels like he sees us joining the hearing world and abandoning him but that’s not it all or at least how I want him to feel, we are still involved in the deaf community but we also joined some clubs with hearing people and gained hearing friends. It’s been nice making friends with people not exposed to deafness and educating them, I have introduced them to my brother and they love him and he seemed to have so much fun with them teaching them ASL, playing etc so I thought it was all good. 

Honestly getting the CI and my sister agreed, felt good with the idea of “okay more of us can hear in the family now and help look out for each other”. I thought we were extending his support network and world not shrinking it. 

Now we are speaking with a counselor both as a family and him personally.

I just wondered has anyone here ever had a similar experience? What did you do?

Has anyone here had a period where they felt ashamed? Or angry? What advice do you have to help get past that?

The deaf school have been in touch and want him to go visit and see them but he just throws and tantrum and tells us over and over he won’t go. My mom is wondering, would it be a good idea to just adult the decision and take him there and enroll him at the deaf school or would that make it worse? 

Or do we give in and put him in hearing school? That seems like a bad idea but it’s what he wants but no one really supports that idea at all. 

I am so proud to be deaf, as is my sister and so was my brother until all of this. Families is just so depressed now. 

I have lurked here a long time so thank you for your patience and any advice you can give. Sorry this is really long.

I empathize with your brother deeply. I was born Deaf to a hearing family and struggled with my identity between the hearing and Deaf world. Reading this I feel the weight of what your family is going through, and I see how hard you all are working to support him.

While I’m not him, I can speak from my experiences growing up that can maybe help in some way.

It’s not easy being a kid and feeling left behind, especially when it seems everyone is moving into a world you’re not invited to. 
He’s likely grieving what he thinks he’s missing, not just hearing, but inclusion and sameness with his family and best friend. 

Nearly every d/Deaf person I’ve met has struggled with this at some point in their lives, it’s a deep pain when Deaf kids internalize the idea that to be “better” or to be enough, they need to be hearing - or as close to it as possible. 

CIs aren’t the issue, but the message he’s absorbed (whether from the world, school, media, or small daily experiences) is that hearing = belonging = value. That’s where his heartbreak is coming from. He’s still so young, and he hasn’t had time to build the strong Deaf identity that many of us grow into later. 
His path isn’t exactly the same as yours or your sister’s, even if it looks similar. When I felt like that, no matter what anyone said, I was stuck. All you can do is build an environment that supports him and do your best.

I was placed in hearing schools before I had access to full language and support, I hated it but I tried so so hard. I did years of speech therapy, lip reading, and burning out from the stress and lack of accessibility.

Even when I was “getting by” and doing the same as he did, teaching others ASL, making hearing friends, it only went so far. I was always different, and I just wanted to be normal. To be hearing.

Later, I was switched to a Deaf school, and at first it felt like I had lost. Being sent there felt like a punishment, that I was “too Deaf” to be part of the hearing world. Then, as I started to make connections, really living and having fun, it clicked. 
My teacher and my friends all spoke the same language, and I understood it. I wasn’t the Deaf kid, I was just a kid. I felt powerful, I felt normal, and I felt free. 

My anger wasn’t at my deafness, but at being left out. Above all else, it was the lack of control I had over everything. 

He might not accept that right now, and that’s okay. He needs to feel these things, but don’t give up the message that he’s never less than, and not left behind.

It’s a hard choice, but in my opinion, forcing him into a hearing school against professional recommendations could be more damaging than helping him ease into the Deaf school. But you also don’t want to hurt him by taking away what control he has, and dragging him to a place he associates with loss.

My advice, talk with him as an equal and give him choices - even if they’re not the big ones. It’s not about giving him control, it’s about reminding him he has a say in his life.
Having choices can help him feel part of the process, not just affected by it, and hopefully help him build more emotional control to accept limits on bigger decisions

Talk with the school and see if he can attend a Deaf summer program, camp, or visit with you and your sister. 

Intentionally introduce him to kids and adults who are proudly Deaf without CI’s, show him there’s a full and vibrant life on the other side of what he’s afraid of.

If possible, find a Deaf counselor or therapist. Having someone to really talk to who doesn’t just understand it, but lives it makes a world of a difference.

Lastly, if I had to say anything to him, I’d tell him I didn’t always love being Deaf. Many of us didn’t. We’ve all had our “I wish I could hear moments”, especially as a kid when I just wanted to belong.

But one day, for many of us, it flips. I became more comfortable in myself, my community, and identity. Eventually he’ll realize he doesn’t need to hear to be whole, and that Deafness isn’t a barrier. 

When I was a kid and said “I hate being Deaf”, I didn’t want to be told that Deafness was this great thing, I wanted someone who hated it as much as I did. I wanted someone to tell how unfair it felt and have them really understand. Deep down, I wanted to move through those feelings, but I was stuck because I didn’t know what to do with them.

I’m so happy he has a family that signs, and someone that cares about him enough to ask for advice. This isn’t easy, and it like won’t be for a while, but you’re showing up for him and that means a lot. I’m certain he’ll see that, even if it takes time. 🤟🏼

Exactly how old is your brother? 

I grew up mainstreamed, but with a fairly large group of other DHH kids so I felt comfortable enough -- but looking back I do think I would have enjoyed things more at a Deaf school.  I currently teach in a mainstream high school and I fully admit that many of my students would be better served in a fully Deaf-accessible environment.  If there was a school close enough to me, I would be applying there! 

As others have said, he is not really reacting to not being able to hear, but to being ""othered"" - separated further from his family and friends.  

All of the good Deaf schools have support systems for new students, PLUS a ""probation"" period for adjustment. Some have summer programs.  The one in my state partners with neighborhood schools for things like sports and clubs, so there's a lot of interaction between schools.  If he is still resistant, he could try the regular school but try and join some of the ""distance"" clubs and activities (robotics club for instance) to get his foot in the door in the community at the school.  The chance to go visit would be BIG.  I never really thought about how much the environment impacts us until I recently went to RIT for training and nearly everyone I met could sign and I realized how much more relaxed I was there even in a wildly unfamiliar location. 

See if you can sit down with your brother and tell him bluntly that you love him and want him to learn the best way that he can so that he can be as successful as possible when he graduates.  Encourage him to go visit (with friends, with you, whoever he identifies as a safe person) and try to keep an open mind. Ask him to tell you what his priorities are right now - social stuff? Understanding classwork? etc.  If he wants to talk to a ""neutral"" party, encourage him to reach out to Teachers of the Deaf NOT at the institute.  (E.g. people like me) - they can give a more objective point of view and discuss points he may not have thought of.

I'm actually pleased that the schools are recommending that he try the Deaf school rather than being like ""Oh sure we'll take this Deaf kid and give them an interpreter, everything will be fine!""

Firstly just want to say that you are great siblings. 

Also this is all very understandable. 

Its hard to comment helpfully without knowing your brothers level of deafness and type of loss. 

Me and my brother were born with a severe to profound progressive deafness and went to mainstream schools. We have a high frequency / classic 'ski slope' loss. Neither of us were integrated into Deaf Culture, and its something Im trying to connect with now in my early 30s. 

Being or feeling ""inbetween"" the hearing world and the Deaf world and also feeling a part of neither has its own challenges and frustrations. Your brother will be ok whichever path is chosen, but just how much they will struggle in either school (academically, socially, culturally) may depend on their level of deafness?

Oh, poor little guy. He is too small to really understand the consequences of selecting school. Of course he wants to be like you. You definitely can tell him that he at least must visit the two schools to see what it’s like. Checking things out properly before deciding is not negotiable. You can also assure him that if things are not working your well, then the decision can be reconsidered. He will never be stuck in a school just for trying it out. It’s a bit late, but for future families in similar situations, I’d simply make sure he already had friends going to the Deaf school. 

Going to school can be tough moment for hearing kids too. 

He is so little, that I’m sure a good experience and getting friends could turn him around. Maybe just be there for him, listen to him, help him find words to reflect on it all. Tell him that school is important, and that being able to communicate easily in school will help him learn things, get friends, get good grades later and so on. You could promise him some other activity with hearing people, to make him feel more part of two worlds.

It’s such an interesting complication of getting CI:s. Those who can’t have them in the future will definitely feel lonely, and the issue will likely increase by the year. I think I would be more worried when he approaches the teenage years. That’s such a sensitive age for feeling excluded.

Each has to find their own way and community.  I meet with many people who've been forced against their will and may have conflicts with their family or their very identity later in life. Not an easy path for anyone involved.    

School districts like saving money on accommodations... They are not the best advocates as they are looking at the bottom line.

I would recommend he has continued connections with both worlds, separate but equally respected.. he might have experienced bias or prejudice.

it's so normal to want to stay with family and siblings, but he will need that ASL in his schooling regardless.  Try to visit the Deaf school often and go to community events and get ASL in his school for a year. Or vice versa...but consider it a trial instead of a life sentence.  Then he can make an informed decision.

I've been profoundly deaf in both ears since 3, due to illness.  My mom mainstreamed me from day 1 - never looked back.  Like u/FlyLikeMouse, I was never accepted by the hearing world or the deaf.  The hearing because I was deaf, and the deaf because I never learned to sign or got involved with the deaf culture.  I wouldn't say I rejected it, but left it to the side like the way a high school kid leaves home to pursue college.  The amount of effort it takes for a deaf person to succeed in a hearing world takes a strength that frequently leaves one wondering if they possess it.  

My mom built a team of people to surround me.  A speech therapist, and 2 counselors who made sure I did my homework, met with the teachers to gauge my progress and address any issues.  This was not provided by the school, but a team my mom built and the school agreed to onboard.  It truly starts at home, with the parents.  With that said-

It sounds like your brother might have that strength.  How bad does he want it?  How bad do your parents want it? Would your mom be willing to put in endless time and energy towards his speech therapy, homework, etc?  Personally, I believe a ""burn the boats"" mentality is required for a deaf kid to succeed in a hearing world.  If you have no recourse, no sign language to lean on - you might be amazed and what one can accomplish.   You could try this for 1 year.  If it turns out to be too much for all parties involved, you can reboot.  

It was an endless fight for my mom to keep me in mainstream schools.  Every year there would be teachers that would object.  With new schools, the principal would object.  I went to high school in the 90's, and even then they tried to get me to go to a deaf school even though I speak pretty clearly and don't have a speech impediment.  I would've had to learn an entire sign language and and get adjusted to the deaf world while keeping up with my studies.  Personally, I think that would've been a disaster for me that late in the game.  

Today, I have a college degree and an MBA. I have a great job.  I'm married to a hearing wife.  The hearing world is still challenging.  I'm even looking at learning to sign because my hearing wife has loved ASL since she was a kid and knows more than her deaf husband does.  So I might just  learn with her and maybe even reach out to the deaf world to see what that's about.  

It can be done.  I'm nobody special - just a guy that endured what it took to succeed.  There are others like me.  He can do this!

When I was young, I went to a secondary school I loved (I am British) and then in my first year, it was announced that the school would be closing and three local schools would become one school. My mother didn't like that for various reasons, ""adulted the decision"", and sent me to a different school I didn't want to go to. I went there angry with a negative mindset, the teachers didn't bother to ask why, they just turned against me and the whole thing went downhill from there. It was absolutely terrible, a miserable traumatic experience.

Your brother is not having a tantrum, he is grieving because everyone he knows and loves has some degree of hearing and he got none and now he is running into a consequence; ""losing"" his best friend and going to a school where he knows no-one. I know you know this, but I really dislike you using the word ""tantrum"" because this isn't unreasonable anger or bratty behaviour, this is genuine pain.

Everyone needs to stop talking at him and deciding for him. Sit down with him, tell him you know he's in pain, and let him talk and don't interrupt or tell him what's best for him. All that will do is entrench him further in his position. If you can finish just one conversation without telling him why he ought to go to deaf school, at least he will feel like you have respected his point of view instead of just telling him why he's wrong.

If he won't go to the deaf school, can the deaf school come to him? Would a teacher be willing to visit, could you find some kids that will be going to his school and bring them to your house to meet him? 

If he is really unshakeable, then I would make a deal with him: if he goes to the deaf school and looks around and still says no, you will respect that and let him try the hearing school and he will always have the option to change his mind and go to the deaf school. If he does go to hearing school, then do everything you can to help him make friends who are deaf... but the truth is, your mother should already have done that so that he never got into a situation where everyone he knew was hearing or using a CI and he would have to give them up to go to the deaf school.

It doesn't matter what you think is best for him, you are completely right, and that doesn't matter either. What matters is if he goes in with an attitude of ""I hate being deaf and I hate being here"" then he's going to fail and be miserable. So if you can't change that, then let him forge his path but make it clear to him that you will never say ""I told you so"" if he decides it's too much for him.",2025-07-02 07:04:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lpp9s2/brother_rejecting_deaf_culture_school_and/
1lplgwn,deaf,Update: ever okay for ASL Interpreters to be in a supervisory role- we got it taken out!,"

I wanted to give an update on this:    https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/s/Qs6RVnN2AS

Sorry if it's formatted weird I'm on mobile.

 Tldr: during contract negotiations school district attempted to add language to try and put ASL Interpreters in a supervisory role. Even after we said no and it wasn't okay they wanted to add the language in. 

For the next meeting I had reached out to an ASL Interpreter who gave a statement. I also went through links and sites that were sent to me and had a statement prepared with receipts on why it's not okay and that what they wanted was unethical. 

And we got it! They said they wouldn't try to put it in!

Thank you to everyone who commented! It was a big help!

Hi, Deaf here! Absolutely! I can’t believe no one’s mentioned one of the best ways to learn!

Dr. Bill Vicars is an AMAZING professor who creates free resources and videos for learning ASL. 
Hands down the easiest way to learn on your own, it’s straightforward and you learn along with his guest student throughout the lessons! 

His dictionary is also incredibly intuitive and easy to use - learning through the internet is great but definitely consider connecting with the local community or in person events.

Try and learn from Deaf creators and native signers, avoid people who aren’t qualified and just want to sell you their book. 
YouTube, Facebook, local, and government resources will be your best points of contact.

As a person who has been dating someone who is fully deaf 11 months ago. And I have no experience with sign language before meeting her. I would say that I can hold decent conversation and what I have found is that repetition is what helps most. Things like what, where, why, how, when. And knowing particular verbs help a lot. But you going to have to use this in Daily conversation on a regular basis to fully immerse yourself

You absolutely can! Colleges usually have ASL classes available you can audit if there is one near you. Sometimes they're hosted at public libraries or community centers. Or perhaps search online for local ASL classes. You might even meet some deaf people too.

There’s an ASL subreddit that has other resources.

Which country are you? Different countries can have different signs.

Hello, Deafie here! 
I was hearing growing up until 2021 and my deaf gene kicked in.
I am pretty good
Signing songs is my favorite way of learning.

ASL Bloom, Lingvano Sign Language, Sign School website, Drunk Hands is taught by deaf teachers there's also a discord group that meets weekly or monthly 
TikTok is a great way to learn. Oklahoma School for the Deaf has classes ASL 1 and 2.

YouTube is also a good way to learn, you can also follow some deaf creator's Instagram and TikTok.

Hope this helps 🙏🏽 

You can also go to deaf events

Yes, you can learn it!  And any HoH/deaf you meet will probably be suprised and happy that you can communicate with them, if they know sign language! I am deaf and prefer to speak, but it makes me happy when someone is able to sign a little in big groups. It's very overstimulating in these situations, and it someone can sign, I will appreciate them so much.❤️

I am SSD and took some ASL classes in Manhattan.  A lot of the other students were actors who said the facial expressions with ASL helped their craft.

sign language is the easiest language to learn. the signs make total sense, making it easy to retain.

Don't rely on hearing people to teach you ASL. They are always flawed. Seek Deaf people instead of hearing people.

Nvidia does it

Google Nvidia asl sign on Google. They have 4 levels of basic asl. Its pretty cool uses your computer camera and ai to detect your accuracy",2025-07-02 03:14:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lpldss/can_i_learn_sign_language/

1lp3ll0,deaf,TTY/RTT Help,"Got severe muscle weakness that kneecaps my ability to type/research; would be greatful for any insight or advice on how to make calls that actually work.

I’ve used TTY option on my cell phone to make calls for years. It honestly sucks (relayers struggle to summarize menu options before calls disconnect, sk doesn’t work, calls drop all the time, esp. during long holds) but it’s all I have access to and need something lightweight/portable.

My new phone doesn’t have a TTY option anymore—it has RTT. I can call/type to 711 pretty much exactly the same but still run into the same issues. It also doesn’t work how my wireless company told me, where I can use it to call numbers directly (neither people nor menus can see what I type unless I call 711 and have them call the number I need to reach).  Worse, (not sure if this is just coincidence since my schedule changed) but I keep getting a damn busy signal for 711.

At a loss of how to make important calls. When I call early I get a busy signal from 711, if I call later I wait on hold till places close because everyone else is already queued up. I know there are TTY devices but was informed they’re stationary/not portable. What are my portable options? Pulling my hair out in frustration here. Being able to call TTY numbers directly for the rare businesses that have the option would save me so much time. 711 TTY to TTY calls don’t work at all.

Edit: Still looking for suggestions! Participating in BDS so Israeli companies collecting a shit ton of personal info is a hard no for me.

He cannot hear on the phone and if talking to him in person, you have to talk fairly loud right in his ear.

I am having major issues because I need to help him with his computer over the phone. I had been using TeamViewer but have been 'kicked off' because their 'algorithms' show that I am working as a business (?!?!). This has happened 3-4 times in the past couple of years and every time I've had to go thru a certain process to tell them I'm not (a business... in fact, I rarely used TeamViewer at all, maybe a grand total of about 100 hours for a year, for 2 people (Father and Mother-in-Law). 

I've told them I'm finished, and have installed a new program. 

The problem is that I can't get him to follow along in an instruction sheet that I sent him. He can't hear most of what I tell him, and I try to email him with further instructions but he doesn't always hear me tell him I sent a new email.

At one time he had a text-phone (internet-based) but apparently there was some problem using it, so it's gone.

1lobyhw,deaf,Two Gains and a Bing,"Last weekend, my wife and I went to our first Broadway show with interpreters. The show was scheduled to be interpreted. Tickets were sold at a special rate for deaf patrons. 

Gain 1: the community. There were several people to chat with before the show started. The interprets walked around so they had an idea of how many/where we were sitting. I’ve met the interpreters at other events so I knew the quality before the show. 

Gain 2: the access. I knew the basic story of the show (based on a movie). But the interpreters made it so I understood all the changes for the stage version. I understood the quick jokes. The songs were interpreted in ways that made me think about their meaning. 

The Bing: at curtain call, the cast performed an “Encore” medley of songs. The audience gave a standing ovation. The sight line to the interpreters was blocked. Now I’m looking up the show to see what songs were mashed together. 

Overall, it was a great experience! I’m looking forward to a couple other interpreted shows. The whole thing was just KISSFIST (ASL sign).",2025-06-30 16:25:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lobyhw/two_gains_and_a_bing/
1lnuok8,deaf,Need help navigating a complex situation,"Edit: This post was not well received by many users. I posted here because I was hoping to get advice from people who became deaf/HH later in life about how to maintain friendships with hearing folks. 

It seems that some users believe that people with hyperacusis are not similar in any way, shape or form to deaf/HH folks. While both groups have unique experiences, I think there are meaningful similarities when it comes to accomodations, functional limitations, and different access barriers. 

At the end of the day, in many contexts, society doesn't differentiate between hyperacusis and hypoacusis. If someone can't use spoken communication to socialize, they're simply left out. Likewise, the development of better real-time transcription tools benefits both groups - whether someone has hyperacusis or hypoacusis makes no difference in that regard.

Personally, I think it's best for all of us to focus on our shared struggles and look for ways to support one another. As disabled people, we're all navigating a world that wasn't built with us in mind, where we're regularly treated as an afterthought. The very least we can do is acknowledge that we're on the same team and care for one another. 

---

Hi everyone. I have hyperacusis, which means that, under certain circumstances, I experience similar functional limitations as deaf/HoH people. I'm having trouble navigating a difficult, saddening situation, and I think that you guys might be able to help me out with some advice or guidance. Long post ahead.

I developed hyperacusis last year and managed to recover to a significant degree, for example, I was able to have hours-long conversations through voice chat. During this time, I started talking to a guy online, and we immediately clicked. For a few months, we spoke for hours almost every week and that's how we became friends. I was very happy to have met him because, even though our life experiences were very different, we shared similar values and outlooks on life. I'm virtually friendless, so he became effectively my closest friend.

He was open from the beginning that he didn't text much and that he preferred voice chatting, and I was okay with that. On a few occasions, we did text with the habitual back and forth, but it wasn't a regular occurrence like our calls were.

At some point, I noticed that we were on different wavelengths when it came to certain things. For example, a couple of times I shared something challenging that had happened to me via text... only to get no response. This hurt, but I understood that, for some reason, that was his natural reaction, so I never brought it up and just refrained from sharing certain things over text since they might go unanswered. I’d say that I’m more sensitive and considerate of other people’s feelings than he is, and this matters, as you’ll see in a moment. Fwiw, his personality type is INTJ.

Talking every week had become part of our routine until in march I had a setback and my hearing was affected, which meant that I was no longer able to voice chat. I let him know about the setback (I had told him about my hyperacusis before) by messaging him 'Hey, I won't be able to have calls for now. I'll let you know when I'm feeling better.' At first, I expected that it would take a few weeks to recover, but that didn't happen. This is when things started falling apart. 

Since then, about once a month, he’s asked me how I’ve been doing and I let him now (‘I’m still struggling’ / ‘Oh, that’s tough. I hope you get better’). Other than that, there's been no communication whatsoever, and eventually I started feeling very disappointed and frustrated for a few reasons:  

1. Hyperacusis is incredibly challenging, and I wish I had gotten some kind of support from him that I never received. 

2. There was never any type of acknowledgement about the situation on his end. It would've been incredibly uplifting and comforting to get a message that said 'Hey, I'm sorry you're going through this and for the effect it's had on our relationship, since our dynamic has always been through voice chat. I just wanted to let you know that you're my friend regardless, that I care about you, and that I hope we can find a way to stay connected.'

3. This whole situation makes me feel really icky. It seems like my friend is only interested in keeping in touch with me as long as I'm not too disabled, and that bothers me a lot. For all intents and purposes, I think this is an instance of accidental/involuntary ableism. I deserve better than this, and a part of me honestly thinks that he's just not the kind of friend I need.

At the beginning of may, he asked me if I had made any progress. I replied 'still struggling, but we can chat for about 40 minutes one of these days', because my hearing was somewhat better. I was feeling a bit hopeful when I wrote that. I thought ‘well, this time for sure we’ll be able to chat and I’ll finally get to know what my friend’s been up to. It’s been such a long time since we last talked!’ But… it took him a month to reply. This had never happened before, and it really hurt. His reply said 'sorry for my prolonged absence. I hope you're doing ok/better. Hopefully a month has cured you!'

This was a couple of weeks ago. His message left me speechless. I just felt sad and uncomfortable, and I chose not to reply. 

So, this is the situation. 

I miss my friend. We used to spend hours talking about philosophy, spirituality, languages, and many other topics. I miss the relationship we had. At the same time, I'm really hurt, sad, and disappointed. I feel like I've been treated poorly, and I'm not even sure I'm still interested in pursuing this friendship.

I happen to be severely disabled (I'm a wheelchair user), and he never had an issue with that. However, the moment it’s something that somehow ‘inconveniences’ him, he seems okay with putting our friendship on hold for months on end. This feels so wrong, even disgusting. I don’t need any more sources of suffering in my life. I take pride in being disabled. It’s really hard, but I try to accept my life for what it is. I deserve friends who truly care about me and whose behavior shows that. 

I'm under the impression that, on his end, things are perfectly fine, that this whole time he's just been waiting for me to recover so that things can go back to the way they used to be. That really bothers me. It’s understandable, especially at first - even I thought the same thing. But once it became clear that my recovery would take a longer time, his approach never changed. This was hurtful and disappointing, and I was already dealing with a lot IRL, so I chose to ignore the situation and not say anything. 

I’m now realizing that it would’ve been best if I had kept an eye on the situation, and once months began passing, I could have been open about how I was doing and what my needs were at the time. Maybe if I'd communicated that in a timely manner, he wouldd’ve been more accomodating. Anyway, the question is… what should I say to him now?

What do you think about this whole situation? Is the relationship salvageable? Do you think it's worth salvaging? I'm really hurt, but I don't want to 'cancel' him. I want to approach this with openness while staying true to myself, and see how things develop from there. 

I'd really appreciate your advice and compassion. The last few months have been incredibly difficult for me, and losing a close friend on top of everything has just made everything harder. 

Thank your for reading.

Captions for your unvoiced thoughts should not go in the same place where sounds and speech are captioned. That will clutter the information stream. You could place your “thought captions” at the top of the screen or anywhere else that it won’t be confusing.

Yes as a person who relies on CC, please keep the text distinct between dialogue and non spoken.

I've seen others doing it for different purposes. It would be just added text or annotations and not really CC.

So feel free to be creative with text.

Please only use captions for anything that actually happens in audio. A good way to include your thoughts would be to put the text on the video itself! :)

I watch YouTube videos that only have captions with no spoken audio all the time. ASMR restorations of old game consoles and toys. Travel vlogs in Japan where there’s only ambient audio. 

I’m deaf and I’m totally fine with this usage.

Check out Myfordboy's youtube channel. He does model engineering and never voiced over his video, relying on natural background sounds and captions explaining what he does. https://www.youtube.com/@myfordboy/videos

Just as long as the audio captions are different from the thought captions (different area on the screen, different font, different colour etc) then I don’t see a problem, as long as the audio captions are still present and are obviously the main focus

He reinforces the signs that I’ve been teaching our son (2yo now). Which I appreciate.

Your ability to learn and pick up a visual language will depend on how you’re learning (app/youtube/class/tutor), if you pick up visual concepts easily (my husband is an auditory learner and learns best through hearing and explaining concepts aloud. So he struggled a little bit… but he was able to learn!), and how often you actually sign (you lose what you don’t use).

Jump in a class and go for it! You won’t regret it :)

I’m a mostly deaf HA user, husband is hearing.

I am deaf, and my boyfriend is hearing.
He learned ASL after meeting me but I also get along pretty well with hearing aids so if they're in, it's quiet, and he's facing me he can speak of he doesn't know how to sign something. Otherwise we usually sign. I can speak fine so if I need to talk I do (ex. Getting his attention from another room, talking to his family, etc.) 

I'm the first deaf/HH person he's ever been with but it hasn't been an issue whatsoever, we're just like a normal couple. We just communicate a little differently sometimes.

I'm hearing impaired and wife is hearjng

Deaf and hearing.

I'm the deaf one.

I was born deaf in my right ear and HoH in my left. I’m even more HoH now. I’ve been married for 38 years. I was mainstreamed and don’t sign. He had a stroke when he was 28 and will never be able to sign. We do alright, but again, we’ve been married forever. 

We met in high school and I recently asked him if my deafness was an issue for him back then and he said that it wasn’t.

We are. I've got a CI that works pretty well, so it's a pretty standard communication setup, outside of showering and sleeping (obviously don't wear CI at those times).

I am profoundly deaf in both ears (since about 3) and wear a cochlear implant on my right ear.  I do not know ASL.  My wife is hearing.  Oddly enough, she knows some ASL due to her being interest in ASL before we met.  She wants me to learn ASL but I don't know how I feel about that..",2025-06-28 21:43:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lmy785/mixed_couple/
1lmsctg,deaf,dating while deaf: when do you talk about it?,"hello! to give some background info to my question: i’m 24 years old, and a little more than a year ago i suddenly lost all hearing in my right ear and became hoh in the left in an accident. i’ve recovered physically since then and i’d like to try dating again, but it’s been intimidating to say the least 😅 

my main struggle is that i’m not sure how early on to “disclose” my deafness. i am on the apps and don’t currently have anything about it on my profile, but every time i’ve matched with a woman lately and mentioned it before the first date to be upfront, she immediately ghosts and never speaks to me again. i would never blame anyone for not wanting to date me over that, because of course that’s their right, but i can’t pretend that it doesn’t also sting a little to be so aware of the reason.

so, what do you all think/what do you do yourself? is this something i should be putting on my dating profile? mentioned on the first date? after? thanks for reading :)

I tell people immediately. 

I'm also Deaf, there's no HH about it. 

How badly does it impact your communication and communication needs?

If it's bad enough you need constant accommodations, I'd be upfront about it so your date is prepared.

Some people might feel it's too much work and if they do, it's better to discover before you pay for their dinner.

On the first date. 
You don't need to put it in a dating profile, but you can leave clues.

I don't bring it up. I show up to the date, if they notice it and bring it up, then I talk about it. This is one of those issues where you leave it be unless they find an issue with communicating with you. But if you only communicate in ASL you need to bring that up.

I always have one photo in my profile that shows my CI …. But it is not my lead photo… I don’t mention it in my profile, after all I am not my disability there are more interesting things about me than that… if we start communicating back-and-forth and things feel comfortable and there are plans to meet… somewhere in that time. I mention it so that they don’t feel ambushed when they meet me… and if it’s a dealbreaker then it is a courtesy that is good for us both, I don’t end up wasting time on the connection

[removed]

I’m HOH I don’t think I’ve mentioned but maybe in preference of a quieter first date location it might of come up.

{Im Deaf} 

When i was dating on the apps, I usually go a few days first without disclosing it to check out the energy and vibes to decide if it is worth disclosing to this person, like is this someone i actually want to meet up with? do they seem really cool and that they wouldn't go as far as trying to make me feel bad about it or put the burden of communicating on me? If they check all that then I try to disclose as soon as we start making plans, i usually say something like ""hey I just want to let you know so that there are no surprises when we first meet, but i am deaf and i cannot hear at all. But Im willing to use note app to help with communication and meet up to see where things goes, if you are still interested then im so excited to meet up but i do understand if this is something that you can't see yourself moving past""

Most of the time, I get really good and kind responses -- They become more curious and it can lead to meaningful discussions, but do brace yourself for the breed that ask the typical stupid questions- ""if you are deaf, can you still listen to music? can you read? can you? can you?"" I try to approach these questions respectfully and with patience because sometimes they are not trying to be offensive, they just genuinely know nothing about the deaf community. If they are the right person, they will be willing to work with you and figure out a comfortable way to communicate for the both of you. It took me a while to get through all of the wrong ones and im happily in a relationship with my current hearing partner.

Need to be upfront. No point in wasting either of your time.

I like to bring it up early on either when your talking or on the first date just to be open and honest to them and so they know like I promise I’m not ignoring or not listening plus it leads to a conversation to help with the nerves of first dates

I tend to leave some clues or hints at in my profile. I then tell them properly when arranging an actual date. That way usually we’ve chatted a bit so they got an idea of my personality, wether we’ll click, and wont be totally blindsided when I turn up and ask them to repeat something, use sign etc.

personally, ive had an online dating profile for a few months, only put it in my ‘about me’ section recently. already i have found someone who is also deaf, and i’ve been able to avoid people who are ableist or rude or don’t understand well. it doesn’t need to be your whole profile, but i have ‘partially deaf, please flirt loud and clear :)’ near the bottom of my ‘about me’

Tell them. Always.

i tried a dating app once and actually ghosted a guy who was hoh.

it wasn’t in either of our profiles, so he didn’t know i was deaf. and it wasn’t because he was hoh that i ghosted him, it was because of the way he told me. it gave me the ick because he was all like “i never get any girls because of this and nobody says yes because of it and i expect u to say no as well and blabla” and honestly, don’t do that. i would obviously not have cared and if he just asked for a date in a normal way i would’ve said yes.

I disclosed at the first face to face meeting. Communication is important in a relationship and if I cannot hear half the conversation, how is that going to go?! Now, are there people freaked out about it? Yes. But there are also people freaked out about their date carrying five extra pounds. So call it a litmus test or sorts. And you may be pleasantly surprised.

I agree with another comment. Skip the apps. Meet through activities and common interest clubs.

Yes put it on your dating profile.

For me I tell them before I meet them because I’m totally dead and use cochlear implants (bright blue) and even with cochlear implants it is difficult to understand speech in many “date type” environments.
I married a guy I met in college and he promised to learn ASL but didn’t and after almost 4 years being married he decided to cheat and texted me that he was filing for divorce. I got my first implant a year before he decided to cheat and I guess he didn’t really care to communicate. Now I tell people that I may seem to be hearing in a quiet situation but I ask them to be committed to learning ASL if they want a long term relationship because I’m still Deaf.
If I find a Deaf man who is single and well educated, I’d be happy but until that unicorn appears I’ll be asking hearing dudes to learn ASL.

In the same boat as you are.  I have a CI in my deaf ear, a HA in the other due to severe HOH.  I don't mention it in my profile.  When we have connected and are chatting, I do tell the person.  I say I can hear, though inadequately, with my devices.  I explain it means loud environments would not be a good date site, and that I need to see their face when they are talking to me to help me lip read.  No one has ghosted me because of that, as far as I know.  Ghosting is a general epidemic on dating sites, though.  lol

I am an ASL user who isn't interested in seriously dating yet another hearing person who doesn't sign so it's on my profile. Most of the time. Sometimes it just says I use ASL and not spoken English. (I can use spoken English kind of but give hearing people an inch and they take a mile.) There are other things about me I am often stuck disclosing on a dating profile and some stuff isn't public knowledge to the whole Deaf community, so it depends what I feel is more important to say.

Went on a date a few weeks ago and the guy told me almost three minuets in. He just asked me to walk on the side with his CI so that he could hear me better. I really appreciated knowing up front because I can speak very softly sometimes due to my own hearing difficulties, so it a good reminder for me to speak clearly. Always love when people give me clear info on how to best communicate with them.

I said it to my current boyfriend after the date. He thought I didn't like him, because I said what all the time. I didn't say it because I have experienced a lot of negative things and I was afraid he wouldn't like me anymore. If someone changes their mind or judge in general, because you are deaf..They are not worth your time! I would just say it right away.

I'm still figuring this one out. Curiosity question for some in my case I dont speak i can hear some with hearing aids but my voice simply put doesnt function (unrelated to hearing) when people do disclose do they often mention what their primary form of communication is ? IE speaking or signing ... and do you mention if you lipread, using hearing aids or other devices ? 

I'm curious because im figuring this out as well :)",2025-06-28 17:27:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lmsctg/dating_while_deaf_when_do_you_talk_about_it/
1lmks8g,deaf,recent diagnosis of mild neurosensorial deafness,"Good morning,

i am 28 years old. Recently I received diagnosis of mild neurosensorial bilateral deafness to the high frequencies. Honestly I am scared to loose my capacity of hearing in young ages. I can't tell if had it for ever or it's happened after several year of high music listening. Anyone bigger than me had a similar story? what happened to you? How did you accept the story? even it's not a cancer or something which threat your life, I think all the time to it. I am not sad about what I can't hear now (I think around me there are so many people more deaf than me without diagnosis), but about loosing completely my capacity to hear the world. I won't offend anyone who is in a situation worse than me, I know how lucky I am. Really. I know outside there are so many people in worse situation, just I would love knowing similar stories

[댓글]
I am sorry you are having bad time, I can relate I think.

I got assessed as having severe APD this week, I was suppose to be the hearing member of my deaf family and I was really upset. There is nothing wrong with being deaf or having hearing loss, my whole social life and family are those but I felt bad because it made me feel useless in how I could help support my family. 

Instead of me helping them because I can hear they speak for me because I have a severe stutter and they look after me as I am also autistic, not severe but they need to watch out for me as I am kinda gullible. 

You might be surprised and find the deaf community exciting, it’s my favorite place and all my best friends are either deaf or difficulty hearing. My mom’s deaf, my sisters are deaf, I went to deaf daycare, deaf elementary and deaf school now. Deaf people can and do anything anyone else can. When I am around them I honestly feel like the only disabled person which makes me kinda really sad.

You should look for your local deaf groups and stuff, you might make lots of new friends and do all kinds of great things. Also ASL is far better than speaking but I might be saying that because I can barely speak!! 

Good luck!!! 😁

&gt; Honestly I am scared to loose my capacity of hearing in young ages


Friend, you're not that young anymore. It's much less common for people your age to experience hearing loss, but certainly not impossible. 


You've only lost the high frequencies from what you've told us, so you'll start missing some consonant sounds, maybe. Be sure to take care of your ears going forward and you'll be fine. If it starts to affect your quality of life in any way explore getting hearing aids. The best time to get hearing aids is when you barely need them. 


So, my story. I was born with normal hearing, but lost all my hearing as a teen in the left side and lost almost all hearing on my right side in my 20s. I don't have any one else in my family like me. 


How do I accept? What choice do I have? I was born with weird cochleas.  You seem to contradict yourself a little. You say you're not sad about your situation but you don't know how to accept your plight? You say you don't want to offend but you imply that becoming deaf is a terrible burden. 


English may not be your first language so that may be why your post seems to lack some nuance.

I didn’t realize I had hearing loss until I met my wife 9 years ago. She pointed out how much I was missing. I got out of the military then Covid showed me how bad my hearing is. I started learning sign language right away. It took a couple years, but I finally got hearing aids. 

Life is pretty steady for me know. My wife and kids know exactly how I like to communicate in different environments. I know when my HAs can and can’t help me. My local Deaf community has been welcoming. 

The main point for me is that my hearing won’t deteriorate if I protect it. I know that’s not the case for a lot of people. There is a community here and you’re not alone.

It is great that you're reaching out and asking questions.  That can be empowering and assuring. Good for you.


Well, I  had cancer.  While it was scary at the time, I beat it.  Ten years later Covid came along and now I'm profoundly deaf in one ear and severely deaf in the other.  Hearing loss is a different journey.  I'm not going to beat it. I'm going to live a long life that requires adjustment and a different mindset. I use my fighting instincts to make sure I  do as much as possible to protect what hearing is left. Since I manage a call center, I  had to learn a lot fast to protect my job as well. I'm still learning how to tap into technologies and resources to maximize my capabilities.  I had to work through learning what was lost and learn to let go of the grief.  I had to learn to call myself deaf/HOH. Someone from this community gently told me to quit focusing on what I can't do any more and focus instead on what can be. It was the right advice at the right time.  Brilliant!


So, here's my 2 cent suggestion: Plan to live a vibrant life.  Don't let worry about what-if hold you back. The what-ifs in life rarely materialize.  Life is full of unexpected things.  You can't plan for everything.  You can build resources to help you deal with whatever comes your way. Talk with a financial planner to build economic security. Dream. And work to make your dreams happen.  Build and maintain your tribes: family, social groups, professional networks, the deaf and HOH community and, of course, your medical team.


I'm not going to say this last year was easy.  It wasn't.  The bottom line is that I'm so much more than my disability.  So are you. Wishing you all the best.

I had mild hearing loss in my 20s that progressed to moderate hearing loss in my 30s and have hearing aids now. I started learning my local sign language five years ago and am now conversational (not fluent though) - that has made the transition way easier as there are large parts of my week where I am not relying on listening to communicate, which is very tiring. I sometimes get irrationally anxious still when I can't hear things but am working on getting over that. Also hearing aids can be annoying, it is another thing I have to manage but overall I think I am doing fine with accepting it.

If you have been exposing yourself to loud sound (music, construction, etc) that mild high pitched only loss is usually due to that. The shape of you cochlea means that the hair cells that sense high sounds get damaged first by sound exposure, where damages from other sources don’t necessarily follow the pattern of high frequencies being affected first. Basically, the damage your are describing is consistent with the behaviour you report of listening to music too loudly… and while I can’t say for 100% sure that’s the case for you (I’m not your doctor, I’m not even a doctor, I don’t even have your records, and I’m not psychic) it’s a very, very reasonable guess that your mild high frequency hearing loss is from noise exposure.

In most cases the really simple way to prevent further hearing loss from noise exposure is just to limit the volume and use earplugs or other hearing protection when you’re in noisy situations. Noise induced hearing loss does not typically progress after exposure ceases.",2025-06-28 11:40:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lmks8g/recent_diagnosis_of_mild_neurosensorial_deafness/
1lme275,deaf,Anyone have more than 1 Caption phone?,"There are 3 HoH people in my home and we have 1 Caption phone. We would like another but when I called captel they said they could only provide 1 per address. Does anyone have more than 1 Caption phone in their home?

[댓글]
I haven't had a landline for years. Have you considered getting cellphones?  If you had a second captioned phone, wouldn't you also want a second line for it?  


You can use the CapTel app or what I prefer is InnoCaption. You can get a budget unlocked phone for around $200 or less and non-contact service will run you about $15 per month. (I'm happy with Mint Mobile, but T Mobile has good coverage where I live.) 


If you go this route I recommend getting a retro phone handset so you can easily see the captions and the other end of the call can hear you well. Though since I got my CI, I use Bluetooth and it works better than speakerphone mode with the phone speakers.

I experienced the same limit.  I put Nagash on my cell phone.  My calls are closed captioned. It is free and with me wherever I go.  I'm not sure if there are competive or better options but this works for me.  The cell phone speaks to my hearing aid and I get the support of captioning.  I'm still sort of new to this and playing with solutions.

My mother is beyond hearing aids and not very good with the cell phone. Too bad when the gal that put in our 1st caption phone said she would put one in my mother's room too at that time but my mother didn't know if she would like it or not. Thank you.",2025-06-28 04:29:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lme275/anyone_have_more_than_1_caption_phone/
1lm3m4r,deaf,Offering to interpret is rude?,"I am hearing. I recently started taking ASL classes, and we have been discussing etiquette in the Deaf and HoH space. Most of what we have discussed makes perfect sense to me, but there was one topic that surprised me: our teacher told us that we should NOT volunteer to interpret for strangers.

This was surprising for me to hear. I speak Japanese, and if I heard Japanese speakers struggling to communicate with an English speaker, I would feel comfortable letting them know that I speak Japanese and asking if they need any help. I have done this before, with both ""yes"" and ""no"" as the answer. I know that if I were struggling to communicate in Spanish, for example, I would very much appreciate someone offering to interpret for me.

Is this a common opinion in the Deaf community? If so, I would love to better understand the experience behind it. Are there too many times where people assume you need help when you don't, and it's annoying? Or do you already have so many tools for communicating with hearing people that interpretation in daily interactions is superfluous? This is just me brainstorming, so please correct me if I have the wrong idea.

EDIT:

Thanks for your responses, everyone. This was exactly the kind of perspective I was hoping to learn regarding this topic. I usually find that thinking of ASL as “just another language” that people use helps me treat it with respect, but it looks like it was hurting my perspective more than helping this time.

Just to clarify, since this came up in a few comments, I was not asking if I should offer to interpret for people. (I’ve literally had a single official ASL class at this point, and I doubt I’ll ever be able to have a “real” conversation in ASL.) My approach to unfamiliar cultures is “follow what they say, even if you don’t know why.” But now I know a little more of the “why,” so thanks! Hopefully this post will be helpful to others searching about this topic too.

There's this tendency toward ""rescuing"" behavior that hearing ASL learners seem to develop when they've got a little bit of knowledge under their belts, but unless you are fluent yourself, I've found that it only complicates to add **more** non-fluent signers to my conversation.

Imagine that I am attempting to communicate directly to a hearing non-signer.  I'm using gesture, pen and paper, whatever.  We're almost there.  Then a hearing learner steps in and insists, with their limited ASL skills, that they got this.  Now I have to backtrack and explain the context of the entire conversation to the hearing signer, who has to voice it to the person and then sign it back to *me*.  We retrace our footsteps.  The hearing signer struggles to recall exactly the right vocabulary to fit the situation.  They get nervous and start the arduous process of fingerspelling instead.  They misunderstand and voice something wrong and confuse the other person, who thought they were close to understanding me, but now wonders if they totally didn't get anything.  It's so many more steps, and in the end communication is even more muddled than it needs to be.

**Or**, everything goes smoothly.  The interaction proceeds with full understanding, but the hearing person gains no useful skills when it comes to communicating with a Deaf person.  They think, ""Oh thank god I didn't have to muddle through that by myself,"" and walk away from the interaction.  The next time they're faced with communicating with a Deaf person, they panic and look around for another savior to come around.

I’m an adult. I can order my own coffee and check into my hotel room. Unless you’re fluent, you’ll probably add to the confusion.

You can’t apply hearing culture rules to Deaf culture, like with the Japanese thing. Especially being hearing and new to sign. There’s just so much you don’t understand yet that you could cause serious misunderstandings and problems in relationships and communication beyond what you’re capable of interpreting right now. “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing” is a common saying for a reason, because when you’re new and excited about something, your motivation is high, but your competence is low you will start to understand as you study more. 

Hearing culture has knowingly and unknowingly, oppressed Deaf people since forever, and taken their agency and independence by having a paternalistic and infantilizing perspective on people who experience disabilities. Deaf people are fully able to navigate the world on their own. Don’t take away their agency by stepping in and thinking you have to help. Interpreting is not helping profession. We’re mostly there because not enough hearing people know sign language, not the other way around. 

The first question I always ask myself when interpreting is “Do I need to interpret this?”. If a DHH client is voicing for themselves, I wouldn’t voice over them. If direct communication is happening, I do not need to inject myself. Hearing hubris takes over sometimes and that can look like, “but I just wanted to help!”. Don’t ever feel so self important that you think you have to add yourself if they’re communicating without you. Direct communication is always best and if that is occurring on its own, no other person needs to step in and cause added complexity. When you think of doing this, just imagine having an adult stranger in a gynecologist appointment with you. Do not cause more suffering… FIRST DO NO HARM.

Also, if you’re not an interpreter, you have not technically promised to hold the tenants of our profession sacrosanct like confidentiality.

Deaf here; you’re assuming we’re helpless. It’s something we’ve lived and done our entire lives. 

Interpreting for someone on their travels in a foreign place is truly one time off/or few instances, which is completely different to “offering” Deaf person help that they’re used to navigating on our own. 

You say you’re just learning; chances are you’ll just add more confusion and ruin it more than being truly helpful.  It’s your savor angel coming to help mindset and I truly encourage you not to have that mindset; we don’t care for those folks. 

Hearing folks often way over estimate their ASL skills. Always have.  Very rare I’ve met completely fluent hearing user unless they’ve been signing for years. And I mean years. Or CODA/SOPA etc themselves. 

I don’t even let my minor kids interpret for me even though they’re near native because it sets a precedent with hearing folks they’ll expect my kids to step in. Nope. They need to do the work interacting with me.

Most people who ""know"" ASL are not anywhere near the level of skill that they need to be to interpret effectively. Those miscommunications can be extremely frustrating or even dangerous for Deaf people. Also there is a little bit of a hearing savior complex where they want to rescue us as if we are not extremely accustomed to interacting with and navigating the hearing world and communication barriers (for example those speaking Japanese are probably from a different country and are in a foreign experience, I am at this grocery store every week). Also interpreting is more than just knowing ASL. It's being able to communicate tone and context and to have a deep knowledge and respect for the Deaf community and our culture and values. Trained interpreters also have ethical rules and confidentiality rules that a random stranger doesn't.  All too often people who volunteer to interpret are unqualified and untrained for that nuance and make the interaction more about them than the Deaf person. There are only a few hearing family members and close friends I trust to interpret for me. I'd be happy to chat with a stranger learning ASL but I shut down any interpreting very quickly.

I’m hearing, dated a Deaf guy for almost 4 years and became nearly fluent in ASL. 

Signing and *interpreting* are **very** different. I volunteered once and only because I happened to be at the gym and a Deaf person was looking to sign up and I could tell there were frustrations (you could just tell she was visibly frustrated because the guy wasn’t doing his best to accommodate) signing up and then I was like “well shit how he going to give her a tour of the gym if she wants it” so I offered to assist but was up front that I’m not by any means a highly experienced interpreter but am highly fluent. She accepted, walked with her and the guy to give her a tour of the gym, the rooms, exercise stuff, etc. She gave me a hug after which I was not expecting but was happy to help and still see her from time to time and we catch up. 

But know that Deaf people don’t need hearing people to save them. When I was at several of the BLM rallies I was interpreting for my boyfriend at the time because after 3 years of dating we knew of each others signing/understanding abilities to get by.  As I was interpreting my best for him, one of the organizers asked if I would come up on the stage and interpret for the entire speech which I respectfully declined. I’m comfortable signing for my boyfriend because if I sign something wrong he can correct it; however, me up there by myself the last thing I would want is to fuck up royally and make a mockery. Furthermore, expressive signing is easy because you know what you are saying and trying to convey; however, receptive understanding of sign language can be very challenging if you don’t understand the grammar and signing syntax used, especially if they are very quick with their signing. 

Recently taking ASL classes, you’re just scratching the surface of signing, morphemes, signing space, etc.; but not really interpreting and grammar. It’s human nature to want to help people, irrespective of what’s going on; however, volunteering when you’re just starting I would think is a nice gesture but can across as diminishing the abilities of a Deaf person. My ex made it 29 years of his life being Deaf, his family knows zero sign language (they are all hearing and don’t even get me started as to that bullshit) and he is a fully functioning adult. If we went out to the bar, he can order for us while I grab a seat.

You just started taking classes. If you were fluent, id feel differently, but ppl who just started suffer from dunning krueger effect. People offer to interpret and know just enough sign to convey things unclearly or incorrectly and to add confusion to the situation.

As a CODA who grew up with an all deaf family. Yes. If you budge in and offer to interpret especially for a stranger, it is considered rude. It is crucial that are at the certain stages of fluency where you can comprehend the language entirely to understand the context. I don’t even interpret for my family, because they are well and capable of finding a fix in communication barriers, number one. Number 2– people also need to learn how to communicate/offer solutions to barriers when it comes to interacting with deaf people. Most deaf people are very capable of setting boundaries, standing their ground, even when it is difficult they will push through to be understood and heard.

Unless it is something more serious or needs clear communication, I will interpret and will do so, mostly when it is requested from my family. But there are times where I’ve had to step in because the other side of communication from the hearing person is like non existent and they have no clue what to do with deaf people.

Just another perspective: I am hearing and not at all very good with SL but would like to practise in authentic situation with Deaf people. Last week, after SL Mass we (hearing and Deaf) went out to grab a bite. I was seated with three other Deaf, and soon, two just started to tell me what they would like to order, assuming I would be ordering for them. 

I live in East Asia where the Deaf culture is different. But I want to share my experience in order to add another perspective.

I am hearing and have been signing for 10 years. There is no way I would interpret for a Deaf person. Outside of the cultural implications (which I will leave for the Deaf people in this group to speak on), being able to converse in the language is VERY different from being able to interpret the language. There is a reason the word interpreting is used in ASL, instead of translating; one sign can have many different meanings. It is all about context and a beginner signer would not be able to quickly understand the context and use the appropriate meaning in conversation.

Don’t do this, my mom hates it and it really affects her thinking and planning. My sisters get annoyed too. My mom wouldn’t ever let me interpret and this was before she knew I APD and a severe stutter so couldn’t anyway.

Hi, not Deaf technically but hard of hearing with a decent amount of involvement with my local Deaf community and I have a few thoughts on this. For instance, you say you are just starting out with ASL so first off you are not qualified to be an interpreter. Even if you become more fluent, interpreting is a skill that most have to become qualified to do and can lead to misunderstandings and even legal concerns. I think there is also the assumption that the Deaf person knows sign language to begin with. When I worked at a library there was a regular who was deaf and didn’t know ASL and she would get so frustrated by my coworkers who didn’t ask how to communicate with her or how to properly communicate with D/d/HH folks which I helped to fix. Her preferred way of communicating was writing things down and then lip reading what the person was saying. So if you are going to offer help, ask how they prefer to communicate. Give them your realistic level of ASL and ask if they want help. I also study Japanese and there is a huge difference in Deaf and Japanese culture which might explain your experience.  But anyway, outside of minor cases, you really should leave interpreting to professionals which (for now) should be legally provided and in the rare case you are in a situation where someone might need help, simply treat them like you would anyone. “Hi my name is ____ and I know basic ASL. I saw the confusing scenario over here and wanted to ask if I can help. Do you have a preference in communication?” Something like that. Please everyone correct me if I’m wrong and I’m sure everyone has their own unique view of this. I am only answering based on my own experiences and feelings.

I appreciate the thought, but I communicate completely fine in writing if someone doesn't know ASL. I have had friends offer to interpret for me which I accepted then found out that they accidentally misinterpreted what I was saying. I can't trust that a random stranger is competent enough in ASL to effectively interpret exactly what I say and not accidentally misconstrue my words. Especially because sometimes ASL students get very excited with the chance to use their skills and want to jump right in to interpret even though they're not proficient enough. I have more peace of mind if I communicate for myself unless I am dealing with a licensed interpreter that was hired for me.

I've been a lurker in this sub for a bit, I am hearing and I just want to add my two cents based on what I've learned over the years: grown ass adults don't need saving. If you, someone who knows a little bit of ASL, happened to not be there, notice them, or insert yourself, they would figure it in the way they think is best, just as they have for their entire life. I think its quite condescending. 

  
So I would say yeah, don't do it. However I have learned that lots of d/Deaf people are fine to like talk and chat if you know sign, they are people after all. (But again they are people, not objects for us to use as practice) Just don't belittle them, they don't need our help.

Yeah, I’m Deaf but I have quite a bit of residual hearing. I grew up oral and while I am now fluent in ASL, I am not a native signer. But hearing ppl will sometimes ask me to interpret between them and other Deaf ppl. It’s annoying at times. On my part, it feels like they forget that I’m Deaf too even if I appear to communicate well. 

I do pass on important information I happen to hear in the environment. For example, I have let Deaf ppl I don’t know at airports know about a gate change that was just announced.

As a new, hearing, learner there is a show called Switched at Birth. I learned a LOT of do’s and don’ts from this show. Yes, I know it is fiction, but this show taught me so much about the deaf community, that I now want to immerse myself in it.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

The other day I was in a gas station and the worker was yelling in frustrated English and the customer in front of me was explaining in Spanish his issue. I speak fluent English and Spanish but could see that he wanted to communicate directly and make her understand (she kept declining his card because she wasn't entering it properly). The guy behind me started yelling in elementary Spanish to him to ""help"" but he was shouting ""card no bueno!"" He thought the customer didn't understand that his card was declined but actually he was asking the cashier to run it as credit, not EBT (food stamps). Because I speak Spanish fluently I knew he was explaining that he already understood it was declined and was telling the cashier to run it as a credit card. The ""helper"" didn't correctly identify the misunderstanding and further frustrated the customer (as well as insulting his intelligence thinking he didn't understand the card was declined).
I'm also a fluent signer and this happens when I'm out with a Deaf friend. I never ever ever intervene to smooth it out. She herself already knows which part the person doesn't understand and she will work to make them understand. She doesn't know English well and she can still perfectly communicate, coming from a different country, profoundly deaf. If I jumped in it would be embarrassing. She has asked me a word once but it was ""rewards program"". She understood the written word as ""award"" and asked me what it was

It is depends on your levels of skills in signing same way as you speak Japanese.  I'm grateful you want to help, I'd sugget you to approach lightly and let them know I'm not perfect signing but I can try help you if you need me to help.

As a person with a speech impediment, I dislike it when people talk for me.

Let me tell you, navigating the hearing world is no box of chocolates, hearing people are often jackasses …and so we get pretty hardened… prickly… and even bitchy about certain things. This is one of them. The first correspondent on this thread laid it out fairly perfectly, but some deaf people are just looking for a chance to be offended and a naïve hearing “helper” is a great opportunity to be a bitch. You had a great question I’m glad you asked it. But just be chill until you have experienced more.

1llt0j3,deaf,Has anyone been told that they are not a suitable candidate for a cochlear implant?,"My wife has just been for an assessment and has been told she may not be a suitable candidate for the implant. She is 36 years old and lost hear hearing at 3 years old due to meningitis. 

[댓글]
I was originally going to be implanted on my right side, but they first needed to test to see if the auditory nerve on that side still worked, because I'd lost the hearing in that ear many years before. If the nerve has deteriorated, the implant won't do any good.

(Then the hearing in my left went away faster than expected and I ended up with a left side implant instead)

Yes.  I had a consultation with the surgeon and he recommended that I shouldn’t get it because I use what little hearing I have very well and he couldn’t guarantee it would provide any more benefit than my current hearing aid, and getting a CI could destroy what hearing I have permanently.

I lost my hearing completely from a meningococcal Infection in my brain and spine as an adult (Jan 23) took both sides, my facial muscles, balance etc.

They told me, not that I may not be suitable but that there is no guarantee that a CI will work as they can not ascertain exactly where the damage is but after 2 years of repeated assessments, I finally chose the Med-El sonnet 3 this week. WIll it be successful? We shall see!

I lost my hearing at 6 months due to meningitis and had the implant when I was 1. It’s common for older deaf patients to reject their implant when they get it when they’re adults cause they can’t cope with sounds they never heard of before and they stop trying the implant altogether, that’s my guess

You’d have to go through more assessments to get official answers, but there are a variety of reasons someone might not be a candidate. 

A big reason is ossification of the cochlea. If you can’t pass the electrodes through, then you can’t, y’know? That’s why CI users often hear high pitches better—the electrode arrays couldn’t get all the way through so they’re not triggering the nerves associated with lower frequencies as well. 

Another reason is auditory nerve issues. Sometimes they might be missing or damaged, and you cannot recover nervous tissue. 

Generally CI surgeons are willing to implant pretty much anyone if they get even marginal benefit, though. Eg, access to environmental sounds like car noises can be important if you live in a city as a matter of safety. Make sure your wife has the tools (preferred communication, information ready to go, etc.) to advocate for what she wants at the next meeting.

It’s believed that the longer your cochlea went without hearing, the harder it will be to relearn what you don’t know after activation.  A lot of the rehab I did after being activated was remembering what things sounded like and really focusing on that sound to get my brain to understand that the electrical stimulus was that sound.  Also, sometimes the meningitis kills off so many hair cells that nothing will help to revive hearing in that ear.

Did she lose hearing on both sides?  If so she may not be a candidate. Plus, the fact that she may not have used her ears for 33 years will mean she'll have a harder time making sense of whatever a CI could give her. 

There are auditory brainstem implants that people can get, if she's not a candidate for a CI, but those don't provide as much resolution as a CI can. What's driving her desire for a CI anyway? Whatever she wants to do is a valid choice but she's been deaf most of her life. I'm curious why she's pursuing this now.

Yes.

Yes. I got nauseated when they did water in my ear; i don’t think they still do anything like this, but the vertigo testing is not one for me, therefor I’d be a risk. 
I cannot stand vertigo, so I’m happy to avoid, if worsening is even possible!

It does make sense, meningitis adds a lot of issues that doesn’t typically happen.  This is also why doctors prefer to implant as soon as possible often as infants ie auditory nerve degradation, brain mapping, cochlea ossification. 

If she wants some kind of sound simulation there is a experimental brain stem implant, but on a less invasive scale the tactile band from neurosensory does give some audible feedback in the form of tactile vibrations.

It is frustrating to hear that door is closed, she may want to inquire why she is not a candidate ie her auditory nerve was tested and is atrophied or her cochlea is ossified, some doctors do implant outside the cochlea if the auditory nerve is functional.

I have NF2 and I'm not candidate. I can't recall why but I think it has something to do with me having Gammaknife treatments in the past.

Non of my family who are completely deaf are candidates. I don’t know why but they are all the way deaf. Doesn’t bother them. There was a boy in my school, he got told he wasn’t suitable and became super toxic and is now homeschooled. I felt bad.

Look into ABI i canyon have a ci. Abi connect right into the brainstem.

I was told that it would only give me 10% of the implant. That wasn't enough for me I'm disappointed at the doctor telling me I wouldn't be a good candidate",2025-06-27 12:47:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1llt0j3/has_anyone_been_told_that_they_are_not_a_suitable/
1llj3qp,deaf,Workplace Discrimination,"Hey y’all! This is just a rant. I quit the job today, so there is no need to worry about how I approach/handle the situation:) 

Around 6 weeks ago, I (22F) attended an interview to be a server at a locally-owned restaurant. I never disclose my deafness in interviews, so I didn’t mention I was Deaf and wear CIs. I was hired as a host (because I have no previous restaurant experience) and was told that I could train to be a server after working as a host for a couple of weeks.

When I started the job, I told my coworkers and my managers that I’m Deaf with CIs. I did a great job hosting and was commended by many. After a few weeks, I asked a manager (let’s call him Daniel) if I could start training to be a server. Daniel told me that two girls who have been hosts for a few years were going to be trained first bc of seniority (they just graduated high school and wanted to be a server in college). He said I would be trained after and that it wouldn’t be long. I told him that I totally understood and continued to do my job well. 

Since then, I have not done poorly at my job at all or faced any kind of trouble. However, two weeks ago, the work environment started to become hostile. One coworker called me a “deaf motherfucker” and told me I needed to “listen better.” Two of my managers (Daniel and another one) and other coworkers started to stop repeating themselves to me and looked annoyed when I asked them to. I started to notice more and more that Daniel didn’t try to give me the time of day or even say more than two words to me the entire night (even though he talked to all of my other coworkers).

This week, I noticed that I was scheduled for running food and bussing tables for the first time. I shrugged it off because servers/hosts *occasionally* do run bus, like 1-2 times every two weeks. 

Yesterday, I asked another manager about when I could be trained to be a server. He said that “it would take a while” and nothing more specific than that.

Today, schedules for next week were released. I counted that I was scheduled to do *seven* run/bus shifts over two weeks while the other hosts and servers weren’t being scheduled at ALL. 

I then saw that a girl who got here 1 1/2 WEEKS AGO (who works as a host with me and told me that the management also told her to work as a host before being a server) was scheduled for a server training shift. 

I put all of these pieces together and realized that my restaurant management was putting me at the back of the house because I am Deaf. I am so incredibly upset, angry, and horrified.

TLDR: the restaurant where I worked made me work back of the house due to my Deafness (even though I was hired as a hostess).

I was a waiter before became deaf and quit after cause it’s doable but extremely exhausting.

You did a good thing. You should have quit as soon as they insulted you that was so mean, I am sorry that happened. 😭😭😭

Is there a deaf or ASL community near you maybe even some disability groups? They might help you find a job, they do where I live. 

I hope you can find a job that will be kinder and more patient!!! Stuff like this makes me scared for when I have to get jobs when I am older.

You’re brave. I also wear a CI but I could never be a server. I think you need to have a sit down meeting with your manager and to go HR or the board to report discrimination. Otherwise, maybe look somewhere else.

If you don’t report it then it will happen to someone else. Don’t let it go.

That sucks. I’ve been asked multiple times at work “ArEnT yOu GoInG tO aNsWeR tHe PhOnE?”. No Karen. Im not. Because I can’t use a phone. And you can clearly see my hearing aids.",2025-06-27 02:51:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1llj3qp/workplace_discrimination/
1llemj8,deaf,"How do I stop comparing myself to hearing people, and to be confident in my deafness?","I typed out two massive paragraphs and then deleted them so I'll try to summarise. I've been deaf for pretty much my entire time in education, the only deaf person in my year group in the schools I attended, and I got worse grades than everyone else consistently. Part of me blames how I couldn't understand a lot due to hearing difficulties, and another part of me blames how eventually I just stopped trying as much as I should have in school because I gathered that I would just end up misunderstanding and mishearing everything anyway, so what was even the point? Whenever I would excitedly tell something I just found out to my friends when we were like 12, I would be met with scoffs and a rather passive aggressive ""Did you seriously not know about that until just now? Literally everyone's known for months. Jesus, OP,"" and my enthusiasm would be out like a light. 

The feelings I got when I was told that carried over into the next six years of my life until I graduated, with below average grades compared to my peers, and I still felt, and still feel, awful for not ""knowing anything"". 3 years later my younger (hearing) sister just graduated: her grades come out in a few months, and while I am super proud of her, a little part of me feels resentful and maybe even envious that she's predicted to get much more impressive grades than I ever did. 

I know, fundamentally, we're different people, and one of us has a profound hearing loss that the other never had to deal with in all her life. Our lives are different, and that's not a bad thing.  Whenever I privately tell my parents how I feel, they tell me that I had to face so many more challenges that other people my age never even had to think about, so I shouldn't be too hard on myself. I know there's grounds to this claim but I know of many, many successful deaf and/or disabled people who did well in school, and it's hard not to feel like maybe something's wrong with me personally.

Is there a way around feeling like this? I asked here because I'm not sure if people in other subs will really understand how I feel, and I'm posting this as a shot in the dark that maybe someone else can advise me on how to get out of this mindset.

I did very well in school.

Why?
I had a sign language interpreter.

I’m getting the feeling you haven’t been given the accommodations you need this whole time. 

You aren’t stupid, your education was sabotaged by lack of access. I’m sure your parents meant well and they love you but I don’t believe they gave you what you needed to succeed in life. 

You didn’t fail, the system failed you.

Usually, it’s not the ”the only deaf person in my year group in the schools I attended” who do well in school, but those who do have Deaf role models, get things explained in sign language or other accessible ways and have good support in school.

Yes, you probably could have tried harder, but who taught you how to do such a thing? Who noticed and talked to you about the social incidents you mentioned, and helped you process them so that you didn’t have to feel bad about it? You were a child and had the right to get much better support in school than what you had. If you wasted your cognitive capacity trying to listen and trying to communicate, you experienced listening fatigue and didn’t really have much spare capacity to use for the actual studying. Unfortunately, hearing adults very often don’t see or understand all these processes. And yourself, you didn’t really have a way to compare exactly how hard or easy things would be with normal hearing. 


It’s very common that Deaf students have lower grades than their hearing peers, and all of these can’t be lazy or stupid. You can do anything a hearing person can, except hearing, but you will always be at a disadvantage if you do things on hearing terms. It’s perfectly ok to find ways to do things, or to communicate, that work for you. If the hearing way is less efficient and doesn’t work well, and have a better way, then advocate for that. Try to meet as many different Deaf and HoH people to see how other solve things. Find role models, and look for those who seem to have good lives that you would enjoy. And reflect on how work towards things that are meaningful and interesting to you personally. 

You can’t change the past, but you can definitely influence things in the future. Don’t spend time on things that drain your energy, and do spend time on things that feels positive and provide meaning and energy. Things that take you closer towards any goals you have. Do take time to reflect and adjust goals, so that they feel relevant to you. These things can change over a lofe time. Of you don’t know to do something that would take you closer towards any a goal, then find out. Learn more, get feedback from those who seem trustworthy, plan, take small steps over time to move your live in a good direction. You might never reach some of the goals, but knowing you’re putting your energy on something meaningful, will feel rewarding even when it might be hard work some times. And all the experience you get, will provide more understanding that in turn will enable you to clarify and adapt your goals over time. You can still do a huge amount of things in life, so don’t stop dreaming.

I go to deaf school and everyone’s different. I don’t think we need to compete. Like of course completely deaf people like my sisters all exist within the same place but I think even they have different experiences from each other.

I think also all hearing people are different. I am hearing and my family who are all deaf where relieved and thought oh he will get to do things without the problems we have but then booooom I have APD and can’t understand what people say, and then I also have a severe stutter so can’t speak well.

I was assessed yesterday and was upset because I don’t know who I am or what I am and I feel like I can do nothing for my family. I am hearing but my mom had to speak for me yesterday because someone was talking to me and I couldn’t understand. 

My grades in school are also not good, I just have a hard time but luckily I am first language ASL so I can live within the deaf community and be happy. But I feel upset that I can’t go outside of it confidently.

My mom had a bad accident when pregnant and I was lucky to be born at all so I guess anything positive or anything I do since is a good thing. 

I think you need some more deaf friend? Like a club or something and so you can see how cool, strong and amazing deaf people can be, just as good or if not stronger than hearing people. My mom’s amazing and has a great job, my sisters all work so hard and have big goals. All my friends and family that I have are deaf and they are the ones supporting and looking after me. 

I’ll be happy if I can get any job when I am older it’s okay 😊

Sorry if my comment is bad I kinda just talk a lot 😂😂

It’s generally a losing proposition with an inaccurate conclusion to compare how we feel on the inside to how everyone else appears in life from the outside.

If you want good grades, go take a class and get good grades. Do the things you need to in order to do that like making sure you have what you need to succeed and then not giving up. Do things that feel esteemable to you. Just make sure you have a goal and it’s specific, achievable, and measurable before you start that way you aren’t just always moving the goalposts on yourself before you can get the chance to feel some of that success.

I’m profoundly deaf and don’t label myself as anything or compare myself with others. I just “am”. 
 There will always be “lesser” and “greater” people than oneself in various ways, personality, looks, wealth, etc. 

You could also ask - what would you say to a plain Jane who compares herself with a supermodel / Hollywood actress. It’s a similar thing.",2025-06-26 23:12:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1llemj8/how_do_i_stop_comparing_myself_to_hearing_people/
1ll7eeo,deaf,Brainstorming help for using cochlear implants and MS Teams,"I am posting on behalf of a friend who is part of the Deaf community, seeking advice on troubleshooting their current situation. Sort of a long post to include troubleshooting attempts and context. 

Long story short, they rely on Bluetooth streaming (to their cochlear implant) and captioning (via InnoCaption) as an ADA accommodation. Ever since their company switched phone systems to Microsoft Teams, they've faced daily issues just trying to make or receive phone calls.

  
Microsoft TEAMS has made it impossible for them to have a phone set up to do all of the following simultaneously:   
\- Stream audio via Bluetooth to their cochlear implant (Kanso 2, which is compatible with Apple devices)  
\- Caption all calls using a certified IP CTS relay service like InnoCaption  
\- Accept incoming hotline calls routed through Teams call queues/groups  
\- Use the company's number as the caller ID (for outgoing calls)

  
Previous troubleshooting attempts/methods used:  
ICU: They were assigned a work iPhone with a direct number in the company's system. They forwarded incoming calls to InnoCaption, and the iPhone streamed audio to their cochlear implant via Bluetooth  
  
Current job: (Pre-TEAMS) - Again, they *had* a dedicated iPhone that streamed audio via Bluetooth. They forwarded calls through Mitel to InnoCaption. They could also accept hotline calls because the system rang out to a group of phone extensions  
  
Why MS Teams doesn’t work:   
\- Teams captioning is the worst I’ve ever seen, it’s inaccurate, delayed, only shows \~6 words at a time, and requires you to manually enable CC for all incoming calls  
\- can’t accept Group calls anymore because Teams doesn’t assign a unique number when routing calls through Groups, so forwarding doesn’t work  
\- Outgoing calls don’t go through InnoCaption, and I can’t use the InnoCaption app directly because the calls need to appear as if they’re coming from the company's number



[댓글]
\&gt; Ever since their company switched phone systems to Microsoft Teams,

Yeah those cloud based PBX services are a bitch.  You and your friend should contact InnoCaption directly, they also have a Reddit pressence  u/Innocaption  
[https://www.innocaption.com/workplace-solutions](https://www.innocaption.com/workplace-solutions)

Edit to add:  Does your friend have Windows 11 24H2 (or later)?  Have they tried using Teams as a soft phone and the live caption app included with Windows?  It's still ASR but it's not too bad, most of the time. Instead of bluetooth, they'll need to do audio from the computer with the mini mic (I'm also a Cochlear user but I prefer the Nucleus 8 over the Kanso 2)

Teams closed captioning works great for me.

Have alternatives to Teams been explored?

There is a wireless phone clip that streams the audio from the smartphone (or other Bluetooth devices) to the cochlear implant

I generally find the Teams captions to be relatively decent IF the sound quality is good...meaning everybody is in their own office using their own microphone. If people are around a conference table? No. (Also, you used to have to turn it on every time, which was annoying, but I think that changed a couple years ago; it's always on for me now)

Anyway:

For a Teams call, I will join twice. The sound goes through my iphone to my implant. (If I wanted to, I could also enable Apple's live captions for it). The video goes through my computer. I'm guessing I could also use Teams for the web to watch the video in Chrome and use Google's captions.

Hi there! We would love to get more information and see if there's anything we can do on our end to make things better for your friend. Please email us at [support@innocaption.com](mailto:support@innocaption.com) when you have a chance, we've shared your message with our support team and they look forward to connecting with you!

I also use Microsoft Teams but it's not for the phone system. The live captioning turns on by default for me. You may want to also check out r/MicrosoftTeams

Like someone else mentioned, Cochlear Americas has a bluetooth phone clip for streaming from a computer (or the mini mic is supposed to work for streaming as well) so that might be an option for your friend - the phone clip works well for me though I don’t think the microphone part works as well, so I have another headset with attached microphone. Sometimes I’ll just use the headset without the phone clip since I can hear pretty well with the headset. 

Personally, I find the auto captions on TEAMS to work pretty well for me and there’s an option to keep it permanently on in the settings. Is your friend in a noisy environment or talking to people who are in noisy environments frequently? If so, that might be messing with the auto captions. Has your friend tried installing the Teams app on their iPhone for calls with the Bluetooth streaming? The app should have the auto captions but your friend could also try using the Iphone live caption feature (in the iPhone accessibility settings) and see if that would work better. Or does she need someone actually doing the transcription? I *think * there’s a setting in teams for a TTY service - no idea how that works but maybe that’s something she could look into.

I use MS Teams at work &amp; after a recent upgrade I can now have captions on all the time by default.

I use MS Teams at work also, in addition to Zoom.  I do not use the MS Teams app - I go to [teams.microsoft.com](http://teams.microsoft.com) on Google Chrome.  From there, I turn on the live captions in the Google Chrome settings.  The captions there are AI powered and 99% efficient with no delay.  With Zoom, I use the link in the invitation via Google Canary due to Zoom using different audio drivers then Teams. I also use the live captions there.  I maximize the captioning box.  I also find it very helpful to use OneNote so I can capture what is being said, if the meeting isn't being recorded.   I am deaf and wear a cochlear implant.  With these tools, I'm able to easily partake in meetings, even with people with foreign accents that hearing people struggle with.",2025-06-26 18:15:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ll7eeo/brainstorming_help_for_using_cochlear_implants/
1ll4tfc,deaf,Nurse thought cleaning ears would cure me,"Today I took a trip to the doctors for a routine check up. I wore my CI because I don’t feel like having a terp at a 30 minute appt.

I laughed and told her I’m Deaf and she said she knows but thought with my CI I can hear. I said kind of yes but not though my ears. How nurses don’t know how CI works? I thought this was so funny. Anyway now have clean ears but still don’t work 🤣.

I told a doctor that Im deaf she said oh you are hard of hearing. I'm like girl really? Won't be seeing her again. I should have known better when I told them reception that I may need help and they legit had this lady yelling my name and of course I didnt answer. I told her that Im deaf. She proceeds to talk to me not facing me like Im supposed to get all of that.

Nurses are some of the most clueless folks who work in medical settings. I've met some who are phenomenal and really in-the-know, but lots who make you question why they work in the medical field.

Saw an Audiologist the other day for a routine test on my left ear (profound loss) and I use a CI on my right side. I’ve used this clinic for a few years but wasn’t my usual Audiologist that day. She had many questions about my CI which I was happy to answer but was surprised when she said she had never seen one before. I guess they aren’t as common as I thought.

Happened to me yesterday literally after being assessed for APD, my mom had to stop at her pharmacy to pick something up and she’s deaf and she sees the pharmacist trying to speak to me and she was like “he doesn’t understand you he has APD” and she then proceeded to shout at me loudly. My mom said to me in the car “welcome to the club” and I was like “but I always had APD I just read lips before” and she said “true but now I know you don’t understand and ain’t just being rude” 😂😂

When my daughter was a baby she kept getting ear infections, I kept telling the pediatrician that I think she is deaf. He insisted it was just fluid in her ears and give her Dimetapp. I persisted and He finally sent me to an audiologist. She was diagnosed as profoundly deaf at 1 year.

It's really amazing how many people don't know how CIs work. To the point that they think its a cure for deafness lmao. 🙄😅

I'm deaf in right ear.  I recently had medical issue on that side, and the receptionist or person setting my appointment said I needed hearing test.  I had to tell him I'm deaf on that side.... like they expect it's going to make me hear better??  Issue was on the outside of the ear.

So back when I first started to really lose my hearing (I had a mild loss as a kid that started progressing when I was around 19), I went out and bought an ear cleaning kit because I thought maybe my ears just needed cleaning. No luck! 

But I have to laugh at the fact that she thought it would fix your deafness, especially when you have a CI. Uhhh ma’am, my ears are just for decoration! 😂

you seem to be working just fine (adjust grammar to get the joke you were going after, tee hee)

I am always amazed at the lack of deaf awareness among ""health professionals""

Ive been yelled at in the VA audiology clinic ffs.

Yeah, I’ve had to explain to almost every nurse what my daughter’s CIs are and inform them she is deaf (despite it being at the top of her chart). It’s generally fine, but gives me pause for the rest of her care.

Being deaf is very low incidence compared to-- say being blind or in a wheelchair-- so unfortunately many healthcare professionals when they encounter us they are only slightly less clueless compared to their first day of school. Add on a device and most of them are even more clueless.

Being deaf or not it's important to clean your ears every other month or so I couldn't imagine going years without cleaning out my ears it gets really bad after a few months not only is it good hygiene I would bet some medical issues could arise from never cleaning your ears out eventually

Same! I was told I had to get my ears totally cleared out of wax before I could get my hearing aids “calibrated” and put onto the right setting for me, so it was accurate. When I went to the nurse, she asked why I was getting an ear wax removal, I told her it so I could get my hearing aids put on the right setting, she legit said “you probably won’t need hearing aids anymore after I’ve done this”. I was diagnosed with a moderate hearing impairment at 4.",2025-06-26 16:36:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ll4tfc/nurse_thought_cleaning_ears_would_cure_me/
1lktbar,deaf,"How does nerve sensitivity work, and can amplified sounds damage less sensitive/other-focused nerves?","(This is a repost; my first post, a month ago, received no comments)
Hello,

The way i understand it is, we have a long row of nerves, each one has a kind of curve of sensitivity to different frequencies, and each has a peak sensitivity to a particular frequency, which ill call its focus. 
Is that correct so far?
Well, in cases of sensorineural hearing loss, i understand that some of these nerves are dead, and the surrounding nerves can pick up the frequencies it focused, but at a lower volume (as they are less sensitive to these frequencies)
Is that correct?
Therefore, i ask,
Lets say i had an -90dB HL at 8khz. That means that, for my ear to pick up 8khz sounds, i need 80db amplification, because the hairs that focused on 8khz are dead and the nearest ones are 'quite far away' in terms of focus frequency.
Is that correct?
Now, obviously 90dB of amplification + whatever addtional volume is played on top of that, would cause deafness in a normal hearing person. But how about me? If a sound is played exclusively at 8khz, with a 90dB amplification and addtional volume, would the less sensitive nerves be damaged by this sound?

Thank you very much, and sorry for the abruptness. I just want a straight answer and ive struggled to find one haha.

This may seem rude but it deserves to be said.  The reason you got no comments last time is because your questions are stupid and it's foolish to ask here on Reddit. 

It's impossible to answer your questions because every individual is different. Every person is susceptible to damage from noise exposure to a different extent.  Plus just because you can't hear a specific tone until a certain decibel level doesn't mean that it's not causing damage.

I don't have the answer, but have you tried posting this in other communities? Such as Ssl or hearing?",2025-06-26 06:48:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lktbar/how_does_nerve_sensitivity_work_and_can_amplified/

1lklbzf,deaf,Identity Crisis When Wearing Hearing Aids?,"I should probably just do therapy instead, but I’m back on Reddit asking strangers for reassurance 😅

Does anyone struggle with Deaf identity when they wear their hearing aids or CI? 

I am 100 percent deaf in my right ear since birth, and rapidly have lost most of my hearing in my left ear since September 2024. Right ear is profound and left is in the mostly severe range (see below)- right ear not tested anymore due to permanent profound loss. 

Without my hearing aids, I predominantly rely on ASL and lip reading to communicate. But with them, I can get by decent in conversation (people still need to face me, but in relatively chill environments I can keep up). My issue is that whenever i use my hearing aids, because I keep up so much better than without them, I start to doubt my Deaf identity. Without my hearing aids, hard of hearing doesn’t feel like it matches my experience (I identified as HOH before and my experience now is completely different). 

My questions are these:

1. Does anyone else struggle with this when wearing assistive devices? 
2. Does anyone else with similar loss also identify as Deaf, not hard of hearing?

I guess I’m hoping for a little affirmation in the identity department as I’m still getting used to the change and others perceptions about me saying I’m Deaf, but still communicating orally with those who don’t sign. 
Thanks for reading!

I'm Deaf, wear a CI and I still consider myself Deaf. with or without assisted devices, it's still who I am and always will be.

I've got moderate/severe hearing loss in both ears.  I've never struggled with my identity as a HOH person because it's who I am.  Yeah, I can pass for a hearing person with my hearing aids in &amp; all that, but the hearing aids don't negate the fact that my ears don't work like other people's do.  I think you're overthinking this juuuuust a tad, lol.

  
I won't answer the second question because I've covered it elsewhere, but suffice it to say that I was horribly rejected from both hearing &amp; Deaf worlds as a child &amp; my identity is HOH because of the treatment I received.  Neither world has more of a pull on me than the other, so I tell people I walk that line, weaving expertly between the two.  It's lonely &amp; a bit isolating, but it's the path I had to take.  I know no other way of living.

Hey, you stole my audio gram! Seriously very very similar curves and values. 

 I’m late deafened (started 4.5 years ago, rapid progression, still getting deafer) and consider myself deaf because I prefer visual communication. The hearing I have is not functional without a ton of work and cognitive overload and I prefer the quiet and being visually aware. 

I didn’t for a while, but last November realized I only wear my HAs for other people. Today I’m learning ASL, getting involved with my Deaf community and use call captioning etc as processing sound is so hard for me I can’t remember what is/was said and I end up exhausted. When I can I use a combination of my crummy hearing and my crummy ASL to help with understanding- especially at conferences and the like where the environment is less than ideal. 

Identity is a spectrum - and frankly there isn’t a right answer. The only wrong one is if it doesn’t serve you well. 

So, in hearing communities I just say I’m deaf but will use hearing aids because I’m pretty sure no one in the room knows sign (that messes with them but they get it). 

In the broader disability world (I also use a wheelchair) I’ll say I’m deaf or deaf/hard of hearing as they have some kind of a clue. 

Within deaf groups I’ll sign in late deafened and still learning ASL and share my deaf journey. 

Hopefully that helps. It has worked for me.

As often comes up in these discussions, don't fixate too much on a label.  You're probably not offend other deaf/Deaf/HoH/etc. people when, at the end of the day, you can't hear.  I'll come back that point.

I was born with a mild-moderate loss.  I used to be able to pass as hearing in many contexts, without hearing aids.  Over time and after an injury that has become severe. 

I don't identify as capital-d Deaf because I'm just not culturally deaf.  I'm a beginner at ASL.  I was raised oral and still live oral.  But I cannot communicate orally without my hearing aids.  More importantly, I think, was when I realized, some of the time I don't want to - with or without them.

I'm sorry, but I can't understand you.  Like, I'm aware you're making noises.  But I'm tired and maybe my head is a bit more stuffed up than usual.  And I just can't bring myself to try and listen.  It's alien to me.  It's not natural.  It's not comfortable.  I don't want to and -- eh, I'm not going to right now.  I'm going to engage as if I can't hear because... well you know, it's because I can't hear!  

I used to say HoH but now I mostly say ""mostly deaf"".  ""Hard of hearing"" doesn't seem to sink in with most hearing people.  Maybe because it doesn't reflect the situation.

I have bilateral moderate to severe hearing loss in my ears. My hearing aids still work well. I identify as HoH or Deaf. I’ve been rejected by both communities based on the fact that I can’t hear (from hearing folks) and that I can speak well (from Deaf folks). I know ASL and I’ve tried to become friends with the Deaf community. I’ve struggled my entire life to feel like I belong…. Anywhere… but it hasn’t panned out for me. I’ve just accepted that this is how it is when you are in the middle of two identities. I’ve still found pride in my deafness. I still hold hope that I’ll be accepted by the community at some point, especially as I get older and my hearing gets worse.


Not related, My audiogram kinda looks like yours. I live near the area that this audiogram was taken. Would you recommend this audiologist? I need a new test and new hearing aids.

I’ve worn hearing aids for like 10-15 years, it’s honestly weirder when non deaf people notice them. I had a coworker i worked on roofs with just me and him, about 3 months in i swapped the batteries on my hearing aids and that was the first time he noticed. I also dated a girl 2 weeks she touched the side of my head like “Whoa what’s that?”

You're Deaf.

In the same way a blind person using a cane is still blind or a paraplegic using a wheelchair is still a paraplegic, deaf people using hearing aids are still deaf. Your assistive devices can’t negate your identity.

You can identify however you want. I have hearing aids. At work in the office, I’m HoH. It’s nice and quiet and I don’t have much trouble in conversation. Out and about running errands and there’s any other noise, I can’t understand anything. In that case, I’m deaf. Please wave to me when my order is ready.

I don’t know, you seem kind of deaf to me. Lol

It’s on a spectrum.

There was a boy who transferred to my elementary school. I go to deaf school but I am a hearing KODA but have APD so I am useless.

He use to bully me a lot or tried to. He was both deaf and not deaf depending on how he felt. He was angry at me for being better at ASL as I am native and he wasn’t, he was angry at the deaf children with CIs because for some reason he couldn’t get one.

He use to tell me my deaf family secretly hate me and thought I was stupid as I struggled to understand him. 

He was removed from school after trying to break other children’s hearing aids and I think homeschooled.

I think many people struggle with who they are. I am doing that right now 😭 I am hearing but to my deaf family I am useless because of APD and I hate myself for it. 

The embarrassment of not being out with family, having someone talk to use and I can’t understand them but due to a stutter I can’t get the words and so my completely deaf mom or sisters need to tell them we can’t hear or understand and I just think what am i why do I even exist what is the point in me hearing I hate it. So I feel the same. But you are deaf and should be proud to be deaf all my best friends and family are deaf and they are the best people I know, all of them are so cool and smart and have so many talents, I hope I can be as good as them when I get better with who I am.

Oh man, where do I start. I had been wearing hearing aids since 2016 for mild hearing loss; I hated that so much, but I could hear really well. Then I got into a car accident in 2023 and got SSNHL in September 2024. I lost all my hearing. I still struggle to hear with my cochlear implant in my right ear and nothing in my left ear. When I take off my cochlear implant I'm deaf. My advice: go to multiple doctors appts (ENTs, specialists). Your identity never changes. You are you. You just need hearing assistance or learn ASL. No one can take communication from you.

Yeah, you are deaf. No ifs or buts about it. I have a ci and my first language is asl, and regardless if I wearing the ci, I can’t pass for hearing.  If you hear so much with hearing aid, that’s good, but at the end of the day, once you take your hearing aid off, you’re deaf. These are just tools for you to function but.. you are still you. Don’t feel any different and whatever  helps you to get through the day

I was born deaf, raised as Deaf kid learned and was taught in sign language and abhorring full on oral method. I am Deaf as I can be, but I can speak with some speech training. But there are people who hate keep telling me I am not deaf enough becuz I spoke? So fuck em.

i struggle with deaf identity always! i’m quite deaf in both ears, i wear two hearing aids, only deaf person in my family. in the hearing world i’m too deaf, and i can’t keep up. in the deaf world i’m too hearing, because i was raised oral and am still primarily oral because the people around me don’t know how to sign. you can identify however you like, you know your own experience best :-)

a person who has hearing loss with always be deaf even if they have assistive devices which are tools. i get where you are coming from though. growing up, i felt that identity crisis as i have similar hearing loss. i can converse easily if the background noise is nonexistent and i can see the persons face so for the longest time growing up i did not feel like i fit the deaf identity so i would use hoh up until covid hit and the masks were a thing and i could no longer hold conversations easily because i cant see the persons mouth. yep, always deaf.

You are still deaf with or without a hearing aid. I recently had a discussion about this topic with someone and they insisted that you are not deaf without a hearing aid/ci, because you can hear. But that doesn't mean you understand everything. You will never have the normal hearing. It just gets better and you can retain information better.

It's probably due to the attitude we've been met with since we were children. ""Now you have a hearing aid, you can hear"", ""turn up the volume"", ""you hear what you want"".🫩 

You are deaf, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise if you think you are deaf! And I think it's better to say that you are deaf if your audiogram says so. Some people take ""I am hard of hearing"", ""I have poor hearing"" as something light. ""Oh. But you have a hearing aid, so that's fine"".

I didn't start calling myself ""deaf"" till I was in my 40s, despite being born literally deaf in my right ear (and HoH in my left). I feel like my hearing aids (Oticon BiCros) are a signal that yes, I AM deaf and not just trying to get attention. 

I also look at hearing aids like glasses. They're assistive devices. They help, not ""cure"".

I can hear decently with my hearing aids and still consider myself Deaf. You don't become un-disabled when you use an assistive device haha.",2025-06-25 23:45:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lklbzf/identity_crisis_when_wearing_hearing_aids/

try  r/podc

There are a lot of possible factors here, I like the suggestion to check with PODC. It could be that she is not ready, the current method isn’t working for her and needs changed, or that there may be additional missing piece of information (like maybe related to sensation, brain/body connections/etc). I’ve potty trained many deaf kids (former EEC TOD) and each one is different, some take to it naturally and others don’t. I’ve found that the pull-up/diaper off method is pretty effective so they learn the sensation of being wet, then can begin to connect that to their bodily sensations. I suggest chatting with other parents, connecting with other resources and providers, and trialing other methods and tools.

Sometimes, it’s just an internal switch that you don’t control. There are separate “switches” for number 1 and number 2. It’ll flip and she’ll go. Both of my daughters (hearing) were potty trained on their own schedule by 3 1/2 years old.

With both of my kids we took a long weekend, cleared our schedules and made the house comfortable.  We set out a training toilet that was always nearby and kept the kid naked the entire weekend.  They had accidents, but every time they got even a single drop in the toilet we showed it to them, had a little dance party, and heaped praise on them (and yes, we rewarded them with treats).  By the end of the long weekend they both were using the toilet.

My daughter refused to use the toilet until her younger brother used it. No problems after that.

Have to have a predictable schedule for them and they have to sit every time.  If they successfully go potty, celebrate it.  If not, go aw shucks.  Maybe next time.  They’re smart enough and will catch on.

I’m sure you’ve already went over the potty time video with Rachel a bunch of times?

Missing a lot of context here. How old is the child, what training methods were used, and what level is their language skills at?

What does her Deafness have to do with it? Standard potty training advice should apply.

Personally, my dad had the same issue with step-sibling. The kid was lazy, and didn't want to get up to use the potty (mainly if the tv was on or he was having fun playing), so he'd wet himself or demand a diaper.

What fixed it was taking away the kid's pants and underwear at home. He spent about a week ""bottomless"" during the day; he didn't have the choice to not run to the potty when he had to go. No issues after that.",2025-06-25 16:51:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lkaxhz/deaf_child_and_potty_training/

Quite simply, be honest with them. Explain what your new reality is.  Advocate your needs.  Hopefully they can be able to support you.

It’s a pita, I go through it too

I’ve just learned to accept it.  On Zoom I’ll just type comments and questions.

Do your best. But put on your Buddha hat. It’s an awkwardness you have to accept. Otherwise the small indignities become corrosive. Let them go.

I am still slow in interpreting human conversation, and, yeah, I interrupt too. I am apologetic about it. But, dammit, sometimes I want to say something too. The hearing just have to get used to it

Maybe not like you but I have APD, sometimes when I am shopping or out with my deaf family some people will come up and say something to us about something without knowing the family is deaf except me and my mom often turns to me and asks me did you here what  they said and I am like “I dunno I can’t understand???” It’s a little annoying because the person often thinks I am being rude or a badly behaved kid. I feel like we get a lot of “forget it never mind”.

You need a bit of a change of outlook.  You can't hear or at least can't hear as much as you used to, don't expect yourself to be able to hear.  Hearing people forget, and that's not fun, hearing people can discriminate (illegally) too so watch out for that.

If you're American have you worked with Vocational Rehabilitation in your state? They not only help people find new work but can help you stay gainfully employed at your current work.  (Helping you financially or paying for equipment can be unlikely based on your income though),

If you don't have specific alternative methods of communication that work for you see if you can either ask experts or find some peer support. I can't really offer ideas because I know nothing about  you and different ways work for different people and situations. One option though might be first talking to HR and requesting that your coworkers use MS Teams (or whatever instant messenger) instead of speaking to you as a form of formal communication, if you have a desk job.  You can also use apps like Live Transcribe (for android). It might even behoove you to buy a budget android phone without service just for that purpose, depending on your companies policies. Jump through whatever bureaucratic red tape HR needs you to jump through, people can get butthurt about these kinds of things and there's a lot of attack on diversity right now.

Good luck!

At first my friends and clients thought I was talking over them just because and I explained that isn't it. 

What I did was have them watch my transcriber so they saw what I saw. 

After that they understood I wasn't intentionally speaking over them, I either didn't know they were still talking or something else had slowed down my transcriber. 

I don't like to voice, which helps, but when I do, especially using a transcriber for ""hearing"" it's a regular thing.

I needed to hear all this right now. Thanks so much for all your comments.

All in all you seem pretty aware and fair minded . You are alert to the dynamic and trying to figure out how to finesse it at an early stage. Some people don’t get your awareness for years and years. Be a friend to yourself. Self compassion . Being late deafened by a sudden loss is a deeply traumatic experience. A good time to start counseling if you can get it. Truly it’s a tough experience.

It’s on them they have to accommodate to you if they don’t you can sue. This is discrimination. Plane simple..

Live it lol.

I am a KODA and native ASL who can hear but has APD. My whole life has been ASL, deaf day care, schools, clubs and friends. You don’t need all of that lol but the more you are part of the life the better you will be.

I don't know much about Guatemala but see if you can connect with others who are also learning it. There may even be a sign language meet up for the purpose of practicing it. Or you could start one.

You can practice a foreign language just by watching TV or reading but for sign language you pretty much need people to practice with. It helps memorising as well.

ASL is my second language. I remember by thinking about why the sign is the way it is. There are so many examples. 

I’m going to use ASL examples
- Cat is stroking their long whiskers
- Boy is grabbing a ball cap
- Girl is stroking the bonnet they used to wear
- Ugly is across the upper lip (hairy upper lip)
- black is across the eyebrows (they are often dark or black
- dry is across the chin which is often where I have dry patchy skin",2025-06-25 03:44:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ljvlum/any_recommendations_for_a_hearing_starting_with_sl/

start learning ASL so he always has access to language, with his CIs off, in noisy environments, if they break, if he doesn’t want to wear them. that gift of language is the biggest gift you could give him.

Start working on ASL asap. Find ways to get him around more children who are deaf while you continue developing his CI skills and attend speech therapy. At home, work on ASL. Language development is key, and more language is better. As he gets older he will have more and more building blocks for communication if you start now. Also, don't let anyone tell you that ASL will hinder your child's development. Continue to immerse him in a language rich environment and connect with professionals who can help you do that. Give him everything you can and don't cut off visual communication. 



While you're learning sign yourself, work on being as visual as possible. Think of yourself as a mime. I don't mean that miming replaces language, but communicating with him directly visually will help your connection later. Develop your sign skills and label everything in the house, constantly sign and also follow directions from your SLP to enhance his connections to vocabulary, signed and spoken. 

\-Teacher of the deaf

I am a deaf elderly mother/grandmother. I work PT at my local, county library. We have these 'Play-A-Longs'..... teach puzzles, alphabet, seek &amp; find, etc. Maybe, rent some kids movies with CC...SDH. He will learn to read. Buy him some books with Seek &amp; Find. i.e. he sees a 'key' now he has to find the key in the picture. We also have 'Read-A-Longs' too. Take him shopping and let him pick out some of his own clothes/shoes he LOVES! They got sneakers now that light up! My grandson loved those. Especially when he was outside playing in the night. A bike with training wheels? Or a Big Wheel bike?!

Hey I am a hearing child or KODA, but my whole family is deaf all my toys were passed to me from older sisters even though I was a boy. I had a lot of practical toys like a kitchen, dolls, Lego, mega blocks, painting, crayons. My mom and sisters are deaf so they chose toys I would play with in a place where they can see me. They also never got me new noisy toys because one I don’t like noise and two they don’t know if it is good for me or how noisy it is for people.

Apparently I enjoyed playing with car racing tracks because we could play them together and it was in one place but maybe too hard for a 3 year old I dunno.

ur doing amazing honestly, sounds like he’s making great progress! if u want smth fun n also personal for him, maybe a custom bobblehead of him with his fav toy like the tricycle or kitchen stuff? kids love seeing themselves in lil figures, it helps w confidence too. plus it’s smth he can keep as a memory of how far he’s come. u can get one at coupleofthings.net if u think he’d like it!

As someone who grew up deaf with family members who were very intent on making sure I learned to speak, I would avoid sound- and speech-based gifts, especially if he already has a lot of them. Oftentimes my family would get me things like speaking books, bop-its, etc. that relied on auditory cues so I always missed out on them, and could only watch as my brothers, cousins, and friends had fun with ease. As I got older it got more and more painful and felt like they didn’t care about what I actually enjoyed, and were more focused on molding me into what they wanted me to be. 

Go for more practical gifts. Some of my most cherished ones were things like puzzles (jigsaw but also secret opening puzzles), painting/art kits, and sports gear like rollerblades. He’s still very young so it’s also an opportunity to try new things. 

If he likes his kitchen set, maybe a garage/construction set or a science set? Pieces would certainly get mixed and matched but that was part of the fun for my nephew, who made nuts and bolts soup among other delicacies.

Get picture books. Read to him as much as possible. Kids that age love predictable books and will eventually want to read to you. I’m a strong believer that the more they can read the better for them.

So a scope is needed but I don't know who to talk to get it funded if I can?

I want to do the next level of the course but I'm having an issue with age,will they fund it if it's possibly only for a year?

I'm a bit worried since it's mild they'll say just suck it up,that's pretty much all the Tod said when I met them..

Assuming it is a Further Education/Higher Education course it should be covered by Disabled Students' Allowance from Student Finance England/SAAS. Your college should have a disability team who can help you apply.

https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowance-dsa/eligibility

There's a separate NHS Disabled Students Allowance if you're on an NHS Bursary:

https://faq.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/knowledgebase/article/KA-02303/en-us

If you're doing the course through an employer then Access to Work should cover it.

Whichever avenue, you'll need to supply proof of your hearing loss and have your need assessed. This should be very straightforward though, especially as you wear hearing aids. Based on Google, the cost is very much at the lower end of what these schemes are intended to cover (up to tens of thousands of pounds for support workers etc).

Also consider any other support you might need through these schemes.

I'm in the USA so my knowledge about the UK system is minimal.   

Are you already talking to Access to Work? They would be your first step I believe.  What is Tod in this context?

I'm from the states and we have something called The Department of Rehabilitation that will sometimes help with these things. 

I'm wondering if the UK has something similar. 

Maybe look at scholarships as well. 

Laughing At My Nightmare does scholarships, I'm not sure if your need would be approved/considered, or if they scholarship outside the states, but it's worth checking.

You could look at applying through Access to Work if it’s part of a college work placement. I’m a Teacher of the Deaf in the UK and we do support students to do this. Do you have a TOD?  It’s worth asking someone in your college about possibly applying for Access to Work, but the process can take a little while so it depends when your placement would start.",2025-06-24 18:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ljjlqy/how_do_i_get_a_bluetooth_stethoscope_funded_for/
1lja4te,deaf,How many times can a d/Deaf person ask me if I'm deaf/HoH before I should be taking that seriously?,"Really very, very sorry if this is a pain in the ass question. A bit under two years ago I had a comprehensive audiology appointment testing hearing and processing for suspected APD. It turned out not to be APD, but mild high range hearing loss. I was given some exercises that have proven unhelpful and the report to my doctor said to send me back to the audiologist in a year, because these results were a notable decline from the tests 12 months prior. My doctor, being my doctor, totally forgot about it and I assumed that just meant it wasn't important and carried on my life having to ask people to repeat themselves every thirty seconds. It's definitely gotten worse in the last 19 months, but I've been avoiding social situations and was out of work for a while, and all the people close to me know my hand gestures for adjusting speech volume or the Auslan fingerspelling if theyre too far away from me. 

But today it came to a head. I think my hearing might have just cost me a job I was interviewing for. Didn't even make it to the elevator before I had my hand to my ear trying to make out what the interviewer was saying, and the first question she asked (before she even introduced herself!) was about my ""hearing disability"" and what that entailed (I'm aware legally she couldn't ask that, but that's beside the point). And I had to ask her to repeat that statement. It's putting in perspective the way ever time I've spoken with an oral d/Deaf person in the last four years, within the first minute or so of conversation I've been asked if I'm deaf or HoH. This was a big issue in my last workplace where my deaf coworker and I had to balance who had to wear the department's headset when on together, because he felt it was very clear neither of us could hear through it and he called us the ""deaf department"" on more than one occasion. 

I'm booking an appointment to get my hearing re-tested anyway, stuff the doctor referral. I'll pay out of pocket. But what's weighing on me is how badly I fumbled that question in the interview today. I've been comfortable when both my old d/Deaf friends, my deaf coworker at my last job, and multiple casual acquaintances and contacts who were d/Deaf or HoH referred to me as HoH, because I figured that was their prerogative to call it what they like. But I realised if I get asked about that on a call-back from that job (or have to explain to my disability employment agency why I fumbled a job due to an issue I've never brought up before), I... think I need to pull my head out of the sand and know what to call this. I've been telling myself it's awfully presumptive to think I'm HoH based only on mild high range hearing loss and the distinguishing speech from background noise impairments I've been dealing with for years. But was my old coworker and my old friends actually right, there? If I get asked another time if I'm HoH... what do I answer?

I'm not so good at reddit, I'm really sorry if I've picked the wrong sub-reddit to ask this in and this is a hearing person invading a d/Deaf space moment, please don't hesitate to tell me off if it is.

You have diagnosed hearing loss. You are hard of hearing. Period. ""Mild"" loss is still clinically significant, or else they wouldn't diagnose it! 

If you are interesting in hearing aids, you should ask about them. I have mild hearing loss and I have hearing aids, and they help me so much.

I think you’re in you head too much about this. It’s literally hard for you to hear. You’re hard of hearing.

I have mild hearing loss and got a little pushback when I went to the audiologist. She was like well it’s mild idk if you TRULY need them. It was causing me problems at work bc I work in healthcare and it can get noisy/crowded. So I did need them… they made a huge difference for me at work and also with the ability to go out to dinner and have a conversation. Definitely look into it even if your loss is “mild”!

To address some concerns:

-Mine are fairly decent at amplifying conversation level noise only

-Mine has a specific setting called “party” (Widex brand) that does even more filtering and it’s directional. So I have to face the person but I turn that on in a crowded environment like a restaurant but it works like a charm for me tbh

-I still do get a lot of background noise that took me awhile to get used to, I honestly don’t wear them at home, and for awhile I needed to take regular hearing aid breaks at work bc of that. (ETA apparently a lot of this noise is just normal to hearing people lolololol but I don’t like it and I don’t have to hear it if I don’t wanna!)

-When I have gone to concerts, or any other extremely loud environment, I swap them out for earplugs. Not ideal for conversation, but I did forget to turn them off with a DJ once and INSTANT REGRET hahaha

You're too fixated on labeling. Frankly, the other person may not even know or use them the same way. 

Outside the whole job interview scenario, consider and practice how you want to articulate the extent of your hearing to people who matter to you, such as meeting a new coworker, or your partner's family. 

For instance, I summarize mine something along the lines as ""an average person sounds mumbly to me but I hear higher frequencies better. Which means if *you* think someone is mumbling, I definitely cannot make out their speech. And my mom's yelling is always crystal clear!""",2025-06-24 12:44:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lja4te/how_many_times_can_a_ddeaf_person_ask_me_if_im/

Sometimes I couldn’t hear anything. He advised me a cochlear device, but also told me I need to stay on top of ear cleaning because apparently I was born with wax that clogs up super easily. After dropping $100+ on appointments, I said screw it and grabbed one of those camera ear cleaners on Amazon (I got the Loyker one for like $25). Wasn’t expecting much, but holy hell it works. Gross, yes. But effective. I could see everything, and the amount of gunk was unreal. Now all my friends joke, “Congrats, you’ve unlocked DIY ENT level.” And honestly? They’re not wrong.

1lizolb,deaf,"CODA or deaf friends, what do you do for work? How is it? I don’t know what I could do.","Teacher asked us today what it is we want to do and I couldn’t answer. Everyone else had such good ideas. 

I am a KODA who is native ASL and going through deaf schools, I am autistic and seem to have a hearing issue like APD as well as difficulty speaking. 

A few years ago I thought I could be an interpreter but my speaking and hearing has not gotten better and is obviously not related to my life within the deaf community. 

My school said there is a good path for me to work there as a career in the future. My signing is perfect and I am good with people but it feels like a lot of responsibility. My mom also said there is a good chance for me to work at her company. Both of them sound good but working with my mom sounds easiest and fun. 

Spoke to my counselor at school and she said I could work within the deaf community but working outside of it may be challenging as I wouldn’t be able to get the same benefits a deaf person can with interpreters or other assistance, however she said she will discuss it with some disability services as she isn’t 100% and told my mom to do the same to see what would be available. 

I am going to be assessed again for Autism and APD so she said once that is written down I may get more help and protection. 

So I was wondering what you guys do? Is it hard? Any big problems? Do you find it fun? 

Thank you as always guys!!

Edit: found out you can edit your post? 

I’m sorry my post is confusing, I am not good at writing things I think. I guess what I wanted to ask is what jobs can you do that let you use ASL? What jobs are available if you struggle to hear or have difficulty with speaking? Or maybe jobs that let you work by yourself? Also what do people here do? And how hard has it been to find a job? 

I just wish everyone was made to be able to use ASL. ",2025-06-24 02:31:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lizolb/coda_or_deaf_friends_what_do_you_do_for_work_how/

1lhutyt,deaf,Struggling with communication,"Hi everyone,
I’m 27F hard of hearing and speech impaired, and I mainly use my voice to communicate with my family because they don’t know ASL. I’ve been learning ASL since 2023 and even graduated with an associate’s degree in it this year.

I’ve been teaching my mom some ASL to help us communicate better, but she isn’t consistent with practicing or using it. On top of that, when I try to communicate with her using my voice, everything I say seems to get misconstrued or misunderstood.

It’s really exhausting and makes me feel isolated because I’m trying my best to connect, but it feels like I’m not being heard or understood.

Has anyone else experienced this with their family? How do you cope or improve communication when voice isn’t fully working? I’d really appreciate any advice or support.

My paediatrician was not always very patient or kind.

So, back to the NHS. How long was the wait for hearing aids? How do you feel you were treated by the doctors? I'm scared it will take forever, and I don't know how I feel about being visibly deaf (I.e having visible hearing aids, I'm guessing the NHS will not provide in - ear ones). I am also concerned the NHS will try to provide just amplifiers rather than actual hearing aids.

1lgrght,deaf,Family meeting about noise update and thank you to everyone here!,"So every week we order food and eat round the dining table and talk about our week. I decided now was a good time to talk about noise.

It went well, did what people said here.

First we talked construction and my sister said she was surprised I hadn’t just slept in her room. I used to do it a lot but stopped when she got a bf but I dunno why since she broke up but I guess I’ll be staying in there until it finishes.

About the desk, my other sister thought it was noisy, but since I never complained thought it was maybe not noisy. She said she will try and be quieter and my mom’s going to look at it to see why it’s noisy and ask me what the noises are. Someone here suggested a foam desk pad? Or something and my mom said she will get one.

The toilet seat, my mom actually thought we had a soft close but it isn’t working so she was planning to replace it.

For the doors she is going to look for a some kinda soft close doors or something like our kitchen draws. She said she wasn’t happy with them because she also felt the vibrations in bed so she was also getting annoyed. 

A lot of people suggested earplugs like loop, my mom knows about them and said she will get them for me to try. 

My mom said she will take me to her doctor to get my hearing testing like someone here suggested. To see if some noisy are painful. 

One thing she told me that I had forgotten or maybe I was too young to remember. Is that I saw a doctor as a child and did some tests and it was said I am autistic or maybe autistic, this actually hurt to hear and upset me. I was suppose to be re tested but a lot of things happened between and I wasn’t and so she wants me to get retested. 

Anyway we got switch 2 so played Mario kart which was fun. 

Thank you for your help everyone!

This is a fantastic update 🩵 Thanks for updating us. 

All those sound like great solutions. I'm so glad your family is willing to listen to your concerns and find solutions. 

If you turn out to be on the spectrum, it doesn't change who you have been your whole life. And who you are, seems to be a good person that thinks about others. :)

For the doors, there is a hinge type called ""soft close hinge"" that can help. 


They are more expensive than regular hinges but in this case it is probably the best option if you still want the door to be able to close. 


If you don't care if the doors close all the way you can get a little foam blocks that go over the corner and soften the closing. They will keep the door open just a bit though.",2025-06-21 08:12:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lgrght/family_meeting_about_noise_update_and_thank_you/
1lgnqq4,deaf,Deaf Artists/Etsy Sellers?,"Hello all!

I’m a hearing ASL interpreting student and hoping to add some ASL-related art, stickers, and maybe some select articles of clothing, jewelry, or other accessories to my life. 

But, obviously, only if they’re made by Deaf creators!

I know 58Creativity, and have my eye on quite a few items there, but would love to check out other artists and makers!

I was also thinking about getting some custom items with my name fingerspelled, but when I went to search on Etsy I realized what a time consuming task it would be to click on individual listings that come up in a search, and then try to determine if the creator/shop owner is Deaf. 

Side note: normally, I’d just take all the checking artists’ and sellers’ profiles as a small respite from my usual doom-scrolling, but my mom just had a small stroke ~2.5 weeks ago. So almost all of my time and energy has been being spent trying to stay on top of her doctors and nurses to make sure they’re giving her proper care and administering her medicines on time, preparing for her to come home and care for her, learning a bit about stroke recovery, and a whole slew of other unexpected sole caregiver/immediate relative responsibilities that have suddenly cropped up. All on top of the fact that I’m disabled with conditions that cause chronic pain and fatigue, myself. So I’ve just been super extra exhausted every day. I’ve even had to take a couple breaks just writing this post 😅

So I figured I’d come here to crowd source suggestions for known Deaf/HoH artists and creators 😊

I appreciate any and all suggestions, and if you yourself are an artist, please share!

Thanks in advance for your help, everyone 🤟🏻

1lg6nyw,deaf,Just saw the phrase ‘mind-deaf’ and I’m not sure how to feel,"It was used to describe inner ear aphantasia (or whatever word the auditory equivalent is), meaning someone who can’t conjure a sound in their mind (just like with aphantasia where you can’t picture something in your mind). They can’t compose music or envision a sound in their mind.

I personally feel super weird about the phrase, but maybe this is an overreaction due to the abundance of ableism out there and I’m just extra sensitive to someone writing an encouraging post about struggling with being ‘mind-deaf.’

[댓글]
I was thinking this could be about something like auditory processing disorder, which is like, arguably because your mind can't process the audio signals? Or something like aphasia or other language processing disorders. Even then I wouldn't love the terminology- the terminology for the disorder is the most accurate for what it is. But for something like aphantasia?? Yeah, absolutely not. Your ear works fine, your brain pathways for processing sound work fine, just no inner voice. Just my opinion, however.

As a deaf person who has antaphasia, I absolutely would not call myself “mind-blind” that’s wild. 

But I hadn’t even considered this was something as well.
Personally, I don’t find antaphasia to be a disability, even as an artist. It’s how I have always lived, and it is what helped fuel my creativity. 
But, I can absolutely see where people struggle with it in terms of acquired conditions. I imagine it is similar to this condition as well.

With this condition I imagine it affects a persons inner voice more than anything. But it’s a stark difference from any degree of hearing loss and the types of barriers that are placed in our ways.

I always really try to be aware of my reactions to these situations as everyone is on their own journey, but this feels extra icky.
I never like to minimize others experiences to make myself feel good. But the term is just making me feel icky.
Perhaps the terminology should reference antaphasia as antophono-something. 

I can imagine if the phrase does take off, then the users may get typical responses that deaf folks receive. Which, I can imagine may lead to frustrations in that community and ours.

I have never heard this personally but I do get it, and most just refer to it as an “inner voice” and that some hear it, some don’t. I see you have said maybe they’re referring specifically to auditory things so I guess I may be out of the loop there? 

You may be experiencing just someone specifically using terminology incorrectly also or just in a way that they see fit but it doesn’t really fit for me and I doubt others would think it fits.

The idea that you are “mind deaf” feels like a way for someone to suggest they’re “also deaf” and include themselves in the community and culture. I am not judging this but I am simply suggesting maybe this is the case.

I know I have certainly experienced people trying to appear more “deaf” to be included more in group situations. (Often tended to be hard of hearing or people with damage to their ear and some deafness but they don’t use sign or involve with deafness so it’s odd for me sometimes but I don’t judge folks for wanting to feel inclusion I suppose)

There’s various types of deafness. I dont have a problem with someone discussing mind-deafness as a better way of describing their own issue. It’s clear they’re talking about themselves and not pretending to be a signer. 

Although if they learnt signing they’d be very welcome. They might actually start preferring it to spoken language if they found it easier to form thoughts in their mind in sign language rather than in whatever they use instead of spoken language. 

Deep science follows: 

Important to be clear, the neurolinguistic centres in the brain operate independently of the auditory centres. This is what enables reading, writing, and yes, signing, to operate without verbally needing to sound out every word.  

The idea that signing impacts speech is neurological bullshit and was debunked many years ago by brain scans. Any professional still saying this is guilty of professional malpractice and wilful discrimination. 

Furthermore there is some evidence that genetically, human language centres in the brain have a closer relationship to handedness (left hand / right hand preference) than to sound perception or noise production. 

It is tempting to say that human language is more closely related to signing than to speech, but the science evidence is not quite there yet.

Kinda bothers me tbh there’s so much behind the word Deaf and deaf that someone hearing using it to describe an inner voice lack just sounds wrong

I'm not familiar with this phrase. 

All it did was remind me of ""hearing mind.""

That's a very different meaning.

1lfweal,deaf,How can I get my deaf family to understand noise better?,"Live with mom and 3 sisters all totally deaf. They say they understand noise and apologize but it makes it hard for me.

Noises that lately cause me problems are the toilet seat and doors slamming, stomping, dropping things, my sister stays up late playing games which are muted but they are loud at the desk.

Right now there is construction outside our house and it is so noisy, I am woken up early every day because of it. ChatGPT also says I have misophonia so some noisies are awful like scratching jeans or forks and knives on plates. 

I feel tired all the time, and I feel like I always have a headache. I feel like if they can’t see me they think the noise is lower or I can’t hear, or they just forget I can hear. 

How can I explain to them nicely without hurting them that some noises are causing me problems? I have always tried to ignore it but my teachers have complained I am falling asleep in class and my mom thinks my signing has become a little rude and snappy but I am just tired and have headaches. 

Our relationships are great so I don’t want to upset anyone. Thank you.

Just a general comment: PLEASE do not let ChatGPT diagnose you with anything. It hallucinates, it gets extremely basic stuff wrong, it cites dates that don’t exist. It cannot be trusted with simple baseball stats, let alone anybody’s mental health.

Hmm. Is it possible to make some physical changes to make it easier on you? My partner is hearing and the toilet slamming closed was something that frequently woke him up. We got a soft close toilet lid (slowly closes, no slamming!) and it helps a lot. It was $12.99 at Walmart. 

Also looking into felt pads to put in the door frames and cabinets. We have to run the AC some nights since it’s been really hot, and the AC helps drown out some of my noise. So if I knock something over while I make coffee, less chance it disturbs my sweetheart! 

One approach that might help: make a list of the most noisy areas in the house, share the impact, share one potential solution, then ask “Can you guys help me make some changes to the house?” Because then it’s a matter of changing your environment to suit your entire family. Another thing—maybe take the opportunity to mention a remote LED light or flashing lights in a spot that would be helpful. Something that would benefit your deaf family members and make communication or other tasks easier. Then it turns into a matter of accessibility and comfort for everyone.

Some other questions to consider:

- Is your bed up against a noisy wall or space? Would it help to move the bed?

- If there’s any budget, soft close cabinet hardware? Rugs and rug pads?

- Is clutter an issue? I often try to be light on my feet and do my early morning stuff quietly, but clutter is what gets me. I knock things over or make a lot of clattering noise when the counter isn’t clear.

You didn't state how old you and your sisters are but I would also consider holding a family meeting to approach this. Tell calmly what has been bothering you and how it has been negatively influencing your health and studying and try to find solutions together.

Perhaps also put up small reminder notes. Put one above the toilet seat or next to the door ""please close quietly"".

Hey OP lots of people recommending ear plugs, but I’d like to add white noise as an option. It’s more comfortable than wearing earplugs and makes a constant noise that covers more of the house noises. 

The awful noises that you describe are pretty typically described and awful. Based solely on your description, I don’t think you have misophonia. Knives and forks on plates can be something akin to nails on chalkboard depending on how they are hit/rubbed on them. It may be that different plates make a difference. I’d recommend trying thicker plates like stoneware or going to paper or plastic. It may be that with more sleep this bothers you less, but it’ll likely never go away 100%. 

Recommendation for starting your meeting. Saying that you’re not getting enough high quality sleep and it’s impacting you. Be prepared for electronics to come into question and for an earlier bed time to be proposed and have a plan for that. Tell them that you keep getting woken up in the middle of the night and in the morning from the construction. Blame the recent change in behaviour on the construction and ask for help getting a better night sleep to compensate. Let them know you’ve given it some thought and done some research to come up with a few ideas to get the ball rolling. 

Proposed improvements:
- soft close toilet seat
- soft close door stoppers for cabinets, or the clear plastic domes specifically designed for this
- slower closing of the doors between rooms, especially when windows are open because it makes it easier to accidentally slam a door.
- felt pads for the bottom of chairs
- telling them that you can hear when they are walking around and ask for softer feet on the ground. 
- telling them that knives and forks are loud on their plates while they are eating (is this the most important thing to you, or is it getting more sleep? I wonder if more sleep will allow you to be more tolerant to this noise)
- modifications to sister’s desk to help quiet things down such as different keyboard or mat under it to reduce banging, fabric coaster to dampen the noise of putting it down. (See if you can truly identify what your sister is doing that is so loud and see if this can be modified) 
- move your sister’s desk further away from your sleeping area
- white noise playing off your phone while you are sleeping. There are also white noise machines, or even using a fan. 
- ear plugs if the white noise doesn’t work. 

There may be some additional advice or other ideas on a CODA sub.

There’s only so much a deaf person can do to regulate their volume. Two suggestions to consider are to get a decibel meter and place it prominently in the home so they can be more aware and to get yourself some noise canceling headphones for when it’s particularly bothersome. Hope that helps.

I can’t address the family dynamic as I am not from a Deaf family, but do you have a white noise machine? My mom is the lightest sleeper in the world and growing up I woke her up constantly; it was a huge point of contention in our relationship no matter how hard I tried to be quiet. She got a white noise machine a couple years ago and she says it would have changed her life to have it for decades before. When I visit now I can actually move around the house without waking her up. It helps kind of drown out and quiet the sounds people make.

I’m hearing, fluent signer and ASL major, my former roommate was Deaf (still is, we just don’t live together anymore lol).

I ran into this a lot, he’d come home at like 2am slamming pots and pans around to make a grilled cheese sandwich, slam doors, slam the toilet lid, all that kind of stuff. 

I was passive aggressive about it one day and snuck up on him and touched the back of his arm with one of those back massage guns on full speed. He was so pissed but I told him that the surprise that he felt is the equivalent of the sounds he made at 3am and that he was lucky that I couldn’t make the lights in the living room brighter to retaliate. After that, he made more of an effort to be quieter. 

While I was wrong and do not advise the passive aggressive approach, I do think that comparing it to vibration is a close way to explain.

My mom used to wake up at 3am and do chores like dishes. A lot of times she would bang everything around and make a ton of noise. I woke up and came downstairs from my bedroom and said “Mom! That’s loud!” She looked at me and said “no it’s not, go back to sleep.” I know, right???

So the next time she fell asleep in front if the TV, I got a flashlight and shined it right in her face to wake her up. She got mad and said “that’s bright!” Guess what I said?

You can use vibration as an equator to sound

If it’s partly the desk keyboard making a noise, you can put a mat underneath it.

Have misophonia and a Deaf husband. Quick practical suggestion: buy melamine plates. No scratching noises from silverware.

i'm Deaf and try not to be tooooooo loud, but i can't always control it--my kids are really young and i'm always running around.

a)can you use felt pads with sticky backs for cabinet doors, and a slow-closing toilet lid????? find them all on amazon, add all to cart, and show your mom! 

b)gently ask your mom and sisters to have a family meeting. compare being constantly triggered by loud noises to them living life with unpredictable strobe lights. anywhere they go, anything they do, random strobe lights. ask if they'd have constant headaches too, or eye aches, or a combination of both.

then, as you bring up your felt pad and slow-closing lid solutions, ask if they could practice being quiet consciously during a certain time of day, and maybe if they do this, and really practice, it'll become a more consistent thing all day. 

BEST OF LUCK

i have RECENTLY been told my kids scream and yell a lot 😱😱😱 because i call for them from any room in the house, they talk at the same volume. that is gonna be hell to undo, and i keep forgetting i'm trying to re-train them cuz i can't hear. 

so, deafness can ruin lives 🤣🤣🤣

Hey! Have the meeting and tell them. But also look into noise cancelling headphones! I’m very hard of hearing and one person in my family has neurodivergence that makes noises hard to handle. I work on being quieter and they work to wear the headphones when annoyed and we coexist really well. It just takes both people being willing to try to help each other out

The problem is that Deaf people easily forget this because we aren’t constantly reminded of the sounds and noises. Just like you aren’t continually reminded of that, let’s say that scented products is a hell to sensitive people. Because you don’t suffer of it yourself. 

I think the solution isn’t to *nag* because we don’t know. I hate being nagged. But workarounds is better. Soft-closing toilet lid is an excellent example suggested by many. 

Maybe also insulators on walls, dampening noises (like in recording studios), thick carpets. Replacing noisy keyboards with quiet. 

Reminding is okay, but saying things like “you should know how awfully noisy you are?!” As if we would know? No, we don’t know. But saying “Right now you’re being noisy, can you stop doing (thing) now?” Is more okay if it doesn’t clash with their own needs. 

And you should explore options of noise cancellers and white noise. You never know, you may end up somewhere equally noisy but without deaf people. There’s SO many noise sources, even from hearing people. So coping strategies is good.

We are aware that we can make sounds, but in the moment of heat we forget. Even more so if the person has ADHD. Also “we are aware of that we can make sounds”, it isn’t easy by itself, as we don’t know what’s painfully noisy, and what’s tolerable. (To normal people. Misophonia level is extra difficult)

Loop earplugs are pretty good. I wear them when I go to Deaf events and it gets loud.

Sound barriers like music foam in the windows for now

sorry to say that but I’m deaf and im very aware whether I make noises, I’m very respectfully of not making noises to annoy my hearing brother in the household like not slamming door, toilet seats or anything. all u can try is to buy earplugs to block out the noises.

Wear ear plugs? 

Sometimes I tends to forget that my family is hearing. I wear hearing aids but sometimes I still forget that some things are still noisy. Maybe have paper and tape on table mentioned “don’t bang on the table” or “don’t slamming the door” on the door. I don’t know if that would work or not but it may help.

Ear plugs, or the Loop ones to dampen the sound.

hey. Google ""door quieters."" i just did! plenty of options and for cabinets, doors, etc.

I would try Loop earplugs to start. Maybe explain to them through movement. Like this noise is low and effects me like “move hand” this is louder and effects me like “move who arm” this noise is even worse and effects me like “whole body shaking” etc. visual and physical representation.

Honestly apart from not playing video games at night, most of these just sound like normal  human things you can't go anything about.


I'd définatly suggest earplugs as an option, alpine sleep deep are really comfy for night time, she flare calmer are not earplugs, but still helpful for people that are sound sensitive. Otherwise noise cancelling headphones, or any musician quality earplug will block out the worst of the sound but still let you hear people

Hey OP! I’ll just chime in with a recommendation for earplugs: browse the web for ‘silicone putty’ earplugs (the brand I’m familiar with is “Mack’s”). 

These things are surprisingly comfortable! I have a family member who works on big ships with insane noise levels basically 24/7, and this is the only way he could get some adequate rest. The foam earplugs don’t fit his ears well and tend to fall out overnight. Since these are moldable, they’ll fit your ears regardless of the shape. 

However, if you currently use an audible alarm, you may need to get a physical/vibration alarm to wake you up instead…or so I’ve heard.",2025-06-20 05:50:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lfweal/how_can_i_get_my_deaf_family_to_understand_noise/
1lfodfy,deaf,Does autistic deaf people are also expressive or are they blunt,"So, okay, basically I'm just interested. I'm an autistic woman with a flat voice: basically i don't have any sort of emotional tone on my voice usually. I can make my voice more emotional if i want, but usually unless i cry or yell my tone is flat. I guess if you're fully deaf/hoh since birth it might be appear like you do the signs with no expression whatsoever. Now, i know some sign language of my area and i know its about expressions, the tone you make in that sign changes the meaning. But i kept thinking about this. Any autistics (self-diagnosed, diagnosed, everything will do) to answer my question? 

[댓글]
Referring to myself as AuDHD, so sampling pool = 1, so only 1 person.
I’m a messy signer, and was scolded in my childhood for signing too fast, too wide, too wild, too sloppily. (School in 80s, hearing teachers)

The only person I know having acquired autism diagnosis as adult, she seemed to sign normally, from what I could remember? (30 years ago…)
I don’t want to armchair diagnose people so I don’t know about others. 

So I guess some might sign a little quirky, some normally? So I guess that’s analogous to hearing autists, some speak normally some speak in non-normal way. (Robotic speech isn’t the only “autism style” of speaking). Autism is a spectrum after all.

My autistic side impacts the signing in another way too: i get way too exhausted when I’m with deaf people, I need to recover for 2-5 days after. (So intense!) I got burnt out in school so I had to quit school. All the eye contact, all the interpreting the face details, while keeping up with the flow… Though, this is *me*, sampling pool = 1 so I can’t talk for other Deaf autistic. Maybe others will chip in.

I’m born deaf and I learned sign language before I became 1 years old (in the 70s) thanks to fantastic parents. They’re hearing with zero experience of deaf people but they were firm on wanting to give me best opportunity) I hated the hearing aids so they didn’t push it on me. So sign language is my native language, but I’ve chosen to use written language to spare on my energy levels. Swedish. English is only for online stuff.

I work with Deaf and hard-of-hearing autistic folks, both kids and adults. I am neurodivergent (ADHD) but don’t know whether I have autism or not. 

One of the unique factors at play here is their inherent language skills and whether there’s any language deprivation at play. Language deprivation happens when a child doesn’t fully master any native language (signed or spoken) due to insufficient *accessible* input. Children and adults with language deprivation may learn some signs but they often don’t use facial and spatial grammar, regardless of whether they also have autism. Their sentences can be hard ro understand, even if you are fluent in ASL. Significant language deprivation results in the child developing an intellectual disability. So if someone is autistic and has an intellectual disability and/or language deprivation, their signing may be more impacted by the latter. 

In any case, some Deaf and hard-of-hearing autistic people do have a flat signing tone (similar to a flat voice tone). They might do the facial expressions that have grammatical meaning in ASL but no extra for tone or emotional expression. Other Deaf ppl in their lives often think they are mad at them when they are not. Some folks simply use language that is extra direct and blunt, even for Deaf folks, but common among autistic folks. For example, they  might ask “Why?” for everything they don’t understand and be perceived by others as challenging their authority or being difficult. Some folks, their autism shows up more in other ways, like the way they think or say things, and not that much in signing tone or expressiveness. Just like hearing autistic people, there’s a lot of variation. Different individuals have different abilities and desire to mask.

I was HoH growing up, and never got immersed into deaf culture bc there wasn't really ever one around me (small towns). So i can't speak about signing, but I also speak very blunt, and very flat. I'm 40 now, and still, terrible, terrible at small talk. How i speak is very influenced by what I read recently (taking on the ""voice"" of whatever material I read). I have a 3 yr old that is autistic and scripts, and I wonder if it's my own way of scripting (but im not an expert here). I also am terrible with sympathy and feeling emotions. Joy? What's that? Couldn't say I've ever experienced it, For example.

Blunt yes. Sometimes being Deaf makes it more worse on bluntness ; and depends on each person own personality if expressive or not.
Info dumping/robotic cadence especially stressed/anxious or frustrated.  Signing is normal/but can be very fast to keep up with speedy thinking. Sometimes if not understanding something get frustrated very easily.  If feel not understanding that NO will come very fast 
Need to understand fully. Sometimes even will go into rabbit holes on stuff until understanding it fully before satisfied with it. 
Hyper focus is very real thing. Hate disputing hyper focus and will get frustrated/angry
Disputing routine is frustrating too. 
Signing and stimming is actually similar so find specific signs and repeating as stimming

My little brother has severe ADHD and when he signs, it’s all over the place sometimes. He flicks to different subjects and doesn’t sign properly. He used to get a lot of shit forgot as a child until he was diagnosed and everything suddenly made sense. Back then it wasn’t so common to be diagnosed with the ADHD.

1lfn8nw,deaf,What is it like for people with cochlear implants?,"I'm likely going to have to get cochlear implants in the future as I'm losing hearing in my only good ear and im curious to how cochlear implants compare to regular hearing. Ive heard some people say that over time it felt like how their hearing was before they were deaf, does this hold true for a lot of people? What did it feel like at first if you got CIs?

[댓글]
Been a good while since I got mine done now (2017). I have bilateral CIs and started with the nucleus 7. When I first had them switched on for the first time It was unbelievably loud. Like everyone's voices were screeching and overly robotic, very overwhelming for sure! I couldn't understand people basically at all for a bit, I took them off again when I got outside the hospital because nah I could not LOL. It took me a couple of months to truly adjust like give or take 3-6 months for the robotic sounding voices to start sounding like normal and the ear piercing screeching to return to normal levels. When I was around my parents and we were outside, I started asking them loads of questions of the sounds I was hearing around me like the birds for example cause I had never heard them before at least when they were distant.

At this current moment in time people's voices whenever that would be connected to my bluetooth devices or simply hearing people day to day do not sound robotic at all, they sound just my version of normal so yeah like how I heard before my CIs. I'm profoundly deaf without them and with my CIs it brings me up to the mild to severe range! It's still a humongous improvement either way even if it's not perfect! 

Hope this helps a bit!

Got mine in 1998. Within a few days of having it turned on, my hearing was better than it had been in years.

Now, to be clear: my hearing still sucks. Missing what people say is an everyday thing. But I probably have better hearing now than I did for a decade before I went totally deaf.

I only had bells and whistles at activation 5 years ago, it was somewhat scary. The worst of those sounds faded within two weeks, but it took a good few months to get usable speech recognition.

Nowadays the sound doesn't seem any worse than it did with hearing aids prior to the surgery and I hear a lot more sounds than before. In my experience from interacting with a lot of CI experiences, compared to natural hearing the quality is not that good, but if someone is comparing the CI to their hearing with hearing aids, it gets pretty similar, as both use microphones.

Great idea to ask people in this forum. Smartest and most practical info you can get PLUS support for whatever you decide to do! 
I am a bilateral CI recipient and recently upgraded from Sonnets to Rondo 3. I’m still learning the new functionality. Key to understanding the best you can is to do the exercises daily as Prescribed. I did 30 minutes twice a day. More is not better. Different is: TV, audio books, etc. 
First ask your medical facility how many implants they’ve done of each manufacturer (there are three). Ask why   And how people picked the manufacturer. And ask their success rate. 
Yes, it’s sounds like an interview. It is! It’s also a good way to detach from some of the emotions. Talk about this with the forum here, family and friends. 
Ask your facility for names of people who have volunteered to be references for each manufacturer. Contact them and interview them. It helps if you can talk to someone who has a lifestyle similar to yours. You can ask how they understand in different situations. Understanding is different from hearing. 
Each manufacturer has a Facebook group of users and people who are considering CIs. Ask questions there too. Knowledge is power. Ask how people handled the stress of deciding whether to get them or not and which manufacturer to choose. What was their biggest challenge? What’s the best reason to go with CIs? 
My answer to that is the increasingly high success rate AND that CIs give you hearing in pitches your ear can no longer hear. Birds are still a huge thrill for me. Music comes more slowly but it’s getting there. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Good luck!!

I feel like I'm a person who can turn on and off hearing. Tho it's not really an answer you were expecting. I was born deaf and got CIs at a very young age so I don't know what non deaf people hear sounds like.

Mine sounded robotic for the first 8 weeks. Speech was crystal clear, just like it was put through a robot mickey mouse voice filter. After that time frame, it went back to how it was before my hearing loss. It's about 90% the same as before; a few sounds are *just a little bit different*, but nothing that really matters. I still listen to music as much as I used to.

It's important to mention that the time frame varies on the person. From talking with others, 1-3 months is the norm, but my doctor was very upfront that sometimes it can take up to a year.

1lf8mgq,deaf,Diagnosed deaf teen vent / story,"So I have finally been diagnosed as deaf after having two hearing tests and a MRI on my ear drums which showed nothing. Apparently some of the cells in cochlear are not upright making it harder for them to pick up sounds . I first went to a hearing test when I was about 5 I think. They said my hearing was ""fine"" and told my mum its just some fluid in the ears from the cold you had a couple of weeks ago. When I got my first hearing test the lady doing it was stunned by how this hadn't been picked up. Any way after the first hearing test she said she would give me a trial one well that never happened fast forward a few months late after the other hearing test and MRI I am getting into a hearing place so I can get some hearing aids. 

The only thing is that I feel like my hearing is good even though I sucked at the hearing test and can barely hear shit all. Is this because I am just so used to it?

Also school wise I am scared of getting bullied since I am already the number one punching dumby at my school 🥲 ( that a figure of speech. But I do get hit sometimes as well as names which sucks!) 

Lastly what things do the schools need to know about and what issues may arise to say my hearing aid lost battery or one fell out ? Could wearing one instead of two work for at school ? I also play high league soccer are there special ear molds to help keep them in when playing high contact sports and sweatingnand running? What do I do if it rains? 


[댓글]
A lot depends on what country you're in, in terms of what schools can do for you.  I have plenty of info about the US system but... 

As far as thinking your hearing is fine - yeah, there is to some degree a sense of ""getting used to it"" and not realizing how much you're missing.  You may also only be missing certain ranges (higher, lower) and getting ""enough"" of the speech banana that you didn't feel it was worth kicking up about. 

In terms of sports, well fitted hearing aids and molds don't fall off and are more resistant to sweat issues.  They do make headbands that are both to catch sweat and help keep hearing aids in. For rain, honestly, I just take mine out to be on the safe side even though they do make ""sport"" hearing aids that are sweat/water ""resistant"" but not fully protected.  Again this also depends on what kind you get.  

Personally I hate the hearing aids that are tiny and fit in your ear ""invisible!!"" because that's just BS.  They're hard to get out, easy to lose, hard to fix, hard to replace batteries/charge... I'm old though and I WANT people to see the hearing aids and molds so they know I'm Deaf before I need to tell them why I failed to hear them or failed to understand what they're yapping at me about.  When I was going through school, I intentionally chose bright colored molds.  

I also suggest avoiding the type of earmold where there's a thin wire and a tiny mold on the end that goes in your ear canal... same problem. People keep pulling on the wire to take it out, and then the wire breaks and it's just a pain in the ... ahem.  

Bullying isn't something you're going to be able to fix on your own and by your admission you're already getting picked on, so what's the trouble with hearing aids? If they get after you for that, it's on them, not you, and their lives are all the poorer for thinking it's good fun to pick on others.

I grew up in a farming community and as a result the hearing of every student was checked every year. When 1/2 or more of your student body is exposed to loud farming equipment it doesn’t hurt to check some things and a few students did go deaf, me included even though we weren’t one of the farming families. 

My test was “okay” but it was always recommended I take a more accurate sound proof booth test. My mom passed this off because we weren’t a farming family despite the fact 2 cousins of hers were born deaf. I’ve mostly gotten used to it but you can definitely tell I need hearing aids.

1lew6hi,deaf,Question about how often deaf folks are diagnosed or misdiagnosed as autistic,"Long story short, I’m 45 years old and profoundly deaf but have bilateral cochlear implants. As an infant, according to my mother who is now deceased, drs thought I was autistic. Later, they discovered my hearing loss and thought maybe my less social tendencies were due to being deaf.  People are a lot less interesting to interact with if you can’t hear them or understand them.  I was described as “more than just quiet” in high school, I rarely spoke.  However, in college, I learned ASL and did have a lot more of a social life.  Talked to people more. Went into the medical field. Still talk to people on a daily basis. It’s clear to me that social cues are harder for me.  What’s not clear to me is if it’s just due to growing up deaf, not learning ASL until later and struggling to understand people before that, or if autism could be part of it. Has anyone else struggled with this?  I feel that deaf people are way more vulnerable to being misdiagnosed as autistic because how many neuropsychologists really understand the impact of deafness?  But I also recognize it’s possible that both can coexist. 

[댓글]
Getting evaluated couldn’t hurt but if social cues are your only struggle it might just be the lack of ability to communicate as a kid that messed with you.

On other hand you can have both. I do. (And I won’t tolerate any ableism) 

But of course that requires careful consideration and thorough assessment (as always). I got my diagnosis in my thirties so at least they didn’t mistake anything I did in my childhood to arrive to the diagnosis. It was pretty clear cut if you compare me with deaf peers.

The psychiatric clinic that did the assessment is specialized in deaf patients.

I think this is vital: you gotta compare with other deaf not with hearing or you might get biased in one or other direction.

I work in a school for the Deaf and honestly I feel like our kids who are obviously autistic just don’t get diagnosed as often as hearing kids would if they showed the same characteristics of autism. It blows my mind. Maybe it’s just my school, I don’t know. But so many people just brush it off as “they’re Deaf, they’re just learning to communicate” and it’s like “it can be both.” What the heck

I know of at least two children that were misdiagnosed as autistic, then later found out they weren't autistic, just deaf. It's rare to find psychologists that can do a proper evaluation unless they actually know about deaf tendencies and how it may skew the evaluation.

It's definitely common to see deaf children with some similar traits as autistic people, and it's common to see deaf people grow up with less social skills than their hearing counterparts.

I was undiagnosed autistic, and I think being deaf was a large part of that, along with being a girl in the 90s.

It is hard to extricate one from the other because a lot of things apply to both. A lot of my autistic traits were put down to being deaf and it wasn't until I realised I was autistic that a lot of the things I struggle with aren't only due to being deaf, but are just exacerbated by it. 

Why don't you look more into things about autism that don't have to do with communicating or hearing to try to determine if they apply to you? Things about routine, sensory stuff, coping with change, etc.

Thank you for sharing your story

In high school, I used to volunteer during the summers with an extended school year program for deaf children. We had one little girl, maybe 5 or 6. She had been misdiagnosed as severely autistic, when in fact she was just deaf. Language deprivation had caused her to be extremely delayed. However, at the time I worked with her, she was learning ASL and in the process of being evaluated for hearing aids/CIs. She was very intelligent and picking up ASL very quickly. I can imagine this happened a lot more before newborn hearing screenings became the norm.

It can also happen the other way around. My known deafness actively stopped me from getting diagnosed as autistic in primary school as they couldn't be sure whether it was the deafness or the autism, I still came out of it with a diagnosis of social communication disorder and I'm currently on the lengthy NHS waiting list for an autism assessment.

I had a kid client who was sent to a Deaf camp (I was his 1:1 aide and I’m Deaf w ability to “speak/talk”) and throughout the camp, it was obvious the kid can hear-hear. Turns out his parents refused to come to terms with the kid’s “additional disability”, which is autism and was insistent that the kid was Deaf only. Hard thing. Great kid tho. Absolutely a wonderful kid

Yup. I was, but unrelated to deafness. It only took an unqualified armchair psychologist 5 minutes to diagnose me and it was over just one thing which is sensitive skin. That's it. Apparently hating socks with seam lines = ND. Lots of people hate it too. Inside out seam socks is usually the solution.

Writing on paper or text back and forth don't feel the same with ASL. Nearly all of my friends are Deaf ASL users. So this can't be the case for autism.",2025-06-18 23:41:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lew6hi/question_about_how_often_deaf_folks_are_diagnosed/
1lemqbo,deaf,When is YouTube ACTUALLY going to fix their auto-captions?,"I am so sick of reading [______] in place of every obscene word! It’s so awesome on Reddit that we can actually read their auto cc, where the swear words are fully typed out and not censored!

The whole reason YouTube started this was because dumb people who volunteered to do manual captions for some other content were starting to add little “asides” in the captions- giving their opinions about things or commentary that was NOT being said in the original video.

I think this was like 3-4 years ago that they started this practice and told its users that it was just temporary, and that they were working on getting it fixed.

Tragically, it seems all but forgotten. I pay 13 bucks a month for YouTube Premium (the ads were simply too much and ruin the viewing experience, especially when they show an ad right in the middle of a video!!!!!). As a Deaf viewer I would expect there to be full accessibility, just as I expect it on other streaming platforms, and they certainly don’t censor their captions!!!

It’s so beyond frustrating - does anyone have any idea how we can start a petition or know someone that works for Google/YouTube that could possibly get the ball rolling again to remedy this??

I don’t have an answer but I completely agree. I’m waiting for the day YouTube finally gets sued for not providing equal access.

That’s not an error, that’s intentional. They have to make money on advertising so they have to make captions “family friendly” which means they won’t spell the obscene words for the kids

Glad I'm not the only one that was thinking it was really weird of them to do that in the first place. Would be great if they could revert that like cmon 💀

god i wish but honestly, youtube has the best auto captions alone compared to other services i’ve used. it sucks because i LOVED the community captions until people like markiplier who’s a bigger content creator at the time had fans just putting in whatever they wanted which made him stop doing that along with others. i can understand why they did this because in high school when my only accommodations for cc was auto generated captions and it thinking that what someone said was a cuss word but they were just speaking in another language. *there should be an option to hide obscene words if they come up for educators or parents and for us, to turn it off and be able to make full use of it.*

UGH THIS yes so frustrating  :/

Everytime I get a hold of someone to complain, they tell me to fill out the feedback form.

Apparently deaf people are children who need protection from naughty words 🙄

When enough hearing people bitch about it… and I don’t mean use privilege in a positive way. I just mean when enough people go “I can understand the captions at night when my spouse is sleeping and I can’t have the sound on bc I’ll wake them up that’s SUCH A PROBLEM”

1lelhrz,deaf,Learning only to sign and not to interpret the signs,"I’m gonna vent for a bit now.

My pet peeve is hearing people attempting to learn a few signs to communicate with deaf people but completely forgets to learn the receiving component (how to interpret the signs signed to you)

I feel it is a bit infantilizing/patronizing as if they only want to tell us but not care about our response/our signing?

Imho the skill in actually understanding signs usually is really bad compared with the signing so I actually prefer if people focus more energy on practicing this part than signing as the latter will come naturally somehow if you practice the interpreting part…

A good example of why it works: I often see CODA be like this: very good at interpreting but less good at signing but people don’t care because it is easier to work around that!

Do you agree?

I post this here becuase I don’t want to lock in to ASL only as there’s: oh wait.. more than one sign language and sadly the sign language subreddit is almost dead 

[댓글]
*Both* are necessary to truly be fluent... and, honestly, I'd rather someone work on their *receptive* skills over their *expressive*, because understanding the signer is more important.

That being said, as a late-deafened/HoH person who lives more Deaf-adjacent (rather than part of the Deaf culture), I can tell you that my expressive skills are better than my receptive ones. I grew up hearing, in a hearing family, and in the hearing world... and I still live and work there mostly, despite being deaf/HoH.

The same is true of the high school students I support in their ASL classes. They often find it far easier to learn vocabulary, grammar, positionals, NMMs, etc. than they do *understanding* a Deaf person signing (or fingerspelling) at full speed. We just make sure they practice their receptive skills just as much as their expressives - their grade is split evenly between the two (with a small percentage based on Deaf culture and history knowledge).

Funny enough, though, my 10yo daughter's receptive skills are amazing; I can sign complex instructions to her, and she might need a clarification on a specific sign or two, but then she follows them precisely.

My 13yo son, though... ugh, I dunno if it's his age or what, but he seems completely disinterested in the language. Which is ironic, because he's already showing the symptoms of hearing difficulties common in our family, so he's the one that needs the language *the most*.

Hearing people do this with spoken language, too. They’ll learn just enough to frustrate a native speaker because they’ll ask a question or express something and then not be able to understand the answer. 

To be fair, receptive skills are far harder than expressive and *also* harder to practice on your own. (Again, in both signed and spoken language.) But you’re right that if anyone wants to learn a language to use with other people, this part is necessary.

As a hearing ASL student, receptive was always my problem. I became an interpreter during covid and I just now feel like I'm almost okay at it. 

Like someone else said, you see it a lot in spoken languages too. I think its how the human brain is wired combined with the way languages are taught. You cant learn to understand a word until you can sign (or speak) it yourself. But classes move between vocabulary lessons so quickly, especially if you're learning in a college setting, that you never really get used to seeing or hearing it. 

The solution to that is to practice conversation with native signers/speakers, but thats often easier said than done unless you live somewhere the language is widely used.

Hearing people tend to only see communication as them talking at people and not really understand that it is a two way thing that both are responsible for. 

Listening isn’t just waiting for your turn to speak.

I agree with you 💯

Huh, I guess I’m the weirdo! I have always found receptive skills to be the easier part of language learning and struggle a lot with expressive language! I just assumed others felt the same way!

It's the way languages are learned, generally, you need to know a word before you can recognize it, right? So one tends to come before the other. Secondly, not much time is spent on giving people receptive practice, or discussion on that in class. That should change.

I grew up learning French and being able to hear it was always the absolute hardest part, I didn't always used to be as deaf as I am now, the reason is because the style of French taught in school is way more formal than natural French speaking, so the rhythm, flow, sounds are almost completely different to what you're used to. Very similar with ASL. 

You can only learn what you're being taught.

Both are EQUALLY important for communication. 

If you can only sign to me or I can only sign to you, we aren't communicating.

At this point I'd prefer we write.

I understand more than I can sign now that I'm out of practice. I agree fully that being able to understand the person is more accommodating and useful ( usually) I'm the opposite with Spanish tho..  can say more than I can understand.

This is pretty normal from what I've seen. Luckily I was told very early on to focus on receptive ability over expressive by my mother who is a language teacher (a spoken language) as it's much more important for acquiring a language. It's the same with spoken languages as well and it's how we acquire our native language. When I practice it's about a 90/10 split in favour of receptive. Once I can understand stuff then I can sign it better myself so the expressive skills follow from watching fluent people. I know some students in class who could sign very fast (i.e fingerspelling and basics) and looked impressive early on (at least to other students haha, probably not to teachers) but nearly three years later can't understand much of what we are taught and are really behind now as a result plus now don't have the expressive skills to communicate beyond basic stuff. I think to learn any language it's good to look into language learning strategies rather than just wing it as well, but most people don't.",2025-06-18 16:25:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lelhrz/learning_only_to_sign_and_not_to_interpret_the/
1leg3no,deaf,is it ok to say Im deaf in public when im hearing (united states),"I am fully hearing but I do know asl and use it to communicate frequently, and it's my preferred method of communication. I was wondering if it's ok to say I'm deaf when in public because I am a bit antisocial but I like using ASL to speak. For example I was wondering if it is ok for me to walk into a store and say I am deaf so people don't talk to me, I feel like an a**hole if I were to do that because it would be a lie.

&gt; I like using ASL to speak.

Well, this is your communication preference, so I'd just say it openly and honestly like this (using ASL and / or speech), rather than lying.

&gt; because I am a bit antisocial

No, lying about being deaf makes you VERY anti-social. You're making it worse for the rest of us. Yes, you'd be an asshole not just for lying but for misrepresenting a huge population of other people. 

You hear people then respond to them telling them you're deaf. That  puts a very bad world view in their mind if they believe you. You might be the only ""deaf"" person they've ever knowingly encountered.  (we're everywhere but hearing people don't notice). Real deaf people don't reply with ""I'm deaf"" because we don't fucking hear them in the first place. When people realize you're lying they're going to first assume that anyone that says they're deaf is probably lying. People get assaulted over this kind of shit.

faking a disability is generally frowned upon but i dont care what you do.

I’d say no it’s not ok to say you are deaf even if ASL is your preffered way to communicate don’t lie about that there is no reason to.

1lefdvv,deaf,Deaf on my right ear and I have tinnitus on my left one,"I'm deaf on one air while I also have tinnitus on the one I can hear. It's been like that my whole life. I've been to doctors, done everything but nothing helps. They told me I'll probably have to live with it. It is extremely difficult to engage in conversations or even hear someone say something because not only do I not hear on my right eat but I have constant beeping sound on my left one. Is there anything that can help out a little? (Lucky enough to get the worst combo ever heh)

Hi! I lost my hearing on my right side when I was 32, and I also suffer from tinnitus, so I know it’s really hard.

There absolutely are multiple things that can be done, and you should start by trying to establish what caused your hearing loss. In the UK one of the most common causes of single sided deafness is acoustic neuroma, which is a benign tumour on your auditory nerve. These can be surgically removed and many people report improvements for tinnitus with this surgery.

I use a bone conductive hearing aid which attaches to my skull and transmits sound to my hearing side through the bones. I can even connect the sound processor to the TV and my phone. It doesn’t give me 360 degree hearing but it really helps.

Hearing therapists can help you learn to live with the tinnitus and other difficulties that you might be experiencing. In the UK I’d direct you to the RNID; hopefully you have something similar where you live? 

Above all, you don’t have to tolerate being brushed off. I lost count of the number of people who told me stuff like “never mind, you still have another ear” and it’s just such bullshit. You wouldn’t say it to someone with one arm, would you? Some people cope fine with one ear; some don’t - but you deserve to get the help you need. 

Message me if I can help at all.

Talk to a doctor, maybe find a new primary care doctor. Get a full health assessment, especially things like blood pressure. Both too high and too low can exacerbate tinnitus. 


Tinnitus usually stems from some kind of damage or anomaly with the ear, so protecting the hearing you have is important. Your good ear with the tinnitus might not otherwise typically get a hearing aid, but talk to an audiologist or several, (ironically it's hard to give an audiologist that actually listens). Hearing aids can stimulate the ear and satisfy the some of the root cause. 


Finally, see if you can talk to a psychologist as well. Tinnitus starts in the ear but it's really in the brain. In my personal experience the best way to end a temporary bout of tinnitus is to ignore it. Yes, I know that seems impossible sometimes, it's like when someone tells you not to think about the elephant and then that's all you can think about. A combination of music or white noise and meditation might offer you some relief.


Good luck!


EDIT: a word, I'm on mobile.

I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and am hard-of-hearing in my left and have had tinnitus for as long as I can remember. The tinnitus suuuuuucks so much. Mine is normally just a steady buzzing noise, but sometimes, it'll crank up with a louder beeping sound or even the pulsatile tinnitus that sounds like a steady ""womp-womp"" sound from an uneven washing machine. 

About a year and a half ago, I got an Oticon hearing aid. It's a BiCros, so there's a mic on my right side and the hearing aid/receiver on the left. When I'm wearing that, the tinnitus isn't quite as loud/annoying. At night, I sleep with a white noise machine to sort of even it out so I can sleep. Without it, I just get to listen to the most annoying sound till exhaustion finally gives me relief. 

When the audiologist said that I needed the hearing aid (which, y'know, I already knew), she told me that there was a chance it would help with the tinnitus, but not a guarantee. Even if you don't get a BiCros, you should ask about it with your doctor/audiologist. Even a single-side hearing aid might help.

I'm allowing this particular post, but we don't normally allow questions for medical advice. I feel that this post is outside to the intent of the rule.",2025-06-18 12:07:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1lefdvv/deaf_on_my_right_ear_and_i_have_tinnitus_on_my/
1ldxw5a,deaf,Hard of hearing child  being accepted into early intervention care program by the state,"As stated in the title, I have a 3 month old baby and he was just diagnosed hard of hearing (mild to moderately severe hearing loss) bilateral sensorial hearing loss. 
I have 2 children born this way because I have a genetic collagen disorder that affects the ears, eyes, skeletal frame and heart
 
Someone from health services contacted me and said that my state (TN) offers early intervention for deaf/hard of hearing children 
And asked if I wanted to sign up for it 

Does anyone have kids that went through an early intervention program ? And what did they do? 
He hits all his reg milestones 
He babbles, smiles and tries to lift his head. 

He’s supposed to get hearing aids but my insurance doesn’t cover the molds and the intervention program ppl told me they offer hearing devices 
They did let me know I didn’t have to sign up for it but I decided to do it even though idk how they are going to be able to help a newborn. They didn’t offer this to my oldest but she didnt get hearing aids until she was 4 so she was just seeing a audiologist and ENT. Has a IEP but wasn’t in a early intervention program offered by the state  

Can someone please educate me on this and what to expect. Can they help him even though he is a baby? 

[댓글]
Yes! My HOH baby has received early intervention services since he was about 3 months. He receives audiology services and SLP services, and we also have a Deaf mentor, all through the early intervention program. In our state, all DHH babies are automatically eligible for services from birth, since they are at higher risk for language deprivation/delays when they have hearing parents who don't know a signed language (which is most DHH kids, including mine!)

Our SLP visits monthly, and her services are mostly about offering us tips to support language development (both spoken language and ASL), as well as answering questions about his hearing aids, etc. She also visits our son at daycare monthly, and similarly offers suggestions/education to his teachers. Some of her tips are useful for all kids (like encouraging us to wait after asking a question to give him a chance to respond), but others are a little more specific to DHH kids (like encouraging us to wait for him to look at us before talking to him). Our son has been meeting all milestones, but if there is ever a concern, we can increase the frequency of her visits. Our Deaf mentor also visits us at home monthly and is helping us learn ASL as well as teaching us about Deaf culture.

I recommend at least giving the services a try! If you're not finding them useful, you can always stop.

Early intervention is very important for deaf/hh kids! They will at a minimum do testing every 6 months to make sure he is hitting language milestones, and will also provide services like occupational therapy, audiology, etc as needed. 

(Early intervention services cover 0-3 year olds, often referred to as ""Part C"" because it's Part C of a federal act. At 3 the kids age into the school system or ""Part B"" of the same act, which is supposed to collaborate with Part C services on the transition.)

At 3 months old - if the early intervention is using sign language to the baby, then 100% do it. But I’m going to take an educated guess and say this state funded early intervention has nothing to do with ASL.

You have older children so it seems like you know what your plan is but my recommendation for all deaf children and babies (and parents) is to learn ASL. The rest is nowhere near as helpful and can even be harmful.

The answer to your question is probably very specific to that state and program as to what their interventions actually are.

I'll chime in with our experience with EI as well, although you've already gotten good feedback. Some of this may be more for a first time parent, but thought it would be good to list it out. We had a good experience with EI, I would recommend trying it out. You can advocate for a TOD (teacher of the deaf) to be part of your plan, which can help support language acquisition with ASL. We also got an educational audiologist into our plan, I think it was 2x/quarter, to meet with the daycare teachers and do an in service with them, remind them about teaching strategies etc. We had services from an SLP who specializes in supporting deaf children. Through EI we were also connected with other families, events, and services across the state. 

The last piece is one of the biggest values we got, which was in the support for the transition to public school. Our team supported us through the special education evaluation, helped us understand what to expect, and gave us resources to help us advocate for our child.

My children both went through early intervention. It covers all hearing aids, molds, and audiologist appointments until 3. Gave us a deaf mentor who taught me and my husband sign. Listening and spoken language therapy from 6 months-3.

I just enrolled my little one for hearing loss, too. Not sure what to expect but I’ve known other families to sing the praises of TEIS.

And what's truly terrifying is that, whether we like it or not, so much of the world follows America's lead on stuff like this. There's a cultural dominance through American media that has to be acknowledged. Same thread runs through corporations and businesses worldwide.

We are not exactly on people's minds all that much at the best of times. Now? Who wants to bet against Sign Language programs being labeled as ""Woke DEI"" initiatives?

This is just sickening and quite sad to witness…

Schools for the Deaf barely have money since 2000s. Many used to have pools, facilities and so forth but they have been abandoned and shutdown after 2000s.

Only decent ones are in wealthy suburban districts as their funding is pooled in with the entire school district funding.

This is very sad. Project 2025 warned us of this and many ignored that.

1ldn9gi,deaf,Hello from Korea: I’m Deaf but neither a speaker nor a signer—does anyone relate?,"Dear fellow deaf and hard of hearing friends,

Today, I just joined Reddit and wanted to say hello. I was born deaf with a congenital hearing loss of 100 decibels, and I cannot speak clearly or hear. 

I have hearing parents, so I learned to speak when I was a child and entered the hearing world—an extremely rare case. However, that doesn’t mean I can communicate effectively with hearing people using spoken language.

In Korea, being deaf means you either use sign language or are able to communicate. There is no such thing as someone in between—not able to communicate through speech and also not fluent in sign language. In fact, there isn't even a word in the Korean language to describe someone like me. 

In English-speaking countries, because of a cultural atmosphere that respects individual freedom and opinions, people with diverse identities are acknowledged and respected. I envy that!

In Korea, we went through a long period of authoritarian rule, so the history of democratization is still relatively short. 

As a result, society tends to be very uniform. (It’s hard to live here—the birth rate is the lowest in the world! 🤣) Since there's no proper word for someone like me, I’m not sure what to call myself.

 In English-speaking countries, people like me are sometimes referred to as “HOH” (Hard of Hearing). Is that the right term?

Throughout my life, I’ve never been able to communicate with others. From elementary school all the way through university, I never had a conversation with a friend. 

In Korea, other deaf people with hearing loss as severe as mine usually learn sign language and become part of the signing Deaf (Deaf with a capital D) community. 

But I feel like I’m the only one here who cannot communicate verbally and yet is not a signer.

Deaf people here often say I’m not “really” deaf just because I went to a mainstream school. Even though I couldn’t talk to anyone at all during those years, they say I haven’t experienced the “true pain” of being deaf because I don’t use sign language. Their words have deeply hurt me.

I’d love to connect and have conversations with deaf people around the world! Nice to meet you all!

I was born in Sri Lanka and I have had similar experiences to you. I became deaf at the age of two. My grandmother was visiting Canada at that time and she learned a short course on speech therapy in Canada and returned home to work together to give me speech therapy.

Back then if you become deaf, you would go to a ""Special School"" for Deaf (They called it Deaf and Mute back then too). There you would learn sign language and have education till secondary school. Then the deaf child would either go to trade school (very common choice) or mainstream school for high school (very rare). Mainstream schools and universities weren't accessible either. I heard many things have changed in Sri Lanka now. I went to a mainstream school back then. I had almost no exposure to DHH communities. So I had no identity and I was just ""hearing impaired"" and ""different and below normal person"" in terms of my identity.

Even after moving to Canada at the age of 19-ish, my exposure to DHH communities was so limited. When I moved to British Columbia (a province in Canada), I found my first HoH friends and enjoyed the new life and community. I still felt not fully belonged to HOH communities because my speech, accent, and stuff made me feel different. 

Then someone introduced me to the Deaf community and I learned sign language (and still learning). I may not be ""Deaf"" enough for some folks. There always will be some elitists in any community. Don't listen to them. Don't let everyone define who you are.

My previous therapist, who is Deaf, said deaf identity is a spectrum. Take your time. Keep exploring. Don't let everyone define you. My exploration began about 5 years ago and I haven't stopped. Learn sign language and get into Deaf events. It still isn't late.

I just go with Orally Deaf or just ""deaf"". I am glad to be stuck between both HoH and the Deaf world now.

Why can’t you learn sign?

Hello,

I am pretty much deaf as well… but my story is a bit different…

I’m a 61yo male from Florida, USA.  I lost my hearing suddenly over night in 2007 due to a rare autoimmune issue called Cogan’s Syndrome. My sudden hearing loss was profound and has continued to get worse over the years and now I am basically deaf. In the USA it is also called “hearing impaired” for the most part which reflects all levels of hearing loss from mild to profound. 

Just like you, I have not learned to use sign language. Rather, I wear the most powerful hearing aids I can find to hear some sound and try to lip read. I am mildly successful with this at best. 

To say it is challenging to get through life is an understatement. I encounter people all the time who are very understanding and try to really help me with communication and then there are others that are visibly upset having to repeat themselves or to even try to understand my deafness.

I try not to let the latter group affect me in anyway and brush it off as their issue and not mine but that is so much easier said than done at times. 

Nevertheless, I try to stay positive and focus on trying to still live my best life despite my physical shortcomings and my inability to connect with others like I used to.  

Bottom line, you are not alone. There are many of us around the world who share similar situations. 

So when you are feeling down reach out to others like yourself and it will most likely provide you with some peace and solace.

Best to you and stay positive as best as you can.

I’m Dutch, but I totally recognize what you write. I have profound hearing loss in my left ear and ~80dB in my right ear. I never learned sign and I can speak clearly therefore nobody understands my hearing loss. I never use any kind of accommodation besides my hearing aid because people expect me to get by. However, I still miss out on much, because lipreading is not perfect in certain situations (eg when you miss the first part until you see who is talking, people standing far away, group conversations where switching between people goes too quickly)

Im hard of hearing and can relate to your story. I was born with hearing loss and was raised mainstream. I come from an Italian family who immigrated to the USA but the audiologist encouraged my family to keep me from learning Italian so I could focus on English.

I grew up with bullying and isolation and never being hearing enough in school. I learned to sign in in my early 20s though I still struggled with not being Deaf enough since I could speak. It’s an isolating experience and I feel for you. Just know there’s a lot of us around the world and I see you. We need a group chat or something!

I was and still occasionally get identified as stuck between Deaf and Hearing “Worlds” based on my ability to speak but I’m Deaf. 

I feel you and wanted to encourage you to be continually proactive like you are now in finding people who you’re comfortable with you and your identity.

Hello from America. I am HoH. I was born deaf in my left ear when my mom got very sick with the measles and as a result, I was horn with Congenital Rubella Syndrome. I had some trouble growing up but managed to get by. The. Last year I found out I had mixed hearing loss in my right ear and now wear hearing aids. I cried hearing sound in my left ear. I was shocking bc I never thought I'd hear in that ear. I never learned sign but use a little bc my middle child, whole hearing and no deaf, sometimes can't think of words. She is special needs and didn't talk until she was 7. So I had to use a little bit of sign just to see if she'd use some. She does but also has trouble using her hands its hard for her to do signs sometimes. 

I have not been to Korea but did almost move to South Korea when I was 7 I think. My step dad works on helicopters as a mechanic and had a job offer. But my mom didn't want me so far from my dad. Honestly I think it would have been an interesting experience. I'd definitely be an outsider though.

I hope you can learn more sign language so you can talk to people. And I have heard the the Deaf community can be very picky about who is considered part of the community. I dont think they're all like that though. But I can't speak for the people where you are. It is nice to meet you. Meeting others definitely makes things a little easier.

Hello there dropping a hi. I can somewhat related but Im not mute. However I don't sign and I cannot hear that well when people speak. Welcome!

1ldlt7c,deaf,From korea!,"Hello. I am a hearing-impaired person in Korea. My hearing is 100 decibels, so I cannot communicate. Even so, I have lived in the general society (hearing society).

In Korea, hearing-impaired people are largely divided into two types.

Hearing-impaired people who use Korean Sign Language (Deaf/농인), and hearing-impaired people who can communicate vocally with the help of hearing aids or cochlear implants (oralist/구화인).

But I’m someone who doesn’t quite belong to either side.

I could not attend a special school, so I am not recognized as Deaf by Deaf people. Living is not easy.

In Korea, I cannot find a 'border person' like me. I joined Reddit because I want to find people like me.

Nice to meet you! 🇰🇷

Based on your description, I am a border person too.

These days, I am deaf due to a damaged ear bone (implant didn’t work), but I would say I grew up as a border person.  Having one foot in each world but not planted firmly enough on either side for those in those two worlds to fully understand or accept me (though I always found it easier to blend in with the dead/HOH world).",2025-06-17 12:27:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ldlt7c/from_korea/
1ldfngr,deaf,Does the use of the🧏‍♂️ emoji to portray mewing aggravate y’all?,"Recently, I have noted “🤫🧏‍♂️” used by (presumably) Gen Alpha to portray mewing. Does this co-opting of the “deaf man” emoji for something so… *I’m at a loss for adjectives.* Does it bother y’all?

[댓글]
As a millennial… I have never felt so old. What the heck is “mewing?” I assume it has some other meaning other than the noises a kitten makes.

That being said. I doubt anyone cares how an emoji is or isn’t being used.

I don’t care x3.  Emojis don’t belong to anyone in particular and part of their magic is their flexibility.  

If people want to aubergine around or be peach heads that’s up to them. 

PS That emoji you showed in the title means hearing in my national sign language (BSL). It may mean different things in other sign languages.

What the flying fuck is mewing and who is using the deaf emoji to portray it? What? This is news to me. Whatever it is sounds like run of the mill hearing kid insensitivity. Nothing remarkable.

The only thing that pisses me off is how stupid the word “mewing” sounds

Honestly, I don't mind it too much. Emojis are used all the time outside of their original meaning, like the eggplant or peach emojis. I don't recall a single instance where those emojis were used outside of their sexual connotations.

If anything, some people might learn that the emoji actually stands for ""deaf"" which increases awareness of that sign, and I think that's ultimately a good thing - to increase awareness that deafness exists.

But ultimately, its use doesn't bother me, and I believe time is better spent in deaf advocacy towards more important issues, including but not limited to interpreter access, deaf education, healthcare, and so forth. But I am just one person and that's my take on it.

Ugh such a dumb trend lol.

I just get annoyed when I see someone has it in their bio (social games, discord, etc.) and I approach them all excited that I've found a potential new deaf friend in the wild and then they make *me* feel silly for thinking the emoji means they're deaf instead of ""mewing""

They’re insufferable.

🙏 &lt;- this was supposed to be a high five, not praying. like someone else said, that’s the beauty of using emojis is its flexibility.

I didn't know mewing had emojis. I wonder if my son knows. Of course, he'll roll his eyes and say something like, ""I hate my generation."" Apparently a lot of the slang and terms his gen uses bothers him a lot. Lol I've never seen someone as bothered by people his age as much as him. I'm gen x and he says he'd rather be that. I'm not sure his thoughts on millennials. He doesn't know many. Except a few teachers. And THAT makes me feel old bc I'm older than his teachers. Whispers, ""And that feels strange as hell.""

Personally yes a bit but I can’t help but agree with others that emojis are somewhat subjective. People will do what people will do and nothing will change so just have to not care 🤷‍♂️.

yeah it does for some reason but it's honestly a nothing burger so i just keep silent

I don't care

1ldb2f3,deaf,2.5 year old with behavior problems,"I know of “terrible twos” and this could be unrelated to being deaf but my son has been like this for almost a year. He is bilaterally deaf with cochlear implants. I’m his mom and he lives with me, his dad, 9 year old sister, and 13-month old brother. We are all hearing besides him. We all are still learning sign and try to use it as much as possible but we are still beginners. 

My 2.5 year old is horrible to his younger brother. He is constantly biting him, pushing him, hitting him, and will laugh at him in pain. He will scream in his younger brother’s face until his brother cries. He enjoys it when his brother cries. This doesn’t seem normal and comes out of no where. My 2.5 year old will be insanely sweet then starts acting like that. He throws the most insane fits. There are many times when he doesn’t even sign or try to verbalize what he wants. He just goes straight to yelling or throwing himself on the floor and crying. He is so determined once he has his mind set on something. He is honestly miserable to be around a lot of the time and I just want to help him. 

I know that hearing with his implants can make him more tired/overwhelmed. He lets us know when he wants them off or on and we respect what he prefers. 

I really don’t even know what advice I’m looking for. I’m just worried he feels left out or something but I don’t know. I love him so much and I just want what’s best for him.  ",2025-06-17 01:50:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ldb2f3/25_year_old_with_behavior_problems/

Thought experiment: Imagine a button. Push it and you have 100% perfect hearing and are perfectly healthy in all ways. But your body is now of the opposite gender. And you cannot do anything to get back to your original gender, so your new body is what you'd stick with for the rest of the life. Would you go ahead with this?

1laf6ni,deaf,Am I overstepping as a hearing person? 2 questions:,"Hi all,

I'm looking for advice from the Deaf community about hearing people using ""ASL"". For some context, I am trying to get into an ASL interpreting program either this year or next year, and have been learning ASL through immersion for almost 15 years (definitely not fluent, but quite conversational).

I am working at a summer camp that my partner has attended/been a part of for almost 20 years. It is a hearing camp, but there is a history of it partly being a Deaf camp from yeaaars ago. Last night, they were singing around the campfire and brought up a song that has ""hand motions"" and is from the time of when they had Deaf involvement at the camp. Although they described it as ASL, it's SEE **at best.** Just some words of the song have signs along with it, and a lot of the signs are incorrect due to it being passed on over generations of the camp through hearing people that don't know ASL or signs.

I felt very weird about the whole situation. It felt wrong. I feel like the obvious answer is to bring it up to them and suggest that if there isn't a continuous Deaf influence, maybe it shouldn't be sung with the signs. I'm conflicted because from the camp perspective, I don't want to overstep in a communal camp tradition. But from a person who knows a bit about Deaf culture but not fully, obviously, I don't know if it's my place to judge what's right and wrong.

I guess I'm wondering if it's appropriate to lightly educate them on the correct signs for the words, explain that it's more SEE, not ASL, ask them not to refer to it as ""hand motions"" (or encourage them to use just dance moves instead), and expand upon the accessibility of ASL communication? I do think learning ASL is important and should be more widespread, but it's obviously not my place to teach it?

In a similar vein, and maybe I already answered the question myself, but counselors here have the ability to teach 3, hour-long classes to the kids. I did think it might be neat to teach basic, conversational signs (alphabet, YOUR NAME WHAT?, WATER? PLEASE, BATHROOM WHERE?, etc) to the kids so they can 1. communicate with Deaf people in the community and 2. maybe get curious to learn more ASL in a better setting. Do you guys think that is not appropriate because I'm not fully fluent as a hearing person or Deaf?

[댓글]
People might disagree with me and downvote this comment… but I wanted to share a bit about teaching ASL signs at camp.

For me, I was raised as an oral deaf/hh person (only deaf person in my hearing family). My mom tried to sign with me when I was really little, but that fell by the wayside and I forgot that ASL existed as I grew older. I remember being excited when one of my camp counselors was teaching ASL signs. I signed up for it cause I was curious. She taught the very basics : fingerspelling, colors, needs like what you were describing…etc. She emphasized that it’s better to learn from a native signer… but this was an exposure that was pivotal for me. I sought ASL classes at the local community college while in HS and then decided to continue to study it while in college. I now teach and work at a School for the Deaf. I am involved in a vibrant and inclusive community that I wouldn’t give up for the world.

Soooo, the camp no longer includes Deaf people or intentionally centers Deaf culture, but they’re still using hand motions they *think* are ASL? I understand why that feels off to you. ASL is not just a set of gestures; it’s a full language deeply tied to a culture and community. When hearing people pass down inaccurate signs or treat them like “hand motions,” it can feel like cultural appropriation, even if that isn’t the intent.

It really depends on your role at camp. Since you’re aware of the issue and care about doing right by the Deaf community, you could frame it as a fun and respectful learning opportunity. For example, you could offer to lead a short activity where you teach the correct ASL signs for a few key concepts or lyrics, while clearly explaining that you are hearing, still learning, and that ASL belongs to the Deaf community. This transparency is important to set the right tone.

But here’s the bigger point: If the camp truly values honoring its history of Deaf involvement, why not go beyond just fixing a song? They could invite Deaf staff, consultants, or community members to join, advise, or lead programs. Even one or two Deaf staffers could make a huge positive impact. That way, Deaf culture isn’t reduced to a campfire song; it becomes part of the camp community again.

As for teaching ASL basics: It’s wonderful that you want to inspire kids to learn. A hearing person who is still learning can model respectful curiosity, but it’s crucial to frame it that way. “I’m learning too, and here’s what I can share so far.” It would be even better to advocate for bringing in Deaf instructors if possible. Maybe that could be part of your legacy at camp: helping them reconnect with the Deaf community in an authentic way.   
Deaf children have a hard enough time finding their own camp, one that is fully accessible. I know. I run one of them in two separate states...and when people find out about our camp, they are in shock how long it's been around, even though we advertise everywhere possible (I'm beginning to doubt my advertising skills).

I'm curious why no more Deaf come. However, you’re asking the right questions. Keep centering Deaf voices, and you’re on the right path.

I definitely feel that since the people you are trying to educate are hearing - it’s very appropriate. If it were a group of Deaf people skilled in ASL, it’s never appropriate to correct them. Share the alternative sign you learned or ask them why they are using what they are using but definitely avoid correcting them. But like I said, since it’s a group of hearing people please, by all means do. Allyship is awesome and it helps to eliminate some of the incorrect information/signs/ideas being passed around.

1laeoa5,deaf,Hearing aid batteries - should I post this in r/hardofhearing instead?,"Hello,

So I use power hearing aids. I just ran out of one year's worth of batteries, so I ordered more. I was surprised to find out that I had child-resistant packaging. Is that the new norm for hearing aid batteries now? If so, shoot me now.

[댓글]
There was a law passed called Reese's Law that requires the child-resistant packaging to avoid children swallowing the button batteries, so yep, this is the standard now.

I accidentally swallowed mine last year (I was supposed to take the tablet in my OTHER hand). How embarrassing.

I’m in Australia and we don’t have child proof batteries yet for the small ones but the coin batteries are all in tricky packaging.

It would be a nightmare for elderly people with poor hand mobility.

There’s so many posts like this in r/hearingaids. It has been almost a year with this packaging and people are still getting surprised by it.

Yup.  It’s idiotic.  The law was passed because of button batteries like those you find in toys.  I haven’t heard of an incident with hearing aid batteries and children.  Hearing aid batteries just aren’t that common, and they aren’t packaged the way button batteries are anyway.

I’ve bought a bunch of discounted packs of batteries with the old packaging.  When I get a new package, I put the batteries in an old one.  I’m not carrying big strong scissors in my purse all the time.

Also, the new packages are actually more dangerous for me.  It’s hard to cut them and pull them open without risking the battery going flying.  I never drop my hearing aid batteries, but now I have to be extremely cautious because dropping one on the floor is how to poison a puppy.

TIL there is a child proof packaging for hearing aids.


I'm from Europe though. Did I understand that right that you have to cut them open using a scissor and not by opening the gaps on the back?

Yup. Last time I ordered a box it even came with a little flier saying they were legally mandated to do that. PITA; I ended up buying a case to and emptying a bunch of packs at once so I can actually get to the batteries when I need them.

2024 and 2025 manufactured batteries would be childproof. You may find pre law manufactured batteries in stores that aren’t child proof

This is new information for me! Well, to be fair, I don’t wear my hearing aid on a regular basis, and my hearing aid is like 10 years old. The batteries I buy are size 13 that I just get from my local grocery store, and those aren’t child-resistant packaging at all.

It’s the new norm. It really sucks because of my low motor function in my hands, makes it so hard to open the packaging now. 

One trick I’ve found useful is using scissors, not to cut but, to wedge open the opening for the battery. Cutting those things is pretty useless because it’s practically impossible to cut through it.",2025-06-13 12:28:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1laeoa5/hearing_aid_batteries_should_i_post_this_in/

   * Transparency requirements? Who is using and benefiting from the research?
   * Should we require some kind of compensation for participants? ($5 gift cards for coffee, etc)
   * In the past we sent out a Google Form for those wanting to do research to filter out the requests and streamline the approval process. We can maybe tweak the questions and resume doing this.
* Rule # 3. We get a ton of posts regarding ideas for assistive technology. These typically have good intentions and are profit driven. Many of the ideas are not as original as thought, aren't actually useful to deaf people, or not needed if things were made to be accessible to begin with.
   * Should there be a place for this? If so, where?
* Rule # 5. No ""how do deaf people think"" posts. WE GET A LOT OF THESE and it's very overwhelming and taxing on the community. Hearing people are welcome here but remember that this is a deaf space.
   * Again, r/askdeaf is there for this. We are not affiliated in any way.
* Rule # 7. Don't post sign language questions here. I know this may seem silly at first but remember this is a worldwide community. There are many different sign languages and it's not universal. This isn't the right place to post ASL questions or ask for free help with your homework. Generalized questions can be asked but most should be directed to their own specific subreddits such as r/asl, r/auslan, r/BSL, etc. The automod bot will flag the few sign language posts that would allow so please let us know.
* Rule # 9 No lipreading requests. WE GET A LOT OF THESE. Most are low effort and from hearing people outside the community. Lipreading is not perfect and not every deaf people can, it's a tool that is used in combination with other context clues. We don't exist to serve hearing people. At least offer some form of compensation.

**Additionally, I want to take a moment to mention the other pertinent subreddits. We are not affiliated with any of these. In no specific order. If I forgot any, it was not intentional.**

* r/AskDeaf
* r/hardofhearing
* r/ASL
* r/auslan
* r/BSL
* r/HearingAids
* r/Cochlearimplants
* r/disability
* r/Disability_Survey
* r/AskAudiology
* r/MonoHearing 

**My personal thoughts and opinions on Reddit moderation in general.**

* It's time consuming. We are volunteers spread across multiple time zones to try to get the most coverage.
* We the moderators are humans and don't always agree exactly but trust each other to make a decision in good faith. We do have a group chat to discuss things that need to be escalated or evaluated further.
* We want to be consistent with rules and enforcement. Please don't feel slighted if we aren't always consistent. Please reach out to us. We have allowed removed posts and unbanned members after additional review.
* Reddit moderation tools suck and are not intuitive. It's easy to miss a message or forget to follow up. The automod will also take actions that we are not aware of unless we dig through the moderation log.
* The rules list doesn't match the moderation responses list. We need to fix this.
* I haven't had the time to learn how to program and tune the automod bot yet. It was configured years ago by people that are no longer active.
* The FAQ is really old and made by people that aren't active members anymore.

**Online chat.**

* There is a Discord server listed in the description. The Discord server is run by a completely different team and not officially affiliated with us. The invite link is here: [https://discord.gg/ae8T8pG](https://discord.gg/ae8T8pG)
* There is an official Reddit Community Chat for r/deaf. You can find it in the ""Community Chat Channels"" section of this subreddit. It's seldomly used but it was created by request from the community.

**Lastly, we need your help!**

* If you want to volunteer, please let us know. We need more moderators!
* What can we do to make this place better?
* Should we have regular online events?
* Should we have a designated day for self-promotions?
* Should we have a designated day for research/survey requests?
* Should we allow AMAs? I've only seen one request so far and I honestly didn't know if we should allow it or not.
* Should we allow posts from hearing people about dating advice? We get a lot, and they are well intentioned, but they can usually be answered in two ways. 1) Ask your partner what their preferred method of communication is. 2) Talk to your partner.
* Should there be a public moderation log? I've seen other communities do this and it's nice, but it requires a lot of effort on the moderators to do this.

Is there a way to differentiate Deaf/HH from APD, going ""nonverbal"" from autism or other issues, and things like this?

Also, is there a possibility of marking some posts for ""Deaf only"" or other groups like that?

I've asked a few questions or posts asking for deaf responses and they get bombarded by mostly hearing and HH replies and experiences. 

Sometimes that doesn't bother me, as a HH has a much closer experience to me than someone hearing, but someone HH (depending where they are on the spectrum) may have a totally different experience which sometimes makes my experience feel invalidated. 

Also, the posts speaking for deaf/HH I feel should more closely monitored.

Sorry if this is bad or inappropriate opinions.

I don't know much about the mechanics of reddit or post moderation, but I have long wished this sub could implement something like I once saw in a Facebook group:

Anyone can post, but for the first 24 hours of the post being live, only d/Deaf/HOH users (possibly self-identified by flair?) can respond.

Again, don't know of the feasibility, but one of the frustrations I have here in particular is how hearing learners or people with no association to a single Deaf person jump in and over-speak those with lived experience, or lead downvote brigades against Deaf voices.

Anything that could curtail the tsunami wave of hearing fragility seems well worth it to me.

I see a few comments regarding flair. It looks like there is a way to make setting a user flair mandatory before posting. I will wait for concurrence with the other mods.

I suddenly went deaf in my left ear last summer and r/monohearing has been what feels like the only real bastion for my community but it is not a large one. That said I'll check out some of the other subs you have listed and look for more broad HoH posts and such.

For #1, can we require IRB approval (or similar)?

Reduce gatekeepers if you can, I feel rather bullied and attacked sometimes by members of this group because I cannot sign ( i physically can’t) nor do I need to and the community needs to accept that not ever deaf person needs sign, we’re all deaf, we all face adversity and problems, we don’t need to create more within the community or ostracise deaf people for something they can’t do

Just add deaf events

In general, I’d like to see the FAQ turned into a pinned post. Whenever I need to reference it, I search the comments for the modbot. I think we should go through the FAQ just to make sure it’s up to date. That’s kind of a side issue from this post.

I have an observation, I’m not sure if it’s a problem. r/asl gets a lot of Deaf culture questions that could be fielded here. I think it’s because of rule 7. Is it a good idea to amend rule 7 to no questions about specific sign languages? 

To the list of subs, there is r/podc for parents of Deaf kids.

I’m willing to help moderate!

In terms of making this space better, I’m curious: what’s the group’s main goal or intention? Is the idea to create a safe space specifically for Deaf people? And if so, what does that *really* mean in practice?

A designated day for self-promotion? If it’s for Deaf-run businesses, I say absolutely YES — we need to uplift and highlight Deaf-led spaces!

As for research and surveys — I’d be supportive if they’re coming from Deaf students. But if it’s hearing students just looking for easy responses from people they’ve never met (instead of engaging face-to-face), I’d lean toward no.

I also don’t see this group as a place for dating advice. If someone wants advice about their date, maybe they should ask their date directly. I don’t think we need AITA-style posts because someone didn’t communicate well with a Deaf or hard-of-hearing person.

And one quick question: when you mention a *moderation log* — what exactly does that mean for this group?

I’m mostly concerned about the implementation of rules (or lack thereof) that inadvertently stiffle or kill the sub. 

Subs much larger than r/deaf have died out.

For this reason, I’m against any rule that excludes non-Deaf people in any way. Their discourse not only boosts the sub’s visibility, it has the potential to encourage positive interaction between Deaf and hearing people (because exclusion is not known to build bridges).

Of course, delete posts and comments that are actually inflammatory and ban users that attack and degrade. But instead of turning away dissenting opinions, we should encourage healthy argument, so that people can be educated better.

You are doing great, I don't think there needs to be mod log or anything, yeah maybe make how to date someone Deaf an askdeaf problem too, but they don't bother me too much

I would IMMEDIATELY stop promoting the Deaf discord server.

**Miriam Garlo: ""Learning sign language at 30 was like starting to see the world in color, the brain is placed in a place of happiness""**

""More than a reference, I am representative,"" says the actress, protagonist of the film 'Sorda'. The film has been directed by her sister, Eva Libertad, and has just been the winner at the Malaga Festival, in which Garlo has been awarded as best female performance

When Miriam Garlo (Murcia, 40 years old) began to think about being a mother, she had all the fears that can come to any woman who is considering taking the step and some more because, in her case, it would be ""being a deaf mother in a hearing society."" She shared it with her sister, director [Eva Libertad](https://elpais.com/cultura/2025-02-15/sorda-la-pelicula-espanola-que-lucha-contra-los-topicos-de-la-sordera-y-ha-emocionado-en-berlin.html), and she suggested that she put them in writing and when she read the two pages of fears and possibilities (""If she is born deaf, if she is born a listener...""), the filmmaker saw there a story to tell. ""That list became the dramatic heart of the short film,"" explains Libertad about the short film *Deaf,* which premiered in 2021 and, after a few initial months, started a journey of festivals and international awards and presented them with an experience, working together, who felt the need to expand. Four years later, last February, they presented the feature film *Deaf* at the [Berlin International Film Festival](https://elpais.com/noticias/festival-berlin/)*,* between listening and non-listening audiences, and in addition to being full of good comments, they left with an award. Very good feelings that have been repeated at the [Malaga Festival](https://elpais.com/smoda/famosos/2025-03-18/nicole-wallace-ana-rujas-o-blanca-suarez-de-dia-y-de-noche-todos-los-looks-del-festival-de-malaga.html), where on Saturday the film won the Golden Biznaga and Garlo's work was awarded as best female performance (*ex aequo* with Ángela Cervantes).

1l96d6i,deaf,Need something for apartment living.,"I was using a ring doorbell cam for my apartment door out in the hallway because there were people rummaging through my packages or outright stealing them and delivery people not able to alert me when I had a package.

However, I've gotten tired of it because it keeps on alerting me every time people are walking by, which is, like, all the time. I just want something that alerts me ONLY when I have a package or if there are actual people standing directly in front of my door.

So I was thinking... what if there was like a sound-based version of it or something? where it transcribes the sound of what's going on out there and summarizes it day by day for me with time stamps or something.

[댓글]
for the ring doorbell, you can turn off motion notifications and have it only notify you when someone rings the doorbell. [ring website](https://ring.com/support/articles/d6p12/managing-alerts-for-ring-doorbells-and-cameras?srsltid=AfmBOooZ14fMAHMw9rBfwT4VsnQWuoimNW1AV4_Vqbj5Fbuc2S-MT4IT)

Most delivery services nowadays can text you when the delivery has been made.

You can use a Ring and the “Doorbell Boa” metal housing on your door for a non-permanent installation, and the Ring subscription so that you can keep recordings of people coming to the door.

1l8szlh,deaf,Did I fuck up?,"Okay, so I’m hearing and work with a deaf guy (U.S., federal government). Because of doge cuts, a lot of the services he relies on (like interpreters) have been slashed. I know that’s not legal, and I think he’s working through the union. He uses a hearing aid and reads lips, but it’s clear this is not ideal, especially in group settings.

I took ASL in high school, so I have a basic familiarity. I recently started brushing up on it, thinking maybe I could incorporate a few signs here and there when we talk. I’ve relearned the basics but always feel a little awkward trying. So today in the break room we were chatting about the weather, and I decided to ask about how to sign a few words like “hot,” “warm,” and “humid.” I thought it was going okay, but then he suddenly kind of shut down, grabbed his tea, and walked off.

Now I’m worried I accidentally committed a faux pas or made him feel like I was trying to get free ASL lessons or something. Did I mess up? If so how do I apologize? 

[댓글]
I would just ask him.

We can only guess but consider that you were asking him a lot of vocab and not having a conversation with him.  Try to see it from his perspective.

As a deaf guy myself, just ask him if you did something wrong and you meant no offense since you are no expert at asl-still on the learning curve so he shouldn’t take it personally if you misinterpret something. Slashing his interpreters for his job is a violation against human rights. 😠 make sure he get an interpreter!

Who knows? He May have been having a bad day? It’s hard, personally I (coda) would for the next few encounters just do a friendly wave, with a smile and let him further the next conversation.

Although cuts and politics suck, remember some deaf are just like anyone else, and some might be anti-social and rude. Maybe he didn’t feel like giving lessons,or realized he was late for a meeting.

I work with many people from different parts of the world. I usually don’t mind questions on pronunciation or conversation about meanings of American words/phrases, but sometimes they do become a bit boring and I try and cut out early :D no reason deaf can’t feel the same thing!

Hey OP,

It probably had nothing to do with your friendly approach. If his accessibility accommodations were being slashed due to budget cuts, just imagine the emotional weight he’s carrying in that work environment right now. I'd be upset too, pissed off toward the administration for taking away something as essential as my accommodations. In that kind of headspace, socializing with coworkers might be the last thing on his mind.

Source: I’m Deaf, and I went through something very similar once. It was a dark time, and I remember shutting down completely. Give him some time and space. Your effort to reach out in ASL probably meant more than you realized.

So he was on break.  In the break room.  And seemed like he took a break.

Try opening with “It makes me sad that so many things have happened that made it harder for you to work here. I want to help make things a little easier for you, but my ASL is weak, would you mind teaching me some signs as they come up in conversation?”

You need to ask him. We couldn’t know just based on that. He likely isn’t stupid, and will understand you only had good intentions. 

I thing worth mentioning is that even with good accommodations it’s tiring to communicate, and if he currently doesn’t have good accommodations, then I’m pretty sure he gets so tired that he simply can’t give a very good impression for long, even when doing his best. Plenty of Hard of Hearing get burnt out and on long sick leaves because they’re trying to be nice and keep up in a hearing environment. Deaf are usually better at that, since they often don’t seem as hearing and people understand the limits slightly better. I’m just saying that, since he might often not have the energy to handle things well. If he has been communicating or in a meeting for an hour and used all his cognitive efforts on trying to figure out what’s going on, and not appearing too stupid or uninterested, then he might grympy and tired afterwards, even when trying not to. Chatting at lunch which hearing people love and which gives them energy and inclusion, can definitely become too much for someone who can’t hear well. (And at the same time, we don’t really want to isolate ourselves either.) Nonetheless, that fatigue really puts us in a poor position to give a good impression when communicating. (And can lead to health problems.) If you add the time he needs to spend on explaining to his union and to the HR, then you can see how it can affect someone. (Lots of sleep, exercise, healthy food and patience are some of things one can do to cope.) 

So let’s say something, anything at all, might have gone wrong in the conversation you had, it’s quite possible he didn’t have the energy to get things back on track in a nice way at the moment. 

If you consistently create a relaxed and friendly environment and show you mean well, I do think he should be aware of that. Don’t worry, show that you are happy to communicate and be patient if things don’t go well sometime.

Like you would with anyone??


""I'm sorry I asked you to help with my signing, I thought it would be helpful to you if I was able to sign more with you in the office, but I can see now it was rude to expect you to use your break time on teaching me. I won't ask that of you again"" 


Esp bc like... Talking about the weather not gonna help communicate about work more easily unless that's what your job is??

Yes. 

Don't use him to learn ASL. He's not a teacher. He is your coworker. Don't do it again.

Just going off your post, it's possible you accidentally signed something offensive, or he didn't appreciate being used as a free ASL teacher. But honestly just ask him

Never assume someone with a hear aid and “can read lips” is really hearing you. Use written word or text to avoid confusing.

1l8gjuq,deaf,Peer taught into to ASL workshop and culture concerns,"Recently there are no asl classes in the area when there used to. I am HOH and I have studied ASL for 10 years and been a peer tutor for 6 years I want to do a peer taught 12 part series workshop on Intro to ASL at my library. I am not a professional teacher but have skill in teaching/tutoring ASL. I do have a deaf professor who would be willing to come them to support me. All proceeds would go towards fundraising for my service dog.

I asked a friend if she wanted to participate and she said very strongly ""NO!"" She had some very strong feelings. ""I am hearing and ASL is not my first language. ASL teachers should be Deaf"" she spoke about it like it was synonymous to being illegal for a hearing person to teach ASL

I have heard this before and I absolutely believe that ASL is better taught by a deaf or CODA person. However, without access to deaf teachers should there be no classes at all.

 What do people think about this idea?

[댓글]
&gt;I asked a friend if she wanted to participate 

You don’t comment on her background or fluency level in ASL. 

But also, I’m in the camp of if someone says “no,” they usually mean no. I wouldn’t try to convince her otherwise like “I asked a small portion of the deaf community on Reddit and they said it’s totally fine to disregard your own opinions,” y’know? 

You said that you’d be leading the course with the support of a deaf professor, so why do you need additional support? Are you trying to get extra teachers or just language models, or what?  

What about access online courses taught by deaf teachers, such as Bill Vicars? Sure, there’s tons of benefits to in-person classes, but you have to weigh that against things like qualifications, the structure of the workshop, what resources are being used, etc. 

Go to r/asl and you’ll find every opinion on deaf vs hearing teachers you could ever want and more. But for your specific situation, without access to more info, I’d say let your friend be. Her opinion is valid, and she does not have to teach an ASL workshop if she doesn’t want to, regardless of justification.

Your friend is right. Hearing people, generally shouldn't be teaching sign language. 


A CODA is an acceptable alternative if necessary if they're actually fluent with sign.


&gt;All proceeds would go towards fundraising for my service dog.


That's a bit self centered don't you think? Why don't you get a weekend job or something. I don't like the idea of you collecting funds while using a public space, probably for free or nearly free.

Jason Gervase and SignPlaying have posted about hearing people teaching a lot lately. It’s mostly aimed at social media teachers. 

I would defer this answer to Dr Bill from [LifePrint](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/hearing-people-teach-sign-language.htm). Basically, case by case, would the qualified hearing person cause harm to the Deaf community. Jason has added that in person hearing ASL teachers need to recognize their privilege and incorporate Deaf voices in the classroom as often as they can. 

As for your friend refusing to help, that’s their choice. I agree with surdophobe about the use of funds. Either volunteer your time, donate the money to the local Deaf community services, or treat it like any other job and use the money privately however you want. Don’t use a SD prospect to justify your choice.

""without access to deaf teachers""

This is a scarcity mindset y'all trot out to obfuscate the true issue. It's not about whether *you* specifically can find a class led by a Deaf person. It's the systemic barriers to access for Deaf people in teaching and other occupations.

Do I think your friend should teach asl by herself? No! Do I think it's fine for her to assist you as a hoh person teaching with input from a Deaf teacher, sure, but also she said no so this isn't about her now it's about you. 


I think make sure you are linking your students with Deaf led steps to continue their education from here and be very clear this is an intro course to give you a taste, you aren't gonna learn a whole language in twelve weeks and you good. 


Id also encourage your students to follow Deaf content creators, and like, warn them away from following asl students trying to teach sign on insta, or worse, them becoming that person. 


Honestly the fact that only Deaf should teach sign seems news to you does make me a little sketch on do you have enough cultural understanding to be teaching, but I'm giving you a lot of grace for your Deaf professor wouldn't be down with it if this was a bad idea so 🙃


I'm also a little suss on the service dog fundraising idea. I guess as long as you open about it it's fine, but yeah

If it were me I would not collect funds for this. I would teach as a volunteer.

My best friend and I are both hearing and while we were in school, we were ASL lab instructors for the world languages department at our university. We lead 30 minute sessions in conjunction with the student’s ASL college courses with a Deaf professor. We worked closely with the professors and their syllabi to honor what the students were learning. 

We worked as lab instructors for 2 1/2 years and had plenty of experience in leading lesson plans and reviewing sign with students. That being said, when we graduated (at this point having a decade of experience with ASL) a company reached out to us and asked if we would create ASL teaching videos to be published online and shared with those interested in learning. We said no. We didn’t feel comfortable. We are not D/deaf or Hard of Hearing and it’s not our space to teach a language and culture that isn’t ours. I can respect why you’re hearing friend doesn’t wish to participate.",2025-06-11 01:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l8gjuq/peer_taught_into_to_asl_workshop_and_culture/

My professor, and the other coach are great, and do their best but I realize they are trying to teach about 35 people at a time so I mostly just ask them my questions, and I’m also trying to help remind people all the time I can’t hear the timer or coaches if we stop, I’ve tried looking in my area to see if any gyms offer deaf classes, but no luck.

Teach and participate in BJJ.

Previously practiced Shou Sho.

I used to play soccer and some MMA, and it’s hard, but not impossible. 
I’m sure you’ve talked with them a bit, but communicating what you need is the solution. 

Ask for visual cues instead of audio, visible timer, signing or general hand signals, and my favorite being mirrors. 

Besides that, I suggest asking for a few minutes before to chat with them about what you’re doing 1 on 1, and work with people who understand.

I used to have a partner during games and matches that’d tap me 3 times for an alert and relay info.

It’s also a personal choice, but my uniform had Deaf and a logo on it. It helped a lot when people were behind me, but it also kind of felt like it branded me as “The Deaf Person”. 

There may be some online groups that aren’t local but could still give some insight, I suggest checking Facebook.

Did BJJ for 7 years prior to going Deaf - afterwards was extremely difficult. However it’s possible.  You need understanding sparring partners, coaches and patience. Hang in there mate you’ve got this. 

As for the timer thing I feel your pain, I always preface any sparring with “I wont hear the buzzer so apologies if I carry on but try you best to let me know”. 

Now though I have an idea of what a 5 minute round is like however if it’s a competitive roll I can quite easily get lost in it and continue after the buzzer.",2025-06-11 01:17:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l8g0zh/advise_on_doing_something_mostly_not_deaf_friendly/
1l8fprc,deaf,Deaf brother is overly dependent on me,"My little brother (53) was a preemie and has always been deaf. He's also a little off mentally in a way that's hard to describe, but he's intelligent. He attended a deaf school when he was young, but never learned sign language. He can lip read to some degree.

Our single mother was abusive. To me, she was mentally and physically abusive, but the way she abused him was much different. She suffocated him, wouldn't let him think for himself, didn't want him to grow up, and would even do his homework. She never taught him how to take care of himself, even basic hygiene. All the while, he could do no wrong in her eyes.  It reminds me of Pink Floyd's ""Mother"" song.  
  
I often had to care for him when I was just a child--I'm six years his senior. I got married at 17 and moved far away for many years, but moved back home recently. One of my greatest fears has always been that someday, I'd be responsible for him. 

That day came after our mom died in 2020. She'd done everything for him, even delivering meals to his house each day. Afterward, I'd text him to see how he's doing. I thought he was doing okay in the small house he owned, but I was wrong. 

In January, he was admitted to the hospital with gangrene in his feet as he wasn't taking care of his diabetes. After getting amputations, he was in the hospital for weeks. My adult son and I went to his house each day to care for his dog. No one else in the family would help. His house was a horror story in itself; it reeked, absolutely filthy, a hoarder house. It was very hard for us to go there each day. We tried to clean it, but it was too way much for us--I have a lot of health problems myself.

In early April, he was finally released. My husband and I took him to his appointments each week, and are still doing so. That has all been hard too, cutting into our time to do other things. But what's especially hard for me, is the way he formed a dependence on me, always wanting me to make phone calls for him, always wanting me to go in during his medical exams as he can't hear well enough, and wanting us to take him everywhere. He also obsessively texts me numerous times a day as if I'm at his beck and call. That was understandable at first, but he's doing much better now, and there's no end in sight of him wanting to regain his independence. 

I care about him, but I'm beginning to run short on patience as it has been six months.  Do you have any suggestions? Is there a way he could make his own phone calls? What about transportation? He's on SSI, and so he really can't afford cabs. Are there any other organizations that could help him?

Thank you!

I’m sorry. Looks like you got bad childhood but he even more so. 

A combination of trauma and probably a seasoning of language deprivation as well. 

However, it looks like he needs support? Formal support. Not you. You should be just a normal brother. I think you need to contact the appropriate services. Telling them he used to depend on his mother.

Yes this will depend on where you live. Try contracting the hospital see if he is still eligible for out patient social worker, or contact deaf organisation in your area. Like the other comment said he needs formal support. It might take a lot of work to get set up, but it will be worth it in the long run

Your post history makes it seem like you have a lot of family drama. I’d suggest therapy and reaching out to the care team that supported him for three months in the hospital about resources in your area he could benefit from.

&gt; Is there a way he could make his own phone calls


Possibly, can he read ok? Does he speak at all, if so is he intelligible? Can he use a computer keyboard?  You mention he never learned sign language, so that limits his options a little.


&gt;What about transportation?


In many cities there are organizations that provide free (or very cheap) rides for people with disabilities. They're terribly limited though, so not as convenient as a taxi or Uber. 


We'd have to know what city you're in to know more but you may want to Google for those things so you don't have to disclose.


Ever heard of the children's book ""The Giving Tree"" ? There's a parody ending to the story called ""The Tree That Set Healthy Boundaries"" Go take a look. You aren't helping your brother if it burns you out, so it's best to be there for him without being his sole caretaker.


Good luck, you're a good big sister.

Set up VRS and then cut off the help with phone calls. Connect him with local Deaf adults for socializing. The variety will keep him from fixating on one person and being codependent on them. But understand this too: the Hearing world is still largely inaccessible and forces the Deaf people toward a tendency of codependence. 

Then, get him a therapist, get him into DOR for vocational rehab.

If he can speak and read well, try Nagish app for captions call instead of VRS

If he has a mobile phone, either android or iPhone you can set up captions which will turn speech to text for incoming and outgoing calls, very easy to do. If you’re in the UK you can contact adult social services, as he definitely needs help with his health issues. If you’re based elsewhere, there must be an equivalent care provider available. You’ve both been victims unfortunately, very sad but he is not beyond independence yet.  Good luck

He was raised without a community, cut off from learning life skills and the learned helplessness is crushing him and you.  The window of his potential was slammed shut long ago and I applaud your efforts to open up his world.  

It will be hard not to be angry when he resists change, he probably will.  Seems he has long term damage physically as well as mentally from your mom.  I hope you all are able to find peace and happiness.

Deaf nursing home. Look it ip

He sounds like a good candidate to have a nurse check up on him (assuming you can afford it and/or the county offers help)

It sounds a bit like the mum installed learned helplessness in him. As in, she helped grow his mind to always feel he needed her. This can occur with spouses too. 


You've not just the disabilities to deal with but essentially rewriting a lifelong narrative. 


Though there's going to be a number of things that he'll be able to do to an extent, with adaptations or support, that's only going to go so far if his mind genuinely believes he's unable to do much.

Hey OP, hearing person who works in healthcare here but just bringing it up because I haven’t heard anyone else mention it. I know it sounds like one more thing to add to the list, but you may benefit from some sort of caregiver support group (there are a lot on Zoom these days). 

I understand that your brother’s being deaf absolutely adds another layer to this, but there are a LOT of people who are also struggling in their roles of providing support to family members who have issues with self-care, especially medical. People here have good suggestions for formal supports — I would just encourage you to find some space where you can vent and get ideas that aren’t your own marriage. 

You will probably continue to be in some sort of care support role (though hopefully more sustainable) for the rest of his life as he ages and you (I imagine) are likely to become the family member that hospitals, nursing facilities, home health, etc. reach out to. I don’t say that to discourage you, because your load *can* be lighter, but just to shore *yourself* up with supports as well.

We can help more if you can post what area you are in.  Are you in the US? If so, what state/region?  There is something called a TTY-if he does not sign, this is probably a good option for him.  A relay operator reads what he types and they type what the other person says on the phone.",2025-06-11 01:01:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l8fprc/deaf_brother_is_overly_dependent_on_me/
1l8f1d1,deaf,Have any other deaf HS seniors/college students written their college application essay about being deaf?,"I’m deaf since birth (with a hearing aid and a cochlear implant) and an upcoming HS senior. I’ve been going back and forth on my college admission essay topic for months, but all of the topics I’ve stuck with (and the current version that I really like) involve my deafness in a central way. 
I’m a little bit scared to be so open about my disability because the essay isn’t centered on the actual nuances of how it affects me/the capabilities that I have (ex I can speak, I don’t know much ASL/don’t use it to communicate, I don’t plan on requesting accommodations in college). None of that fits into the essay (both in its topic/focus and in the word count), so it makes me scared that admissions officers are going to judge off the bat because they don’t have any context for my disability. 
I know it’s technically illegal to discriminate on the basis of disability (not sure if it’s ever been specifically applied to college admissions, but I’m sure it’s in the fine print somewhere). At the same time, if it’s a red flag to colleges then they can just give me the boot and not tell me why, and I don’t want my essay to hurt my chances just because it doesn’t fully explain my disability. 

2 questions - Is it worth it to use the additional information section to briefly outline my capabilities/the nature of my deafness? Have any other deaf/HOH people successfully made being deaf the centerpiece of a college admissions essay?

Thanks in advance!

[댓글]
I'm not American so I can't help with the college bit. However, every deaf person has a different relationship with language. How you language embodies your journey through life. So don't worry about not knowing much ASL. 

It's clear that deafness is an important part of your identity, so write about what it means to you, and only to you. You could write about how you don't fit into some mythical model of the all signing deafie. And to be honest, very few people do. Around 90% of signing deaf people started signing later in life. 

Maybe because we weren't allowed to; maybe our language was kept away from us; maybe our parents made choices that excluded language; maybe our parents were advised that was what was 'best' for us. Or maybe we as children internalised our own fear of 'the other' and told our parents 'no I don't want to sign'. Many reasons. Many journeys through life and our changing and evolving relationship with identity and language.

I'm DHH (severe-profound bilaterally, hearing aid user just shy of meeting CI criteria), and my being deaf was the focus of my college application! in addition to helping me request accommodations - which I really suggest you look into, at least preferential seating and transcripts/captions for videos (because lecture rooms are very hard to hear in, more than I even expected!), there are disability-centric scholarships and grants you can qualify for. plus, being deaf impacts all areas of our life, regardless of communication mode and language, and not everyone has this story to share! absolutely go for it!

My uni application essay (way back in 2014, god help me) was centered on my deafness.

I started with an anecdote about how in 8th grade my careers adviser saw that one of my goals was to go to college, and he was confused for a minute before he said, “Oh, you mean you’ll go to a special college for people like you.” So I was motivated to prove Deaf Can, etc. 

Since I was going into an English studies program, my essay focused on my love of literature and how because speech was inaccessible to me (bilaterally severe-to-profoundly deaf, no assistive hearing tech or ASL, though I did not mention these things), reading afforded me access to the world. If I were going into mathematics, I probably would have fallen back on cliches like math is a universal language. Or if I were going for theater, I might have written about how expressive the body and face can be, with an anecdote about seeing and loving a stage production as a child. 

The application board wants you to tell them a story about who you are and who you want to become, and how your chosen program/university will help you become this person you want to be. Deafness is a part of you, and it’s going to impact the trajectories of your educational, social, and work lives. They want to see that you can both reflect on these kinds of journeys and choose a path forward.

I included deafness in my application essay, but it was not ABOUT being deaf.

My deafness was part of my application (sooo many years ago!). My focus was in how my deafness doesn’t define me. It was about being a figure skater, graduating near the top of my class in’s mainstream school, etc. - things I had accomplished that we are often told we can’t - not “because of but in spite of” my deafness.

What you want to do is focus on the great problem-solving abilities you've picked up by being deaf, even if you have to couch something unfair or traumatic in a slightly more positive way to get past the (sigh) potentially discriminatory admin officer.

IE:

You've learned to seek out different sources of information beyond what you are simply ""told"" - you have a feel for double-checking facts or proactively seeking out new sources.

The old classic ""I have a natural feel for non-verbal language and reading a room and have empathy with other people's emotions.""

You've developed a relationship with technology which is assistive and supportive, and are keen to keep learning.

I've been a career professional for a little over a decade and burning out. I've always had an interest in becoming a teacher, and at the nudging by several friends, I am finally taking the plunge and switching careers. In my journey towards becoming a certified public school teacher, I learned that passing a Praxis Deaf/HoH Special Education (5272) exam is important so that I am better qualified to teach at a Deaf school or serve as a Deaf/HoH Special Education teacher at a regular hearing school. 

Where I need advice is this: I've been looking for test prep courses and although there are special education courses available, I'm not finding a course specifically for Deaf/HoH education. There are practice tests available along with a study guide that I could purchase such as at ExamEdge but I'm more interested in a full course. So, what special education test prep courses would you recommend? Perhaps Special Education: Core Knowledge and Applications Exam (5354) Prep through Study.com?

You might want to get your foot in the door by working at a school for the Deaf. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were study groups for teachers on emergency permits needing to take the D/HH praxis. My workplace/school had several praxis study groups.

I took it and passed a couple years ago! One big tip I have is to think like a hearing person when answering the questions. As a Deaf (myself) educator who had experience teaching Deaf/HH students and went through a Deaf Ed masters program that emphasized bilingual teaching methods (ASL and English)… I know what a Deaf/HH classroom is supposed to look like… but the hearing people who created this test… well, they have their biases. It’s best to go into that test with your “hearie hat” on 😅 Think like a teacher who works in a mainstream classroom.

1l89nt0,deaf,In a crossroads between hearing and silence,"Hello everyone,
I posted a while ago about a similar discussion. (Thank you to those of you who helped me get my post the right community.)
I (24/f) am hard of hearing and have been recommended implants.
On one hand- choosing to continue that process makes sense as I was born and have lived in the hearing world all my life.
But on the other hand- loosing my hearing has been a slow and natural progression for a big part of my life. I have been told that by the time I’m 30 I will be completely deaf.
That means for a large majority of my life I will be.
I have been learning asl and researching the deaf world a lot lately. And I feel connected towards what I’ve learned. Ive enjoyed learning about this world that’s opened up to me.
But its been a slow process as I don’t know anyone my area who is deaf. Simply learning asl and reading about the community won’t teach how to communicate properly normally immerse me in the world. I know that.
And so, I have questions.
Is there anyone in this Reddit community who was hoh and chose to continue their life as a deaf person instead of getting implants?
From some of my readings I’ve learned that people who weren’t born deaf or are hoh aren’t always considered to be apart of the community.
Is this true? If so to what extent?
Would I be considered apart of this amazing community if I continued down this path?
I already don’t feel connected towards the hearing or the deaf communities as much I would want to be. But either way, I want to continue to learn more about this one.
Please let me know your thoughts and opinions.

Right now you're worrying too much about ""finding your community"" and not enough about finding yourself. 


You're already ""one of us"" and there are many different ways to be deaf. If you get a cochlear implant, you're still deaf. 


When I was in my 20s, I also knew that I would probably be deaf by the time I was 30, and I was. I've had zero use of my left ear since age 17 and by the time I was 30, I was functionally deaf. I had pretty much no speech comprehension without lip-reading. I didn't get a cochlear implant for another 15 years, about six months ago.  You're certainly not alone with your experiences. 


What's so amazing about the deaf (or signing) world that you don't already have? It's not all unicorns and rainbows. 


If you choose to get a CI, that's fine, but I highly suggest becoming comfortable in your own skin as a hoh/deaf person first. I got my CI because I wanted it, not because I felt like it was someone I need. I already had a good job, a wife and a house rabbit.",2025-06-10 20:36:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l89nt0/in_a_crossroads_between_hearing_and_silence/

ETA: I am tired of the deaf world, too.

Rochester, NY. https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/25/nyregion/where-sign-language-is-far-from-foreign.html

Rochester, NY has the highest population (edit: per capita) of deaf people in the US.

Minnesota also has a high population of deaf and hoh folks at ~20%.

I’m in Texas. Austin has a large community and Texas School for the Deaf. Texas provides free college for deaf/hard of hearing residents. However Austin isn’t cheap and it’s still Texas. Ideally I would prefer to start a deaf cult and have a compound for all of us to live in.

Outside N America, London is pretty good.  Probably the best alternative English-speaking city.  Lots of Deaf orgs are based there. 

Other options are Dublin, Edinburgh, Sydney, Melbourne etc, but they have smaller Deaf communities, which some people do prefer.  Irish Sign Language is far more similar to ASL than British Sign Language, which is a bonus for US immigrants. 

Then other places like Auckland (New Zealand), Delhi / Mumbai (India), Karachi / Lahore (Pakistan), Johannesberg / Cape Town (South Africa), Nigeria, Philippines, etc. 

All these places are English speaking to a greater or lesser extent, and some of these cities are huge, but you'll have to balance jobs, culture, quality of life, learning the local sign language etc.

When you find one, lmk.

I don’t think there is a singular Mecca, but the cities you mentioned and more (typically wherever the Deaf school is or large urban cities) will work. They all have different vibes, cost of living, job opportunities, activities to do, weather, Deaf-owned businesses, etc. so figure out what you want in addition to interacting with the Deaf community then start there. 

If you want to ask the local Deaf community questions via social media, Facebook is the place. Many deaf communities have their own community pages.

Right now the ""Deaf Mecca"" is not in the United States of America.   IMHO, I'm a Canadian.  It seems to me the U.S. , under it's current sitting President, has turned against diversity, equity, and inclusion altogether now.  Backlash! 

Wish as many of you as possible can relocate out of the US.

Deaf people tend to like big cities. NYC, LA, DC. You're gonna find a lot of deaf people in the city, only problem is that it's expensive to live in

DC!!! Gallaudet area

Rochester is not perfect but is best I have found. I love Rochester! Deaf community is strong, welcoming and holds events just about weekly. Made so many new friends after moving here.

The Clarity AlertMaster is a visual notification system designed for individuals with hearing loss. It provides alerts for various events such as incoming phone calls, doorbells, and other audio alarms. The system uses visual indicators, flashing lights, and a bed shaker to ensure the individual is promptly and clearly alerted.

Additionally, it’s a good idea to contact your local fire station to ask what alert systems they recommend. They may have specific suggestions tailored to your area or needs, especially in case of emergencies like fire or carbon monoxide detection.

1l7bykf,deaf,Building signing fluency with little community access? Worth the effort?,"(Not an option to post this in ASL/BSL and more of a community question rather than language learning tips)

For those of you (especially late-deafened) learning sign, but without access to any in-person or video conversation groups, were you able to build fluency? Was it worth investing in language learning daily for years?

I have my husband to practice with, but there are no accessible community classes (either expensive gatekeeping or too far away) and no community meetups either. I’m concerned if only my husband (hearing) and I learn together, we’ll develop a mix of home signing and actual sign language, which would be challenging if I need an interpreter in the future. 

Basically, is it even worth developing signing skills with such little access…or should I try to keep practicing oral/ear-listening skills (my type of hearing loss fluctuates in severity, so I have easier and harder days), so I can maintain access to social relationships that way instead? 

I’m also not yet fluent in my country’s spoken language, but I’m unsure whether to pursue this fluency first, alongside, or not at all and instead focus on more easy to use communication like signing. But, none of my friends or family sign and there are few resources for them to learn too. 

I’m just wondering, really, is it worth learning to sign if there still is no access to others or good resources. It would help listening fatigue at home, but that’s about all the options it would open up right now.

Language nerd with memory issues here

Research language study methods before learning! 

I suggest starting in this order:

1. sentence structure (syntax) 

2. core vocabulary

3. grammar

4. practice

5. Expand vocab + grammar together 

Structure → Words → Function → Use → Refine

Finally, immerse yourself and practice constantly. Even with perfect memory, people forget and mess up, give yourself some grace and time. 

Reach out to local groups, schools, meetups, and organizations.

Gesture, gesture, gesture. 

Get really confident in gesturing and making up gestures and trying to get over your meaning to people who don’t sign. You’ll start learning what type of gestures are more easily understandable. 

You have a huge advantage being in France where gesturing is almost the national language anyway. 

You could start by asking random people each day for directions even if you know the right way, and just gesture their directions back at them. 

The confidence you get from this is a big help with learning signing. 

Gesturing directions with random hearies is also good practice because you start learning about chaining signs and directionality and how location in signing space works.",2025-06-09 12:02:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l72zga/hearing_loss_has_increased_but_i_have_a_very_poor/

Have you discussed what support you need during supervision?

The thing I learned in hearing therapy is that people are often taken aback when someone says they are HoH or have a disability and  do not know what to do. The best thing to do is enumerate what you need from them. I always start conversations with, just so you know, I am HoH so I need to lipread and may ask you to repeat yourself. Then as the conversations go along, I will add as needed. For example, I need you to face me or else it is difficult to understand. I am having difficulties understanding you because of the poor light so I cannot lipread.

1l6w7gc,deaf,I'm learning about oralism and I'm fuming,"I hope it's okay for me to post this as I'm not deaf and I'll delete this at once if I shouldn't post here but

SO I'm so angry about oralism. I'm not deaf but I'm learning about it for the first time. I'm ashamed I never knew about this.

I'm working on a story idea and one of the characters I wanted to write about is a child who was born deaf. So I've been learning as much as I can about deafness, the deaf community and culture. I was trying to decide what time period I wanted my story to start in when I began to learn about oralism.

So my thought was, my character is a child, she was born deaf so obviously she uses ASL. Because she's been deaf since birth so she doesn't talk, she signs.

She would be taught to sign in school, because of course she would! She's been deaf since birth. I was viewing this character like I would my other characters, only that she signs instead of talks verbally. I just assumed that yeah, of course she'd be taught to sign! She was deaf since birth so she'd be taught all about signing in school

And then I learned about oralism and how they BANNED SIGN in school and were forcing oralism on all deaf kids for over 100 years. And then I'm reading about oralism and I'm shaking with anger and rage. It's beyond fucked up. Banning and discouraging deaf kids from using sign that came naturally to them?? I was suddenly realizing that depending on the time period I set my story in, my character might not be getting taught how to communicate in a way that was natural to her but being forced to do something maybe she couldn't even DO. Cause I was like, if she was deaf since birth... learning to speak... that would be so insanely hard. What if she couldn't?? What happens to her then? If my character is deaf since birth and she struggles under oralism, what happens?

How could they BAN sign from school?? Discourage it?? It doesn't make any sense. And I'm so furious. What started as me researching deafness for my character has me now fuming in rage that the deaf community was treated like this.  
Edit: and as I've been learning more I'm aware it's still happening. It's messed up

It still happens today in the US. There are oral only deaf schools.

In 1880, there was this conference on deaf education in Milan, Italy that we attribute the rise of and stranglehold of oralism to.

Every so often, a hearing person will post a rant here about oralism or some other aspect of discrimination they've only just discovered, and it rarely lands well. For one thing, it isn't past tense. This happens to deaf kids all the time. For another, we...know? Ranting about it on a deaf sub makes it seem like you're expecting praise for being shocked, or maybe gratitude for writing a story with a deaf protagonist. To be blunt, if you aren't deaf, you've only just learnt about Milan, you don't realise it has present-day implications, and your mind boggles at what it would be like for ""your character"" to grow up language deprived (something many people here have lived), it's not a story you're able to write.

FCK AGB

yeah this is me. when I was born, my first language is sign language. but then I went to school and it was decided that sign language would get in the way of learning how to speak, so I was banned from signing. 

im only 31, this happened a couple decades ago. sign language wasn't an official language in my country until 2007, so before that it was just learn how to keep up. this shit is recent (and probably ongoing in some places).

I learned about this stuff in middle school. I’m in my 40s now. I teach now. I’m just tired. Lol. 

Yeah goes without saying I wish Milan 1880 never happened. 

Centuries of language deprivation. With horrible, shortsighted policies. No representation. 

I wish more hearing people like you knew about this.

This is still happening.

Do not remove this thread. This is important. My grandparents who were Deaf told me the stories about hearing teachers using the rulers to spank on their hands for signing or making gestures. It was horrific. Whenever a student signed and got caught, the hearing teachers would punish them savagely. Thanks to Alexander Graham Bell which influenced many deaf schools to get rid of of Deaf teachers in favor of hearing teachers who would abuse the Deaf students - physically, mentally, spiritually and yes, sexually. 

I still remember as a child at VSDB when this accursed speech therapist (Mrs Murray) who would forcefully hold my hands and told me to stare at her face up close - she would try to imitate her mouth at me - the breath of hers was stale from eating Doritos at lunch, I guess - it was nightmarish thing to smell and stare. 

  
Never mind the fact that I have hearing aids and I love it so much - I will not dump it for myself - but for speech therapist to grab my hands forcefully and kept it down while she blew her stale of Doritos in my face - that is utterly gross.  

  
Now you know why I always sneer at the speech therapists.

I suggest watching the documentary “Deaf President Now!” It’s a good overview of some of the more recent struggles and a glimpse into the past.

Now read on the impacts of language deprivation and then consider why deaf people traditionally were called stupid. 

The deaf aren’t stupid. We’re roughly similar as hearing.

Language deprivation beyond a set age deprives your brain and it is irrevocerable. 

So essentially oralism from birth with a person without (or when the child has no use) hearing aids (as in past) or neglect sadly halts the person’s brain and this is why some elder deaf people seemingly being illiterate despite attempts to learn. (And some unfortunate young ones too) (here writing from Sweden pov)

I worked in school one year, first class (6-7 year old kids) and the kids who were taught sign language from start (start as in baby/toddler age) were bright and could follow and has cognitive abilities. Then we got one boy who was neglected until schools start. He was taught sign language and he could sign and communicate but in a formulaic way, very simplistic way. But if you give him a simple challenge he has impaired cognitive abilities. No theory of directions, room and space, nothing. It is like he has become stuck as 2-3 years old cognitively. And then with that in mind I studied older pupils. A 12 years old girl, 6 years in school and signing but still similarly struggling. Both of them have homes where no one signs and were essentially treated like dogs, just directed around.
Truly an impression of “light is on but no one is home” (ok I’m being crass now but that’s best way to convey it)

So im late deafened / Hard of hearing and taking ASL classes. I was actually a bit upset because they teach language not culture so i started learning about Culture and history on my own. Many times people had mentioned milan and the 1880's so i started there ... i made the mistake of reading alexander graham bells ""book"" upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race. So i have never wanted to vomit more in my life it sounds more like a memoir by another historical figure whose initials are A H and wanted to practice eugenics ..... Deaf history is full of cultural and linguistic oppression and the fundamental belief that HEAR on ""EAR""TH .. hearing is superior to a visual language and yes those were capitalized and misspelled on purpose.  

Hearing society still does this .. i myself have been an advocate for equal access for 3 years, and in the very workplace that i have been part of MULTIPLE events and received two awards for they STILL look at me like im a child now because i sign i dont speak and i'm Deaf .. i wont even say hard of hearing anymore. I have a sign name, im learning ASL (in ASL 6) i try and be as active as i can in the Deaf community and have stood up more than once ! I am Deaf I am proud and society needs to learn ASL / signed languages are no different than english / french / german ... except they are visual ! 

Sorry #end rant ... get coffee and chill time. 

All i know is locally one child who physically cannot speak and is profoundly deaf is being forced to speak english and french as well as use a communication board rather than the 200+ signs she knows at age 5

Of course they're not going to teach or talk about this. There is so much history that we are not taught. Schools barely cover the reality of slavery. Ugly laws were in effect until the 70s. Legally denied education. Schools that did take us(and other disabled kids) were often just put in special Ed (I was one, I was in elementary when the ada passed) until technically 1990 with the ADA (if you're in the states). It wasn't until 2010 that the government admitted they were wrong about sign. Oral only schools still exist. Hearing parents are still being told that sign will make kids ""unsuccessful"" and not to allow sign, to make sure hearing aids or ci's are on all waking hours. My education was much more about learning to pass as hearing than an actual education until I put up a fight(and depending on the class/ teacher) Thankfully newer hearing parents of deaf kids have the internet and can find stuff like the deaf reddit or creators on social media. Find deaf nights out, local Deaf communities and mentor programs (depending on what state you're in) 

I was taught that accommodations and access were a gift and not a right. That I was a burden and expensive. I see the younger generation see it as a right, and I'm glad. I was an adult before I learned not to accept scraps for accommodation, but it's still difficult for me to advocate for myself. 

I started speech therapy as a profoundly deaf kid at 2, and got my hearing aids at 4. I'm still struggling to learn ASL as an adult. Everything free for deaf children disappears when you turn 18, then you have to pay. 

Read the posts here. Just learn. You'll see that even though accommodations are supposed to be a right, many(too many) schools and businesses try their hardest to deny every accommodation. If you don't know how to advocate or what the ada grants, you fall through the cracks. For everything that provides access for anyone disabled. Service dogs. Wheelchair access. Interpreters. Did you know churches are legally exempt from following the ada? 

If you have Netflix watch crip camp. 

Learn for learnings sake, I'm glad you're learning. BUT don't write a deaf character in your book. There's a huge history and culture that if you're just starting to learn, there's no way you'll be able to accurately depict a deaf character, especially one who uses ASL as a first language. All the microagressions and just... like deaf people are constantly asked if we can drive, think(yes, think), read braille, and just doing normal everyday things is ""inspiring"", so many people think hearing aids or ci's are a cure. That's just the really obvious stuff. We're constantly told we don't ""look deaf"" or that we have selective hearing. Emergency plans in schools often just leave the ""hard"" students out of their plans and are often left behind (think, fire, school shootings, there's a documentary about disabled people who survived 9-11, some worked in the WTC)

TIL I was victim of oralism. Man, It does explain a lot of my mental issues.

If you aren't actively working with and hiring a consultant, this is a horrible idea. Right now you are using the deaf community to help write your Story without having to pay a consultant for it. This is disgusting behavior. Just because you're learning about oralism and wanting to write about a character using ASL and being deaf, you think you can come in here with your fake outrage.

You have to realize it’s much more complicated than that. Try to understand more about this. Hearing people don’t wish Deaf people anything ill, mostly, they just misunderstand a lot about what it is like to be Deaf due to not having the experience themselves. It’s quite hard to see how much or how little we hear in various contexts. Degree of hearing loss, type of hearing loss and context has a huge impact. Today there is plenty of awareness, but I would say we still have considerable isses due to the technical development. Many people with deafness can hear a lot thanks to hearing aids and Cochlear Inplants (CI). Unfortunately, hearing people don’t understand how much impact deafness can have, because outwards we seem to get by well. When someone gets a CI, it’s definitely necessary to practice listening a lot. Many take this as an excuse for an oralist approach, even though sign language definitely is a useful language and tool for any CI user. There are so many different variables influencing why we have a hard time being heard. (Pun intended.)

Don’t write anything now, but continue learning about Deaf culture and sign languages. Think about how to really advocate and how to explain this complex issue so that people actually understand. Even better if you later on support a Deaf group or person in their advocacy, instead of taking such a role on yourself. There are many Deaf who know what they are talking about, and you should just help them in reaching out.

It's not history. It's current. 

I wasn't even told I had hearing loss when I was younger, just that I needed hearing checks every year and everything was fine. I was raised as hearing and I found out at 19 when I went for a check up that I had been classed as hard of hearing since I was a few months old.

My parents say it was because of the 'stigma' so apparently constantly being told to 'pay more attention ' 'listen harder' and 'stop ignoring people' was better than them telling my school or even me I couldn't hear properly.

My high school didn’t offer ASL either. I don’t know if they banned it, but Its definitely infuriating as a HoH student back then. I actually recently send an email to the superintendent urging them to include an ASL class

Not all people who are deaf sign, not all speak and not all read lips. And that includes born deaf and lost hearing later in life. So I fully support communicate however works best for you. Telling someone you must do one or the other is wrong. IMO

Sign language isn’t a thing in the UK. My daughter learnt it in first year of primary school. That was just the basics. I was forced to learn how to speak at 12 years old after years of being unable to speak proper, and I absolutely hated it. I am 40 now and sign comes naturally to me, even though I wasn’t taught it at all

Purchase otter ai at work's expense.  Otter ai can transcribe everything on zoom call or teams too

Advocating for yourself is difficult because many people simply don’t get it. 
Work with both HR and any local government support systems/organizations, they can act as a middle man.

Many hearing people mistake auditory problems for preference or difficulty. Use simple, medical based language reinforced by the audiologist’s letter to describe it.

You usually have to explain it’s not a matter of effort or practice, but a hard physiological difference/limit that can’t be easily improved with training or equipment. 

I suggest learning a signed language eventually, as there’s so many benefits, but it’s a personal choice.

As for spoken to English accommodations, here’s some I’ve used.

- Asking for only one person to speak at a time, using zoom meetings exclusively so I can have visual cues.

- Using live captioning, CART, or interpreter

- Requesting the meeting be split into two parts if the overlaps can’t be avoided. 

- Follow up emails, meeting notes


If HR still doesn’t get it, you can go through ADA or the equivalent of where you live, or if they continue to deny, you can file a complaint or request mediation via your state’s disability rights agency or the EEOC.

Look for allies or management higher up that can help represent with you.

Finally, being deaf doesn’t make you less professional, effective or competent. Needing accommodations doesn’t mean you’re incapable, it means you’re adapting intelligently to a new reality. 

Don’t think or phrase it as what you can’t do, but how you can do it, with the right support.

Some people are stuck on their own perspective and see deafness or disability as less than. That can be an uphill battle, so pick and choose which ones you want to fight.

Vocational Rehab should also help (state-funded) with certain devices, hearing aids, etc.

Are you using live captioning for Zoom and calls?

OKay so question and answer time first of all what country are you in that makes a difference as to what supports you can ask for . 

I have had to do this once and it turned into a very carefully worded letter (documents are harder to disprove emails are even harder btw ! ) 

I have already spoken twice regarding accommodations and provided documents stating that i have a medically proven hearing loss requiring accommodations. (this part will depend on your country!!!) When I was hired I was hired because you saw potential in me to be a valued addition to this companies team. The request for accommodation is no different than another staff member requesting a pen, your providing me the tools needed to do my job and to excel at it not only so that I can contribute to our workplace but also so that i can ensure our companies future success. After all part of being able to contribute is being able to hear my team mates and our clients ideas and requests.   
  
As such im requesting the following accommodations ..  

Remember list only what is medically supported saying i need a JBL $500 headset is not an accommodation ... lol also keep in mind they are specific to your level of hearing loss. while others myself included may reccomend ideas its up to you to determine whether or not they are suitable .... in my case for example yes otter / live transcribe are awesome tools, however the hearing aid compatible phone is no longer an option because i have no voice so now i need to use ip relay/ chat apps / tty to contact others ... again you need to determine what suits you and make sure you include im willing to work with human resources to be able to reach an acceptable accommodation however i need the right tools to succeed ...  we need to work together to ensure this

  
If nessecary remind them that most accommodations when it comes to hearing loss are in fact attitude / procedural and cost little to nothing. My workplace it was a hearing aid compatible phone (150$), access to a computer terminal for training not a handheld and that someone may have to let me know if there is a evacuation request. Again 90% of hearing related accommodations are procedural !!!

Thats my excessively long 2 cents

You may consider purchasing PLAUD [voice recorder](https://amzn.to/4dqe6VO) as a company expense. During meetings, our company frequently utilizes AI products to enhance productivity and efficiency. A meeting voice recorder provides an excellent solution for quickly converting audio into text transcripts, enabling us to efficiently review discussions and assign tasks based on meeting minutes.

1l6cdqz,deaf,Closed-captioning Concerns with DVDs - Need guidance,"Due to financial concerns, I don't go to movie theaters or stream networks like Netflix. Therefore I rely upon DVD borrowing from my public library. However, as time has gone on, I am bringing home titles that either have the CC logo on the DVD box only to play it and it doesn't have that on the menu - if it even has a menu. Meanwhile, I review the library catalog and the same thing, titles listed as having closed-captioning do not.

In reviewing other posts on this and other sites, people have commented as it being a problem with my player. But why would the DVD work on some titles and not on others due to the device - especially since I have a TV that does play captions when I watch live?

I have also learned that DVD companies are moving away from adding captioning in a move to this ""on-demand"" offering which includes just the TV show or movie. No extras such as commentary, bloopers and captioning - all apparently given the same weight despite captioning I thought was covered under government laws to be accessible to all.

Now I have heard of ripping subtitles off sites or using torrent sites, but it feels and reads like a lot of work to go on risky sites to obtain something that if I buckled down and paid for a streamer I could get without the hassle. But that brings up the question, what does accessibility for mean and what does it apply to if I can file a complaint if a television network or streamer doesn't provide this service but can't if a DVD does - when oftentimes both are owned and operated by the same companies?

  
I am asking if I am missing some rule or reason this DVD situation has it own rules and why I can't find it after many hours surfing the web? Are there other people experiencing/experienced this and how have they overcome this?

 I know DVDs are just a step younger than VHS but it is not like VHS and no one produces them. There is definitely an audience especially many streamers don't carry those extras never mind some movies and TV shows are not on streaming due to licensing restrictions and other beyond the scope of this post reason.

Have a way for Deaf people to contact you. An email listed is great only if the replies are prompt. The people answering the phones should know that VRS and IP relays exist. They need to be patient through the pauses and speak directly to the Deaf person, not the operator.

One thing you need to consider that technology alone is not the solution to accessibility. There's always the human barrier.  Interpreters don't work if they're not scheduled, captions don't work if they're not turned on.  You need to make it easy and pretty fool proof that these things get used. 

Two examples.  Once upon a time not too long ago I went to a clinic for a yearly checkup and they had to ask me dozens of crap questions that they ask me every time. well live transcribe wasn't working for me at all, it was excruciating and a waste of everyone's time. After the nurse left and I was waiting (again) I realized that on the back of the door in a little file holder were all the F@#$ing questions in writing.   
 Another time, same clinic, I discovered that making an appointment over the patient portal (instead of calling on the phone) had been broken.  (You can't fill a required field when there's nothing available in the drop-down) I contacted them about it and they said they knew, then I asked if it was their policy or if it would be fixed in the future, Wouldn't you know they let me make an appointment over email after that.  I don't go there anymore but those are examples of how humans got in the way of access 

It's always the humans, it's rarely the technology that presents barriers.

A few things...

\-If you give tours, make sure there's a policy and procedure in place to get an interpreter and that every staff knows about it.

\-If your front desk has a computer, can the screen be flipped so you can type something to show the deaf customer?

\-If you have movies or audio features, are there captions?

You can make manual communication boards for customer service points instead of needing to rely on technology. Like others have said make sure things are accessabile, like a communication board is less helpful if someone has to find a way to communicate with you even to ask for it /know it exists


If you have a mostly kids something with childish images is okay, if a lot of adults then go with something more appropriate. Actually practice using them for common interactions your customer service staff have (with both sides only using the boards to make sure you aren't missing things) 


Also provide social stories on your website, ie walk someone through an entire visit to your center. What will it look like when you get there. What kind of exhibits are there. Where are the bathrooms. The more you let someone orientate themselves in advance the less they likely to get stuck and need to try communicate with staff. So also clear signs.


(also what everyone else said, just focussing on the ones i haven't seen mentioned yet)

1l3ypey,deaf,Cochlear implant compatibility,"TLDR - How to connect PC to cochlear, otherwise, how okay are Macs for games?

I have always struggled to play games with my cochlear implant on my computer, in the past I struggled with phone calls then bluetooth came out then you could use phones with an app and Bluetooth, if I wanted to implement the same technology for a computer is it possible via a Bluetooth connection in a similar style?

If I'm unable to connect any PC to this technology, I was thinking of getting a Mac, as per [https://www.cochlear.com/global/en/compatibility/devices](https://www.cochlear.com/global/en/compatibility/devices), which states they're compatible. What would the situation be gaming-wise, considering Macs are not typically recommended for gaming or is there a way to upgrade a Mac to still use this technology and be upgraded via like Geforce or something as other forums suggested.

If you can connect to a phone using Bluetooth, you should be able to do the same with a PC, as long it has bluetooth or an Bluetooth adapter.


I don't have IC, I use hearing aids, but I can connect to my PC using an adapter, that I plug into the headphone jack, and then I pair my HA with the adapter.


However, something you need to be aware is that Bluetooth has a bit of delay, so depending on the game, it might be relevant enough to make a difference.

The only way to connect on a Windows computer is to use an accessory such as Mini mic or TV Streamer.

why not just use your minimic?

If you have an android phone it's possible to route your PC audio to your phone using the AudioRelay app. This allows you to stream PC audio via your phone.

3 options. Mini-mic, phone clip, or TV streamer. All 3 options will require the phone app to ""turn them on"". 

Mini-mic plugs into aux-jack on your PC, phone clip connects to pc via Bluetooth, and TV streamer plugs into pc via sound connector on back on pc. Once connected, just open phone app and turn on streaming.

Personally, I prefer the TV streamer.",2025-06-05 13:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l3ypey/cochlear_implant_compatibility/

1l3qe3y,deaf,Should I get an audiologist appointment behind my parents back?,"(Originally posted this on another sub but nobody answered so I'm asking here)  
  
I only realized I'm struggling with hearing after the pandemic but at some point in 2021, my left ear was hurting so badly that it was painful for me to walk around so I got to see an audiologist once, at least. She only said my ear was just irritated and used a tool to clean my ear. I thought that was the end of the story because I can still perfectly hear just fine both ears, but ig not.

Going back to a normal classroom, I have a hard time participating in physical activities and games, can't ask for help when I don't understand something, conversing with my friends in real life to the extent i ignore them and prefer online messaging. The voices get way too muffled or quiet for me, especially when the person is far away from me.

It's driving me insane.

I tried telling my parents about it and they don't believe me. I'm genuinely desperate to feel 'normal' again so I'm resorting to doing this behind their backs after I found a perfect audiologist clinic to book an appointment for minors, should I?

[댓글]
I am assuming you're in the USA, so if you're not, I apologize. If you're not, I'd have to change my answer a little bit based on the country. 

Either way, I'm sorry your parents won't believe you. That's frustrating. 

You might also want to look into having the audiologist test for auditory processing disorder too. This can manifest in issues with understanding speech and some of the things you've described. (Google it to learn more.) 

 I'm wondering how insurance would work with this though, because your parents may end up with a bill. I'm wondering if maybe talking to a teacher or even school nurse/counselor for them to try to convince your parents you're having issues and need to be tested could help. Or writing them an email and including that you'd like to be tested, because sometimes people are more open to things when they've had a chance to read and process it. 

 Otherwise, I hope the clinic you found takes your health insurance, as unfortunately audiology can be extremely expensive 😔

Good luck! You do deserve to have your hearing tested.

Assuming you are in the USA and under 18, the audiology clinic will not see you without parent consent. There are only 3 types of medical care protected for minors: mental health, sexual health, and trauma/serious injuries. Hearing loss does not fall under those classes so the audiology office will need parental consent and the insurance company will not keep anything confidential.


Do you have a regular pediatrician or primary care doctor that you see? They might be the best person to talk to your concerns about. They can advise your parents that you are having a real problem and need to see an audiologist. In my experience people unfortunately trust the doctor more than their kid. They can also document if your parents are refusing to give you recommended medical care. If this is a pattern for them you might have legal options. Otherwise speak to someone you trust at school like a teacher or counselor.


I'm really sorry that you are struggling with this and that your parents are the ones who don't know how to listen to your concerns. Especially because this is affecting your well-being and accessibility. If you want to browse around on this subreddit a lot of people talk about accommodations that help them which you might be able to implement in your day to day life. Best of luck.

Yes, go see a doctor.

1l3pbam,deaf,Desperately need advice,"I feel like I'm going crazy because I've been having these issues for almost two years now and I'm just so stressed and upset and confused.

So I got my Resound Nexia Hearing aids around October of 2023. My entire family on my mother's side has hearing issues so it did not come as a surprise at all and I was so excited. This light had apparently just come out and my audiologist was like this will be perfect for you.

Right after I got them I was determined to follow my audiologists advice and get my brain use to them. I was wearing them to work, to family events, on errand runs. I was keeping them clean and dry and changing the filter regularly. But after a couple months (well after the return period), one of them started sounding...idk quieter? Like I was starting to have trouble hearing again because it would get so quiet. It got to the point where I could hear people better without the hearing aids.

So I took it to the audiologist and she sent it out for repairs. It came back and were completely replaced by resound and yeah they worked great. Problem solved right? Nope! It happened again just a month or two later in the other side this time. Same thing, everything just got progressively quieter and I had more and more trouble hearing. So I take it back and the same thing happens.

And it just keeps happening. Every few months, I'd have to take one or both back to the audiologist to get sent out for repairs. I asked multiple times what was wrong but whenever they get sent out the entire thing just got replaced. My audiologist once specifically requested a diagnostic report (which took an extra week) and again, the innards were just completely replaced and I was never informed of the diagnostic.

I just don't understand why or how this is happening. I keep them in my bedroom where it's dry and not messed with by anyone. My hair is short and dries quickly so I never put them on before my hair is dry and I don't use product or anything that might be clogging the mics. Even if there was something clogging the mics, I clean them diligently with a soft toothbrush. I work in a school with middle schoolers but none of them touch my hearing aids. It might be sweat but I was told I shouldn't worry about that.

Even now, they sound so quiet even when I turn them all the way up. I've asked if maybe my hearing is getting worse and I was told no it couldn't be that it's a technical problem. We have tried disconnecting and repairing and reprogramming and we still don't know what's happening.

I'm sorry for rambling but I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this before because my warranty is going to expire soon and I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to hear my students at work and my partner sitting on the other side of the couch and I can't do that because it feels like I'm just wearing super expensive ear plugs. I'd get that if it was right at the beginning of wearing them but it's been two years. I wear them every day for minimum 8 hours even when I'm not working.

Please I just need someone to tell me what I can do at this point because I can't afford just getting a different brand.

[댓글]
I have the Jabra Enhance Pro 20s from Costco, which are the equivalent of the Nexias. My first thoughts would have unfortunately been moisture, debris in the microphone cavity, and your hearing in general; as you mentioned, it's very likely not tied to any of these factors. Are these RICs (wired with the receiver on the end) or BTEs (tubing)? I had the RIC variant for a while before I moved over to the PBTE, and I had a similar issue that was tied to the receiver wire. I remember I had to lightly ""tug"" at the area where it's plugged into the HA occasionally in order to solve the issue temporarily until I was set up with a replacement receiver wire. They might be swapping the HA, but keeping that same faulty receiver. After moving to the PBTE, I've never had this issue again.

I have been wearing HA's for over 25 yrs and from what you are saying it seems like you are doing everything right. I am now wearing Signia BTE brand but have used Resound in the past (I'm disabled vet so they are supplied to me, I don’t choose). The most common reasons I have experienced what you describe is when the RIC goes bad, a plugged dome or batteries close to being worn out. These don't sound like the cause of your issues though. Your audiologist would be able to solve these issues while you wait in the office. They usually only go back to the mfr when they have a bad processor. It is normal for the mfr to just replace the processor and send back out if under warranty also, you don't get much in the way of a report from them. It is NO way normal to have to do this every couple months. I would start asking the audiologist what the process is to get your money back or simply swap to another brand but either way you need to see what your options are while they are still under warranty. Don’t give up on the idea, just stay on your audiologist to help you with this. They are your voice to the mfr and you paid them a lot of hard earned money for a set of hearing aids that should last, IMO this is not on you.

Do you put them in a dehumidifier at night? You didn't say.  I put my older model Resounds in dessicant jar at night. Going on 5 years and never failed.",2025-06-05 03:33:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l3pbam/desperately_need_advice/
1l3lya0,deaf,OSHA hearing protection regulation dispute,"So… a stupid and uneducated legal regulation is being enforced on me.

I’m deaf, with a cochlear implant on both sides. I haven’t been wearing hearing protection at my part time job for this reason. The noise level is above 85 decibels, but not that high. I cant hear anything. The other day, OSHA walked through and noticed I wasn’t wearing ear protection. They weren’t happy, and they sent a letter to my boss to make me wear ear protection and take HEARING TESTS. They said even though I’m deaf I still have some level of residual hearing. That’s false. I have NO level of residual hearing as I am a bi-cochlear implant patient. All of my hearing was destroyed when I had surgery on both my ears. My boss is going to fight the false claim that I have some level of residual hearing  and do everything in his power to make sure I’m not subject to hearing tests. If all goes well, I won’t have to take the hearing tests or wear ear protection, and legally speaking I’m not required to. OSHA is uneducated when it comes to my specific category of cochlear implant patients and it’s absolutely ridiculous. Subjecting me to a hearing test feels like an insult and is discriminatory, and under no circumstance should anyone in my position ever have to take a hearing test given they have no residual hearing. Big L.

[댓글]
Of course OSHA wants to enforce it. Time for malicious compliance. If I had zero hearing, I would look the Aud tech in the eye while not pushing the button. 

The last time I needed an audiogram for the hearing conservation program, they had to stop the test because my headphones were loud enough that other people were hearing it and pushing their own buttons. My Aud gave me a letter saying that I don’t need to be part of the program because she was monitoring my hearing.

I bet the only reason the guy didn’t use common sense is because there were no other violations to ticket.

Got curious and found the following:   

OSHA's regulations for cochlear implants focus on protecting employees' hearing in noisy workplaces, not on providing specific guidance for individuals with implants. OSHA's hearing conservation program requires employers to provide and ensure proper use of hearing protection for all employees exposed to noise levels above 85 decibels (dBA). While this program is primarily designed to prevent hearing loss, it also benefits workers with pre-existing hearing loss, including those with cochlear implants.

I’m sure once it’s documented, it’ll be fine.  

Good Luck!

I’ve memorized and disputed a ton of OSHA’s dumb rules i mean just look their ladder restrictions and rules. As dumb OSHA is they’re gonna get you for not wearing ear protection regardless of your reason. It’s just what they do. They wrote me up once for no reflective vest when i was on a roof alone and another time for being contractor not taking lunch with the construction crew.

Fight them based on the fact that they’re overstepping their job descriptions and practicing medicine without a license; that’s an actual crime, BTW.

IANA ENT/audiologist, but are you not still susceptible to vestibular damage due to extremely loud noise? Mechanically, the ear is still doing the ear thing, even if the bypass for sound awareness, kwim?

If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but that's still not the issue OSHA is presenting you with - they're totally nuts for that one.

I’m fairly certain an annual hearing test is legally required. I do one every year for my job. I could be wrong but I don’t think there is an out.

You still have to follow it to be within compliance with OSHA. The standards for hearing loss prevention in OSHA was made in the 80’s and have not been updated. I know it sucks but if you don’t follow it, your employer may let you go. Being fined by OSHA gets expensive.

OSHA only requires that an employer offer hearing tests annually for employees in the HCP. If your employer doesn't require it, you may decline the testing.  
[https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1995-01-23-1](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1995-01-23-1)  
  
""Finally, you asked if an employer can force an employee to take annual audiometric tests as part of their proactive approach to control occupational or nonoccupational hearing loss.  
  
OSHA's Noise standard requires only that audiometric testing be made available to all employees whose exposures equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 dBA. On the other hand, the standard does not prohibit an employer from having a company rule that employees submit to audiometric testing.""",2025-06-05 00:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l3lya0/osha_hearing_protection_regulation_dispute/
1l3jofl,deaf,Blind coworker and screen readers ...,"Hi All, I'm late deafened, but still pick up noise, and use folks verbalizations to let me know I need to look at the closed captions when I'm on a zoom call (I'm learning ASL, but its been a rapid journey and I still work in a mostly hearie environment).

This normally works, but sometimes I end up on a call with someone using a screen reader (I have a blind coworker who uses one, and also outside vendors) and it is this total assault on what hearing I have left. 

Any tips for dealing with this? I could bow out of these, or just only use captions, but this would be a less than optimal choice as my role, and company culture is very interactive.

Is it just the Zoom call picking up their computer reading out the screen aloud at their end? If that's the case, could they perhaps use headphones on the call with you so the screen reading doesn't get picked up?

Or is it Zoom playing their computers system sounds when they're presenting? That may be a harder issue to resolve since Zoom won't be able to distinguish between the screen reader and any sounds that are meant to be shared (video in a presentation etc).

I think it's définatly appropriate to ask if they can use headphones or mute their sound when not talking",2025-06-04 22:54:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l3jofl/blind_coworker_and_screen_readers/

Via Google translate: 

We were taking a sign language test and we got into a discussion about one of the questions:

What is the main advantage of bilingual education for the deaf? a) Improving the academic performance of the deaf b) Facilitating communication between the deaf and the hearing c) Promoting the social inclusion of the deaf d) Stimulating the development of the Portuguese language in the deaf

According to the teacher, the correct alternative was letter D, but the entire class concluded that the correct alternative was letter C. The logic was that stimulating the development of the Portuguese language was a process with the aim of promoting social inclusion, which would be the main advantage of this type of education.

I would like to ask for the perspective of more people, or even someone who is deaf, thank you in advance.

The only realistic answer is ""all of the above"" 
You are both wrong. 

A única resposta realista é ""todas as opções anteriores"".
Vocês os dois estão errados.

The main advantage is maximizing access to language period. Some deaf people perform better socially and/or academically in signed language, while others perform better socially and/or academically in spoken or written language. Remove signed language from the equation and those who need it will suffer. Remove spoken/written language and those who need it will suffer. 

D could have been correct only if Portuguese had been taken out, leaving only “language.” But as surdophobe said, the only logical answer (if you’re considering deaf people as real individuals rather than thought experiments) is “all of the above.” 

As it stands, the question and its answers are coming from a very oralist, Alexander Graham Bell perspective, in that he believed signed language should be used in deaf children’s education only until they sufficiently acquired spoken language and could then be integrated in hearing society. (See, for example, *Never the Twain Shall Meet* by Richard Winefield.)

Google Translate: 

A principal vantagem é maximizar o acesso à linguagem. Algumas pessoas surdas têm melhor desempenho social e/ou académico na língua gestual, enquanto outras têm melhor desempenho social e/ou académico na língua falada ou escrita. Retire a língua gestual da equação e aqueles que dela necessitam sofrerão. Retire a língua falada/escrita e aqueles que dela necessitam sofrerão.

A opção D só poderia estar correta se o português tivesse sido retirado, ficando apenas ""linguagem"". Mas, como disse o surdofóbico, a única resposta lógica (se considerar os surdos como indivíduos reais e não como experiências mentais) é ""todas as alternativas anteriores"".

Tal como está, a pergunta e as suas respostas provêm de uma perspectiva muito oralista, de Alexander Graham Bell, na qual acreditava que a língua gestual deveria ser utilizada na educação das crianças surdas apenas até que estas adquirissem suficientemente a língua falada e pudessem então ser integradas na sociedade ouvinte. (Ver, por exemplo, *Never the Twain Shall Meet*, de Richard Winefield.)

The family is also bilingual in English and Spanish (parents &amp; siblings are fluent in both). The parents are not sure how to go about teaching and learning signs. Both sides of the family are willing to learn, but some don't speak English and some don't speak Spanish. 

  
Do you have suggestions on which sign language to use? Everyone kind of feels that leaning/teaching (technically) 4 languages at once, is too overwhelming (English, Spanish, ASL, &amp; LSE). 

We have a large hoh/deaf community we work &amp; connect with for these families, but this is a more unique situation. I'll also be posting this on the ASL subreddit to get opinions on that front as well. 

  
Thank you for any advice or resources you may have. 

[댓글]
Since you have experience with the Deaf community, I am sure you already know this, but just for clarity: ASL is not just the sign language version of English, nor is LSE the sign language version of Spanish (it is the sign language used in Spain). Whatever is the most common signed language in your area (I'm assuming ASL) will be most useful to the Deaf child so they can integrate with their local Deaf community.

I live in an area where several Deaf families are ASL-Spanish-English trilingual or ASL-Spanish bilingual. Mano a Mano is an excellent resource for ASL/Spanish/English trilingual interpreters, and I know their website has resources for learning ASL for Spanish-speaking people.

Seconding RoseyPosiePie’s comment. Start with the sign language used in where the family lives. LSE is used in Spain, so if the family doesn’t live there, then it’s not the right sign language to learn. Other Spanish-speaking countries don’t use LSE. For example, Mexico has its own sign language, LSM. It’s the same thing as ASL vs BSL vs Auslan, despite the countries all using English as their primary spoken language.

I was raised with English and Apache spoken regularly and fluently by my family. 

Because we live in America, I learned ASL (I also learned native sign language for my tribe later). 

I also had family in Australia so AUSLAN was later added. 

As it's been pointed out, you want kiddo to learn the sign language of the region they're in. 

Assuming you're in the states, that would be ASL even if the family speaks a different language. 

If the family plans to visit another area you can work with learning that Sign Language as well, but in my opinion, it would be secondary to the primary sign language the child needs to function and receive proper language.

You've not told us where you live... which makes this hard to answer.


The SL to learn is the SL of your country. This will put them in touch with their Deaf community in their local area. 


Treat a second SL like an additional language. So Eng + Esp + ASL + LSE is 4 whole languagws - not two.


Also - remember that SLs are tied to communities, not to languages. So ASL and BSL are the SLs of the Deaf communities is America+Canada and Britain respectively - even if both are neighbours to English. Similarly LSE and LSM are the SLs of Spain and Mexico - even if both are neibours to Spanish.


If they do want to learn a second SL - make it the one of a country they actually have relatives in and travel to. So if they have relatives in Spain but not Mexico, then LSE not LSM. But if its Argentina then they should be learning LSA. Try to find the kid Deaf connections in said country.

Focus on ASL and LSE for the child first. The speech will come a lot easier if the language development has a chance to work first. 

As for the family, whoever knows only Spanish, ask them to just focus on learning LSE. Whoever knows only English, learn ASL. If anyone knows both spoken languages, they can consider their home country as priority (assuming the family is spread in both countries, giving the child access to both Deaf communities in ASL and LSE. ) 

Linguistic research found that if the adults around the children just picked one language (ASL/eventually English too OR LSE/eventually Spanish) to speak to the child with, and keep a strict boundary against changing the language; it will create “Bowls” to hold the Vocabulary Soups of any language. Maybe the Spanish native parent revert to Spanish or LSE only at home. Then the English parent uses English or ASL. 

The idea there is to limit confusion but maintain both sign languages equally. Eventually, as the child becomes literate, it will aid speech development for as far as they can take it individually. 

The latest Bilingual/Bimodal Deaf generation has proven it can work. Just use the Bowl of Soup method and stick to it. Introduce the child to the other relatives, and they too will practice sign with the child. First, you create a connected family, then you prepare the child to navigate their communities.

INFO: what country are you located in? 

If you're in the US, use ASL. It can be annoying, but learning the Spanish words for the signs is easier than trying to learn another signed language you do not know (I'm assuming English is your primary language, based on your post)

Mexican sign language is totally different from Spanish sign language. American sign language is totally different from British sign language.

You should use whichever is most common in your region.

Is the child school aged yet? I work with deaf kids in SoCal and I'd say at least 1/4 of the families are bilingual in English-Spanish (if not trilingual with ASL, or Spanish-only), and the child learns ASL, super common. The recommendation is to have ASL access as soon as possible to prevent language deprivation. There's also resources for Spanish speakers to learn ASL. English isn't a prerequisite to learn ASL.",2025-06-04 16:13:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l39nb8/asl_lse_or_both/

Hi Mom Friend! In my 40's, deaf, kids just reached adulthood. It's awesome but I do miss the fun and enthusiasm of younger kids. I love reading and gardening and would like to love cooking but if I'm really honest with myself, I hate it. I grew up in a small place and between that, a homestead and 3 kids, I can understand not having the time to get out much. What's the last good book you've read? I recently read the Fourth Wing series as my daughter was into it.

I feel you!  I’m located in Ohio, mom of 2 teens.  But I’m a bit older- mid 40s. Good luck, and just get out and volunteer when you’re able to.  Connect with deaf resources locally and attend Deaf events.

Hi! I wish you lived in Philadelphia! I’m looking for Deaf mom friends as well. 

I’m 35F. I love to read books, watch Tv/movies, go on bike rides with my kids… (though that’s on hiatus with my newborn daughter who’s 5 weeks old. My son is almost 2.5 years old). I love to eat baked goods… I just don’t have the patience to make it. I have a dog (such a cuddle bug) and unfortunately, my 2 cats have crossed the rainbow bridge.

You think it was a great idea? Really? Did it look like it worked based on that video? No, it clearly didn't. It was a terrible idea on her part because those kinds of creeps aren't deterred by it at all. In fact, many of us know they fetishize the idea of hooking up with a deaf girl to brag about it (see Tucker Max's ""I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell""). This even happens to us deaf guys sometimes too with women fetishizing us too, fawning over us, and touching us inappropriately without consent. This isn't gross macho bragging, it's real and it's awkward and uncomfortable as hell most of the time.

No, we're not broken. No, you can't ""fix"" us. And no, we're not a damn Hearing Savior trophy.

A true creep will continue to be a creep even if someone’s deaf. The men who can’t take no for an answer should do better so no one has to even attempt things like this.

Deaf people are actually more susceptible to experiences of violence and abuse than hearing people. Pretending to be deaf to avoid harassment is a really bad idea.

I think it’s a bad idea. It’s not awesome for us but also… ineffective and the potential to be seen as an easy target and stalked back home goes waaaaayyyyy TF up.

This is anxious behaviour rather than self-helpful behaviour. The self-help behaviour would’ve been a “no” or “GTFO of here” since she’s not alone. Notice here she’s not even considered to be worth communicating directly with because they think she’s deaf. One shitty friend or acquaintance and they get her info.

same problem I have with trans people telling people they're intersex instead to protect themselves from harassment - disabled people have a crazy high rate of DV, sa, and violent assault, like other people mentioned if they think you're deaf they might think you're an easy target because you're disabled and/or fetishize your disability.

She doesn't need to pretend to be deaf. It gives a message that we are unwanted

Being deaf has never stopped people from being creepy to me. It didn’t stop me being assaulted either. And besides, half the time people don’t even believe I’m deaf anyway. Pretending to be deaf is a bad look and there’s not really a good reason to do it. I guess if it helped her be safe, fine? But surely there’s a better way?

Didn't seem to work that well.

I'm deaf, but hey, I do wear cochlear implants. BUT sometimes when my batteries die and didn't have any extra - I will let them know, and they will SPEAK LOUDER to me and I said, no no, I mean I can't hear you! I'm DEAF! I mean..  it just makes me laugh and be annoyed at the same time. After I say that, they immediately stop talking and hurry things up so they can move on to the next customer.

When her safety is threatened, they will realize she faked being deaf. That will not have a good impact on actually deaf women.

It doesn't work. So she's getting absolutely no benefit (apart from TikTok ~content~) and potentially making it harder for actual deaf people.

No. It’s never okay.

I mean I get it as a woman, but it’s hard to not be offended by this as a deaf person.

Absolutely not. And like the video shows it doesn't even work",2025-06-03 22:29:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l2pg5p/pretending_to_be_deaf_to_be_left_alone/
1l2mtuu,deaf,Pet sitting job etiquette,"Hi! I just have a few questions about how best to having a deaf pet sitting client. I met with her today, and while I feel we were able to communicate well job today, I know it could have been better on my end. 
I had some trouble understanding her and my pet sitting job isn’t until October. Should I try to learn some ASL in the mean time or would it come across as weird/rude if I didn’t know ASL when we met today and I meet her again in a couple months and do know some? She did occasionally sign things to me, and while I don’t know much beyond the alphabet I did recognize them as signs I had seen before but didn’t know the meaning of. Is there something else I should do/practice to better understand her? She didn’t bring it up, so I am not sure if by doing that I would be acknowledging something she doesn’t want to talk about or implying I thought her ability to communicate was lacking and not mine. Her not mentioning it also makes me nervous about asking her directly what she prefers/needs. 
I am also wondering if I should be doing more demonstrate I do understand what she says, and if so what the best way to do that is? I was nodding along with her as she spoke and I tried to give responses that indicated I knew what she said, especially because what we were talking about regarded the safety of her pets, but I want to make sure that was the best choice and not demeaning? 
I guess I am just worried in my effort not to offend her I will swing in the opposite direction and be overly accommodating and equally offensive.

I'm a Deaf/hard of hearing professional cat sitter and boarder. How long is the sitting job? If it is like a month, maybe learn some basic ASL and follow the first several lessons on [lifeprint.com](http://lifeprint.com) (free). If later you become friends with the client, you could consider taking a community or college ASL class and immerse yourself in the Deaf community (still worth considering as you have 4 months before the job, but not necessary). If it's a brief sitting job like a few days, you could learn the alphabet (practice fingerspelling with als.ms) and some basic signs. Be sure to follow Deaf-created content on You Tube and ASL apps. Non-native signers can make mistakes.  In my case, I (1) do a meet and greet with the cat-owner clients and cats before the job (2) ask them to print detailed instructions (3) be sure to have a neighbor or family member as a backup contact 4) text back and forth and send updates and pictures of their pets- they love that.

You’re overthinking it. Just have her email the instructions. You can just text or write things down if needed. Depending on what kinds of pets they are you might want to ask if they sign or respond to spoken instructions. (My dogs don’t respond as reliably to spoken instructions, for example. They’re very quick to respond to signs though.)

1l2es2s,deaf,My adult sister is being overly encouraged to do speech pathology despite communicating excellently. Should I be concerned?,"My younger sister, who is an adult, is disabled in multiple invisible ways. However, the only disability that is immediately noticable is based in her speach. While she does have what I would describe as the slight charactaristically deaf style of speaking, its incredibly clear compared to other examples I've found of people who are prefectly well adjusted and even on TV. 

My concern is that as this part of her disabilities is more noticable, it seems to be concentrated on by other family/carers, despite her other disabilities being much much more impactful on her internal experiences. 

She was 80% deaf or so for most of her childhood until she had gromets put in and did receive a bit of assistance learning to talk but it wasn't particularly excessive and seemed to work well. She has risidual minor deafness now but knows how to handle it. Goes to uni, does social things, no real issues with it, and she has no complaints or even accomodations for it.

I was hoping to get some perspectives from those who are deaf and who could understand the situation better than myself. Am I being a bit too protective? I would hate for her limited time she gets receiving medical care to be put towards something that otherwise doesn't cause her distress. I mean fuck, she could just join a toastmasters club if she wanted some elocution practice, but its not really relevent to her being able to live well if it isn't causing her distress or isolation.

If its not on, are there ways I could give her some phrases to tell people to fuck off about it that are deaf specific? I'm physically disabled myself, but with no sensory impeedments, so I'm not really able to talk about it as eloquently,

Wait, hold up, she’s not getting accommodations?

I think that might be a bigger issue here.

first thing, if she wants accommodations in uni, she should speak with the disability office to ensure accommodations are in place! I am DHH and lecture halls were HORRID for me without accommodations. I was able to receive first row seating in all my classes and professors had to either have captions on any videos or provide me transcripts for videos. made college so much more accessible for me. I am also autistic and ADHD, with a math learning disability, so I qualified for extra time on tests (only needed for math) and could take tests in a private area if needed. even if she doesn't think she needs accommodations right now, it might be worth it for her to meet with the disability office to get on their radar in case anything comes up.

secondly, whether she wants to do speech pathology is her choice! as well as likely her paying for it! speech therapy is not easy and if she doesn't see a need or want for it, she doesn't need to go through it! she is an adult and can make her own decisions, and people need to respect her choices!

This may be an unpopular opinion, so take it as you will and I'll gladly accept downvotes if they come. 

Your sister is an adult. 

Don't ask us what SHE NEEDS. 

Ask her what SHE NEEDS. 

After that, help her advocate for herself and on her behalf is necessary. 

I'm also in agreement with mundane about accommodations. 

It appears she's been mainstreamed and your parents want her to be as ""normal"" as possible, which is why they're pushing for SLP. 

I think it's great you're looking out for your sister and want her best interest to come first, but don't allow your thoughts and opinions to outweigh hers. 

So in my thoughts your first move should be discussing this issue with her and not Reddit. 

You can share your thoughts with her and then listen to her thoughts. 

If she adamantly does not want SLP help her make this known to the people pushing it.

Is English her primary language or sign?

Speech therapy is more than just ""speaking well"" like toastmasters. 


She's an adult, unless she has a learning disability she can make choices about speech on her own, if she does have learning disabilities then it matters how severe and it might be to to her caregivers to determine what is best for her.

I'm speaking from the perspective of someone in the same boat, as you said, perfectly well adjusted, etc. It's easy for people on the outside to see someone coping with a challenge like this and think they are doing perfectly well, when in reality, all of that stuff - social things, etc - is so much more work than someone without a hearing loss. It's doable and it's still fun, but it is such a challenge. Your brain works harder, you are less confident than you could be, you always feel a little (or a lot!) outside of every conversation. And if you're not used to asking for accommodations because everyone assumes you're fine, it's even harder to acquire things that could really help. I wouldn't turn down speech therapy even though I live in the hearing world and have no deaf accent, because every little bit helps, but I would never join a Toastmasters club haha. Talk to your sister and let her make her own decisions without assuming how she feels about it all.

I'm a CODA and speech therapist. What does your sister want? If she wants additional speech therapy herself, then an SLP can help, but if she is happy with her speech and others are being a bunch of prejudiced jerks, then they can go screw off.

\&gt; are there ways I could give her some phrases

She's an adult so ""fuck off"" is a valid phrase. 

\&gt; its incredibly clear compared to other examples I've found of people who are prefectly well adjusted and even on TV.

What does this mean?  I think this is a case of how poor representation hurts, but maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to say. 

So her hearing loss is mostly conductive? does she have hearing aids or has she considered getting a BAHA, does she want one?  If she's going to do speech thereapy she should maximise her hearing ability.  I'm post lingually deaf so I've never had speech therapy but as person who's almost completely deaf (100% on the left nearly 100 on the right) speech therapy must be a special kind of hell for a lot of deaf or hoh children. 

You're seeing second hand is something that's pretty common.  There's a very strong speaking bias out there in the hearing world. All the people who comment on her needing to improve her ability to speak aren't worried about her quality of life, they're worried about her appearing more ""normal"" 

Other comments have already asked, but what's all this about her lack of needing accommodations? The two of you may have some internalized ableism.  In the same way a wheelchair user isn't ""wheelchair bound"" accommodations for communication are empowering and liberating.  For example a captioned phone system allows me to make my own damn phone calls and not rely on others to call for me. It's the year 2025, tech is so much better than when I was your sisters age, there is zero reason she shouldn't get exactly what she needs for equal access.

No accommodations? Definitely encourage her to get accommodations in place, you don't know how much having your lecture notes done for you,  so you can pay attention and interact/ absorb material IN class, makes a difference until after the fact. 

Otherwise, if your sister is thinking like an adult and advocating for herself like an adult, then just ask her why she wants to do speech therapy and have a real discussion with her about why she thinks she needs it, or if she feels pressure to do it.

Are you in the US? 

If so, your state’s Office of People with Developmental Disabilities (or similarly named Department) could be of assistance. They do things like coordinate services (if desired), help people with advocacy efforts, help families set up advanced directives and other plans for a person as their families/carers age, etc.

What does your sister want? Does SHE have any issues with her speech? If she doesn’t have any problem with it, then there’s no reason for her to be in therapy. She’s an adult. It’s up to her. It’s only her opinion that matters.

Does SHE want speech therapy?

1l29v7l,deaf,So bizarre… there’s no Korean subtitles on a Korean show I like on the Korean Netflix,"I’m really liking a show called “Ghost Doctor” and it makes me want to learn Korean, so I used my VPN to check out the Korean Netflix. They used to *only* have Korean subtitles, but when I checked again only a couple days later, now the subtitles are in English and Japanese…? What the f*ck, am I right? 

I feel for you Deaf and HoH Koreans. I didn’t know you had to deal with that BS on your Netflix. On the U.S. Netflix, absolutely every show I’ve come across has English subtitles. I just hope the Deaf and HoH Koreans who want to watch “Ghost Doctor” know English and/or Japanese on top of Korean Sign Language and Hangul/Korean grammar rules and stuff. 

I’m a hearing person and I can’t even imagine how frustrating a lack of subtitles can be when you *need* them. 

[댓글]
\&gt;  On the U.S. Netflix, absolutely every show I’ve come across has English subtitles.

That wasn't the case until the CVAA and then for imported or original content until after NAD vs. Netflix.

Netflix blamed the fact that they were using flash instead of MS Silverlight at first, then when they switched to MS Silverlight they blamed it on the fact that they were using MS Silverlight.  It was lies all the way down.  Netflix has also been known to source subtitles from torrents and/or OpenSubtitles without any editing.

Anyway I'm not too shocked that Netflix dropped the ball here. I wonder if the original content in Korea was captioned for broadcast. The captioning requirements in Korea are not quite as good as those in the USA.

Edit to add:  Also for Squid Game season 1 in the USA, it took MONTHS before the English parts had subtitles/captions.

A deaf Korean here. I just checked it and it showed the Korean one. I don't see the japanese and english version so I presume you set the location wrong-probably to Japan. It could happen when using VPN. Never seen nor heard any shows on Korean Netflix not having Korean subtitles unless some comedy or variety show series are on the local TVs recentlyso they didn't have time for the subtitles and uploaded on Netflix. In that case, it takes some time to be added

VPN setting is wrong.  My deaf Korean co-worker/good friend also uses VPN to connect to Korean Netflix and he always has Korean subtitles for Korean language shows. He says they aren't always perfect representations, but fully understandable.",2025-06-03 11:50:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l29v7l/so_bizarre_theres_no_korean_subtitles_on_a_korean/
1l22jw2,deaf,How accommodating should I be of her disability / should I care?,"(TLDR at the bottom) Hit it off with this girl over hinge and have been chatting for a bit. Went on the first date today and she was super funny and arguably out of my league looks wise. 

It was good vibes. I spent an enormous amount of money on food she didn’t eat though (she did eat two pieces of cheese and part of a cracker though). But that’s irrelevant. 

I show up like 15 minutes early and she says she’s running late so I hop on a meeting that I originally cancelled. She shows up, I end the meeting and greet her. We start talking order some drinks and get some food. I noticed like a little bit of a lisp, I didn’t think anything of it and quickly got used to it. 

She asked me a question while I was chewing and I covered my mouth to answer and she couldn’t hear me so I repeated myself like 3 times and then I just swallowed and finally answered. Then she said “oh yeah by the way I read lips I’m deaf”. And I was like HUH??? (In my head) and was pretty shocked but thought she was joking …. We laughed about it and she said she thought it would be funny to not tell me beforehand. It was a good laugh. I asked I should talk slower but tried to say it in a way that didn’t make her feel weird. She said it’s fine. I talk REALLY fast.  

She has hearing aids but I guess like didn’t wear them in both ears for whatever reason and we were sitting across from each other. 

Later on we were joking about therapy and I said “yeah honestly as a man, I don’t believe in therapy” and sip my martini (re last post).  Some lady walked by just in time, heard it, laughed and said a funny comment. I laughed and my date kind of chuckled but afterwards she asked me what she said. I told her and she laughed as if she understood. 

We left and went for a walk and it became more obvious that like if I wasn’t next to her ear or my lips in view of her it was difficult for her to pick up on what I was saying. But she wouldn’t ask me to repeat myself and just like pretended she got it. 

We got home and texted and she asked me what the woman said that walked by. Confused I asked her “I already told you did you not understand me before”.  She said no and that she didn’t want to make me repeat myself again because she knows it can be annoying.  

**TLDR: deaf girl didn’t tell me she’s deaf, found out mid date, kind of feel really bad I didn’t pick up on it. I’m wondering if I should not care or if I should be accommodating without her asking**

**QUESTION:** Do I need to / should I speak slower without her asking me to? Should I pronounce my words more clearly? Or do I just continue doing me even though she swears it’s “fine”. 

**Question 2:** Should I bring up ASL (I’m curious if she uses / knows it)? 

**Question 3:** If I start doing things in a way that like cater to her disability is that rude / demeaning if she doesn’t ask?

Locking this thread, there are ""spicy"" comments and baseless accusations abound.  OP has some good answers so, there we go.

Ask what she wants/needs. It’s kind of sweet you’re asking Reddit, but Deafness is a continuum and everyone has their own preferred way of communicating. We could all give advice about what would work for us, but that wouldn’t really help you. Sounds like you’re coming from a place of openness and I doubt she’d be unhappy with any chatting about her preferred way of communicating. Good luck!

I understand where she's coming from with the whole pretending ""to get what was said"". When I ask people to repeat themselves, it's quite often that I'll get brushed off. Lots of people will go ""nah don't worry, it wasn't important"" or give me weird looks or sigh and be annoyed. 

If you get negative responses every time you try to keep up in conversations, you eventually just stop asking. I've been told multiple times ""if you don't hear something, just ask"" and when I take people up on that offer, boom negative response. 

I can't speak for her personally, but I won't ask people to repeat themselves and will fake keeping up, until I trust someone enough to know they're not gonna be an ass and make a big deal out of being asked to repeat themselves. You guys are on your first date so it makes sense to me that she's not fully upfront about her needs, as a self protective mechanism. 

What helps is just speaking normally. I know that trying to slow down and being overly clear with your words sounds like being helpful but it's not. I find it harder to lipread when people do this because I'm used to people speaking at a normal rate, and if they change how they speak then it breaks the pattern recognition needed to lipread. 

Also it helps to not say stuff like ""didn't you catch that before? I told you already"", because it doesn't help with building trust. It's important for the other person to feel like they can ask you to repeat yourself or to ask questions without being judged. 

For specifics on how to communicate with her better, you'd need to have a conversation with her. Her preferences are unique so I can't tell you specifically what to do. Above info is just based on my experiences. But yes, it's best to not change things to cater to her just yet, since you don't have experience in what's actually helpful. I've had people who try to ""write"" on their palms entire sentences. I'll have to stand there for a min waiting for someone to finish ""finger painting"" their palms, then I go ""I have absolutely zero idea what you said. Its okay, you can talk to me"". I don't think you're gonna be as bad as the clueless old guy who tried to be helpful, but wanted to show an example lol.

My advice is: Build trust with her and let her tell you what she needs/wants in her own time. 

Asking about ASL isn't a big deal tho, but not every deaf people use ASL and honestly, a lot of people who use ASL and voice, would prefer to use voice with hearing people because you're gonna take forever to learn ASL to the point where it's not a slog to have a convo with you. Depends on her, but not a big deal to bring up. 

Godspeed, son. You got this. Love that you're asking questions and trying to figure out how to do things the right way.

Aw. This is so nice that you actually care enough to try and figure this out. 

Question 1- I would speak clearer, yes. If you speak crazy fast then yes, speaking a bit slower would help, but do NOT speak exaggerated or ridiculously slow (lol) 

You guys could also try the Ava app or live transcribe so that she can get everything you're saying via transcript. 

Question 2- It doesn't hurt to ask if she knows ASL. If she does use ASL then Lingvano is a fantastic app to learn sign from! 

Question 3- It depends on how you do it... your mileage is gonna vary. For me, I'd appreciate it if a date made sure we went to an open-captioned movie or made sure the theater had captioning glasses, or always had subtitles on, or made sure I wasn't left out in a crowd/group of people. Those are basic etiquette things for deaf people. 

Also, some Deaf people don't consider deafness a disability... it's society that makes it hard. 

As a side note: I'm kinda sad for this girl because she should be able to be forward with her needs and not just ""mask"" when she doesn't understand. It makes me wonder if she doesn't accept her deafness. Internalized audism is so real. (Audism is like racism but towards hearing differences.)

Deafness / hearing loss is often called an ""invisible"" disability bc it's not immediately obvious the person may need accommodation (unlike more visually apparent mobility aids like wheelchairs, crutches, etc). 

Question 1 - fwiw, you can ask but please take ""I don't know"" or ""I'm not sure"" as answers. Some Deaf people have a list of preferred accommodations, others may have spent a lot of time trying to blend into the hearing world, may have been denied access to accommodations previously, or may have trauma around requesting accommodations. Her accommodations may also change depending on environment, time of day, etc. E.g. you've already seen how face-to-face communication across a table was different than side-by-side communication while walking. 

Question 2 - sure.

Question 3 - see answer to question 1. There's a very fine line between altruism and performative savior behavior. She's the one who navigates 24/7 with deafness, and her deafness a singular aspect of who she is as a person. Like... If there's a second date it might not hurt to bring a notepad and a pen so you can write things down to supplement spoken communication. But bringing a transcriber with you might be overkill.

1. You should trust what she's telling you


2. Better to ask than just assuming she knows it. Just... Don't press too much if it seems like she doesn't want to talk too much about it. I'm guessing she didn't didn't tell you she was Deaf earlier bc people keep being weird at her about it, so just... Don't do that. 


3. If you are considerate, no, if you are patronising, yes. For example the difference between ""hey let's go to this restaurant instead bc it's quieter"" vs ""you can't go to that bar because it's too loud"" 


Also just, be more chill when she's asking you to repeat things. Like fair you were confused the first time, but from now on if she texts you after asking what someone says just tell her. I think it's also fine to like, be on the lookout for times she might not face understood, like if you have a server with a mask or lots of facial hair, it's probably fine to ask her if she caught what they were saying and tell her if she didn't. You can also if she'd rather you text her then repeat things if it's important, but mostly just follow what she's telling you /how she responds to things 💚

1. Definitely enunciate and make sure you're actually facing her. Assume if she's not looking, she's not understanding.  While everyone is different, it sounds like she relies heavily on lip reading. 

2. I wouldn't ask her. A good amount of people in the community don't. 

3. I think that would be nice. You should always ask for her input, but I wouldn't take her to eat somewhere the music is super loud, for example. I would think twice about sending videos that don't have captioning, and skip voice messages. Try to be in good lighting. 

Sometimes she might not get what you are saying (like the lady's comment) but will pretend to out of fear, or she may not realize that you were talking about topic A when she thought you were on C. Be patient when these things happen. Patience is probably the greatest thing a date can offer.

I’m actually more annoyed by the fact you felt the need to state you spent a huge amount of money on food but then say it’s irrelevant. Why state it then? Clearly that’s important to you, also what kind of expensive food is cheese and crackers

1l1y2vs,deaf,Celebrity romance scam in the Deaf community,"If you are not familiar with the Celebrity Romance Scam, its when someone impersonates a celebrity online to gain the trust of a victim and then manipulate them for financial gain.

The Deaf community is not immune to this scam. There is someone out there, who is fluent in ASL, who is impersonating actor Russel Harvard. This imposter has scammed a Deaf friend of mine out of at least $10,000 in 4 months. He uses an AI filter to look like the actor and sends photos from publicly available social media posts. 

This person ""borrowed"" money from my friend using Apple gift cards and attempted to have her send money via bitcoin. He told her that he loved her, they were getting married, and he turned straight for her. He insisted that she keep their relationship a secret because he is a celebrity.  

In my search for answers to convince her that she was being fooled, I have found 2 other Deaf women who have been similarly scammed by the same person. They trusted this person because they did not understand AI and fell victim because he uses ASL and knows many of the same people- the Deaf community is a small place.

PLEASE be vigilant about this scam! If you know anyone who has been similarly scammed, please let me know. My friend still has her doubts and I worry she is going to continue to send him money.

Thanks for sharing. It’s a good idea to let your friends and family know about video AI. Especially older folks. You can’t use FaceTime or live video anymore to confirm if someone is who they say they are. And AI will only get more realistic.

And this is how I found out he’s not straight.  Happy Pride.

That’s awful! Does Russell Harvard know about this?

So wait... Is the ""AI Russell"" signing? How does that work?

I know deepfakes can be made with voices and faces, but I haven't seen any with sign language.

This is a very common scam. See r/scams

Wow. Surely someone has a video recording of this?

First and foremost, thank you for bringing this to the community’s attention. Please also let your friend(s) know that I’m truly sorry this happened.

1l19lmj,deaf,Does bone conduction audio technology work with deaf users?,"I have seen some technology where audio is captured, not by ears, but by audio signal that is received through the poem and then to the brain.

  
Does it work?

  
Anyone tried first hand?

Poem?


Bone conduction still relies on a working inner ear. For people such as myself where the problem is in the cochlea, bone conduction does nothing.

Search bone conduction in this sub. There was a discussion in the comments of a post within the last couple days.

There are many different causes of Deafness. 


Most common is senseoneuro which means there is a problem somewhere between the brain and the cochlea. This isn't going to be helped by bone conduction. It might (if the problem is the cochlea and not the nerves/brain) be helped by a cochlear implant though. 


If the problem is conductive (aka, the 3 tiny bones or the eardrum) then bone conduction is likely to help.


So, maybe, depends on the person

I use it for the vibrations on my head, not for hearing. 

Helps me keep time for music.

It does if you have conductive hearing loss, this is literally what BAHAs do (bypass the non-working outer/middle ear to transmit the sound to the working inner ear), if you have sensorineural hearing loss it won't help you hear because the problem is with the inner ear or nerves not the outer/middle ear - people with sensorineural hearing loss can use bone conduction to feel vibrations though, I do this for 'listening' to music sometimes and it's great!

Depends on the type of hearing loss you have. If you have sensonurial hearing loss, no it will not work. If you have conductive loss, it may work. But if you have a mix, it also may work. It is different for everyone.

It depends. There's dozens of different types of hearing loss with different root causes. Bone conduction works for some of them, but not all of them. 

It's kind of like saying ""my car is broken, would a new tire fix it?"" That depends on if the old tire was broken, or if it was a different part.

It doesn't work for my born-deaf ear. I was born without a cochlear nerve in that ear. When I had my audiology appointment in 2024, they ""just wanted to try it"" because they'd never met someone like me (born without the nerve). I heard nothing, I felt nothing. Then they switched sides and it worked (of course) on my hard-of-hearing side.

So how bone conduction works is it vibrates the mastoid bone and then those vibrations are directly received by the cochlea, bypassing the middle and outer ear. If you have a conductive hearing loss and a functioning cochlea/neural auditory system, then your bone conduction will be fine. There actually are bone conduction hearing aids, though they aren't the most common. Because of bone conduction, most conductive hearing losses can't go beyond moderate severe.",2025-06-02 05:03:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l19lmj/does_bone_conduction_audio_technology_work_with/
1l0t0ph,deaf,As a single side deafness - im struggling putting hearing aids on,"To give context to the story, based on previous medical documentation all the doctors that my parents met when I was kids I agreed that I was born with the single side deafness. But due financial issues during my childhood, could not be provided additional support. Recently after gaining health insurance, did a full diagnostic of my body, it was confirmed that I do have single side deafness and I was given a free hearing aids. However, my doctors did say that they have had patients who have single side deafness not wear hearing aids at all (important information). Do I have tried wearing hearing aids, but when I put the part of the hearing aid that goes into my ears, it hurts my ears. I tried playing around with different size ear plugs, but nothing is working. I have been not using my hearing aids more often than using it. And my friends who do wearing hearing aids are on the side that you should wear it to prevent further hearing loss. 

I need an outside perspective on this situation, as anyone deal with it? 

[댓글]
maybe ask r/hearingaids my recommendation would be to ask your audiologist to try custom molds, and also make sure you are weening yourself into wearing the HA. Start with one hour and increase it by 15-30 minutes each day until you can wear it for longer

Try r/monohearing

This sounds like a mould issue, I’d suggest full ear moulds if you can. However this can also be an issue of getting used to the hearing aids themselves, are the tubes the right length? I also strongly suggest (if you are new to them or haven’t worn them in a long time) weaning yourself on them, start small and gradually increase the time you wear them.

Id reach out to your audiologist and ask if they can do anything to make it more comfortable. 

I'm HoH and while im not single sided my loss is far worse on one side than the other. Sometimes I can get by without hearing aids, or just with the one hearing aid on the worse side. But they do irritate the ear canal sometimes and its suuuper frustrating. Keeping them as clean as possible helps. But also different tips or molds can help and thats where an audiologist might be able to assist.

I can't wear the kind that goes into the ear canal. They hurt me. I have been using ear molds that fill my ear seamlessly and painlessly.

I'm deaf on one side and though I have hearing aid for that one side, I rarely use it. But when I do I realize how much effort I'm putting into deciphering what's going on. I can hear what I've been missing or what I would've struggled with. I hope you can find something that works, cuz it really makes a difference for the better.",2025-06-01 16:22:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1l0t0ph/as_a_single_side_deafness_im_struggling_putting/
1l0pa4c,deaf,Hearing got worse. Complicated feelings (a rant of sorts),"Hello! 24M here. I’ve got autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), which the NHS has not provided me adequate care for - but that’s not really the purpose of this post. Not that this post has a purpose, honestly. 

I’ve just got confirmation that my hearing loss (which in 2023 was moderate - severe) is, as of yesterday: now severe to profound. 

It’s weird, I’ve always been kind of at peace with my deafness - started losing hearing at 17, hearing aids since the pandemic. 

But maybe I’m not. I don’t know any d/Deaf people irl and I’m too anxious to go to my local deaf club. 

My ex learnt to sign BSL with me, but we’ve been broken up for years now. 

I’m a musician in a band, so that obviously complicates matters. 

No one in my life now shows any interest in signing, I feel so alone. 

This wasn’t meant to be so self-pitying, damn. It’s just a lot. And I don’t know who to turn to. So hi, strangers. Would be lovely to chat to people maybe in similar situations.

You guys were great and helped me to find a solution for us to communicate by recommending ""Live Transcribe"". This program works very well as long as we're not in public. Her phone mic picks up all nearby conversations and makes it very difficult to impossible for her to pick out just what I'm saying. I'm thinking that a Bluetooth directional mic would be a solution. Although I have found quite a few that are over-ear mounts, these do not work for me because I wear hearing aids and glasses as well, so I need one with a hairband-type mount.  
Do any of you know of one like that, or is there another solution for this problem?  
Thanks very much for any help you can offer.

Thanks everyone, still haven't come up with a preferred solution. it seems most of the mics require a dongle to be attached to the phone.

1kyjfye,deaf,Hearing Aid compatibility with iphone...,"hey I want to know if iphone connectivity for hearing aid is better than android.I currently use resound key hearing aids with samsung phone and the bluetooth connection often drops or either the right or left hearing aid disconnects. Is it better on iphone?

[댓글]
I’ve always had iPhone and it works pretty well. I’m not saying it never drops but it’s rare. My audiologist said iPhone is better but I know people might take that with a grain of salt.

It’s much more reliable. I had a Samsung for a year and found it dropped connection, wouldn’t update programs and wasn’t controllable from an app. 

No issues with iPhone. I have a Phonak.

I use my ReSound hearing aids with my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro. Everything works. Only thing that's wonky is switching between devices requires turning Blueooth off on one device and turning it on for the other.

I have Phonak and never had an issue with Android. Never dropped or disconected.... It only drops if I get too far, but that would happen with anything connected over Bluetooth.

I'm not sure about HAs but CIs are MFI(made for iphone) so it works smoothly with iphones. I actually switched from android to iphone 15PM for the first time because of that. It used to be so laggy or disconnects itself or drops often but not anymore.

Dropping one side or the other is probably because you put your phone in your pants pocket. I have that issue with iPhone and MFI Signia HAs.

I have a MFI (made for iPhone) hearing aid. It works perfectly and very easy to use. I have no experience with bluetooth HAs that also connect to Android because it was way cheaper to buy an iPhone and a MFI HA than a bluetooth HA that could be used with Android as well (that was an insurance level thing in my country though, so probably not comparable)

I have Oticon Real 1 Minirite BiCros hearing aids and they connect via Bluetooth to my iPhone XS. I don't need them to do anything other than send phone calls and/or media to my hearing aid. I know there's an app or something available to do more things with it, but I don't use it.

My oticons are fantastic. Never drop connection with calls or music/media.",2025-05-29 19:14:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kyjfye/hearing_aid_compatibility_with_iphone/
1kyhcxs,deaf,Masking while Deaf or HoH,"Hello! I am a person with disabilities, and I am working on making my jewish congregation more accessible. We do not have any Deaf members, but we have many members with hearing loss or who are HoH. **My question is about masks**. I am trying to get my congregation to take more covid and other airborne illness precautions. These would potentially include masks, CO2 monitors, and Far UV light.

I have had a **hard time finding really good information about the impact of masking on deaf access**. I know there are the SafenClear which cost lots of compared to other masks.

I am interested in what the deaf community (especially but not exclusively those that are covid cautious) are thinking about and doing with regard to masking (and any other airborne prevention methods). I also maintain a large list of resources about disability, etc in the Jewish community and can post that if anyone is interested.

[댓글]
Deaf person who works in healthcare here:

Masks absolutely impact access for people with hearing disabilities. Not only do they muffle voices, but they also prevent people from being able to lip-read. Now, they are extremely beneficial at preventing airborne illness. I still endorse people wearing them when experiencing respiratory symptoms, if they are positive for COVID/Flu/RSV, or if they are immunocompromised, but they will impact access.

I've worked with many clear masks. Personally, I don't like the Safe N'Clear Communicators that much. My personal preference is the Optrel clear N95: [https://optrel.us/product/p-air-clear-respirator-20-pack/](https://optrel.us/product/p-air-clear-respirator-20-pack/) . They're much more effective at preventing COVID (surgical-grade masks are not recommended anymore), and they fit better to facilitate better lipreading. Yes, they're all expensive; that's the reality of clear masks.

I also can't speak to the actual efficacy of CO2 monitors and Far UV light because I do not see them in healthcare settings (at least in the context you would probably be using them). I can recommend HEPA filters. Another way to protect your congregation would be to have virtual options to attend and ask people who are symptomatic to stay at home.

I understand masking is important. COVID made my life hell. If possible, acquire see through masks to enable lipreading. Even that isn't perfect due to fogging and noise distortion.

I am totally lost when people wear masks because I lipread, so clear ones would be the way to go.

Another thing I wanted to add is that at the synagogue, we have all of the leaders unmasked, and I'm working hard to make sure everyone uses a microphone all the time (we do most of the time but some people are worse than others!). I am also going to be advocating that we get CART for at least some services. Right now we have no deaf attendees, so I have not yet looked into sign interpreters.

I'm HOH and i wear masks, and managing my needs for the two can be very difficult. I prefer to do outdoor activities where I don't have to worry about masks covering mouths, and id prefer people keeps theirs on even if i struggle to hear. I'd rather be safe. 

Clear masks might help but they have their issues. Ultimately I would use visual cues when possible, use gestures or write things down, and have lots of patience and understanding.

Deaf and hard of hearing people like myself depend on being able to lip read. The masks muffle the sound of speech to the point that a person who is hard of hearing will not be able to understand a word you're saying. People to need to talk louder, It's that simple. You can also use a program or app that turns your speech into captions.

I'm hearing, and am an ASL student. I've masked my entire time at college, and all during ASL classes, I personally have never had issues being understood by my Deaf professors, but this could be because they're used to understanding poor and broken ASL from their students 😅

However, I make sure to really emphasize my non-manuel markers in the upper half of my face.

Nobody should be surprised they did this again.
It's just gonna be more waste with this lawsuit on a matter that shouldn't have been touched by trump's people.

1kxun1w,deaf,Poor experiences at a deaf school; feeling alienated and unseen ever since,"This was almost thirty years ago. My parents would take me to a day program for deaf children at a school run by nuns who taught ASL. Things happened there that are way too awful to get into on this subreddit. The sort of thing you’d see grown up victims talk about decades later.

The irony is that my parents agonized whether to “fix me” or just let me be (capital Deaf). By the time they pulled me out for unrelated reasons, scheduled my cochlear surgery and transferred me to mainstream school, it was too late. I was a very traumatized kid, quite possibly autistic, and my nervous system just saw danger in every possible interaction. The adults saw my bad behaviors but didn’t care about the “why”, and I was too young to articulate it for them. It didn’t help that I was born with a white streak that made me immediately visible. 

I feel like I’m the only one with this experience but it can’t be. There must be others. I really want to know if anyone here has had a similar beginning that’s shaped who they were for the rest of their life.

You're not alone. It is a travesty what you are going through.

Your story touched me deeply. Thank you for sharing. My story might be similar, but also different. I was born moderate to severe SNHL 60 years ago. Doctors advised my parents not to get me hearing aids, so I grew up with bad hearing, no ASL, mainstream school. I was bullied a lot, the “weird” kid. I was already traumatized by middle school &amp; it got worse. My older sister’s husband, an alcoholic, sexually assaulted me at 14. I descended into Hell! I finally got hearing aids, age 23. Finally realized I had been sexually abused, age 25. How much trauma can a human suffer?!? I still struggle with depression (I take medication), suicidal ideation. But I am getting better! I finally feel good &amp; proud of my deafness! I am learning ASL (I speak fluently). I accept my disability. But the scars are there. My heart goes out to you! 🤟🏻

While I don’t share this experience, I know lots of deaf folks who have similar stories. Most of those stories involving a school with a troubled past, most of those schools had religious affiliations.
Also, the white streak, is that wardenburg syndrome? I knew a kid with a super cool white streak. I was always jealous of him.
I am hoping you are able to heal.

You are definitely not alone, stay strong! Sounds like you're figuring some stuff out and understanding the why.  However, your last sentence ""I really want to know if anyone here has had a similar beginning that’s shaped who they were for the rest of their life.""  Your final shape is whatever you want to make it. Your beginning is your beginning yes, but you're still growing, learning, healing, forgiving, improving, evolving, all the way to the end of your life.

You are not alone. Someone close to me had a similar experience, but is hearing, and was largely mute for the first part of their childhood... The abuse at the Catholic schools is absolutely despicable. They should be abolished.

My story is not the same, I was HoH but somehow my parents decided I couldn’t have any issues, went without hearing aids until I was 25. At the time I was told by the ENT that they couldn’t imagine the amount of compensatory behaviors I had had to adopt to get to where I was without hearing aids, and that it must have been so hard. I was assaulted as a kid, bullied constantly, and nowadays any form of social ambiguity is read by my nervous system as danger and induces fear and anxiety, so it affects me and my social skills deeply. I’m severely medicated, and labeled as having “non-standard neurodivergence”, since I don’t fit cleanly with autism, ADHD, “giftedness”, and other categories. 

EMDR has helped me with processing stuff not a cognitive position, but from a more encarnated, lived one. I’ve come to develop more self-compassion and understanding about myself through therapy and concepts like CPTSD in these last few years, and how my limited hearing capacity has impacted it all complicates it even more, since I often feel that professionals rely on it to explain things about myself that are not necessarily due to only my difficulties with hearing. But also it’s such an important part of myself. 

Nowadays I’m more proud and confident in who I am, and I’ve dropped a lot of expectations about how I should comply and please other people that were instilled in me. That has brought me a lot of peace. It’s a difficult path to navigate since no established path seems to be the exact right one but I draw solutions from many sides, and keep going. 

You’re not the only one, and you’re more than the sum of your hurts. If anything, what has changed the most for me has been learning and experiencing in myself that I have a certain control in how much I accept what happened to determine the narrative of who I am. 

Best of luck, and lots of hugs, if you want them &lt;3

1kxrari,deaf,Closed captions on DVDs are getting left behind,"

[댓글]
Ripping DVD, that's easy. Converting CC data to subtitle for burning DVD, that seems very hard. Since CC is basically text data while DVD subtitle is bitmapped graphic.  MKV and MP4 does store subtitle data in text, not graphics but I have yet to find a way to convert CC to subtitle when making MKV to reduce file size.

I have a few DVD that are closed captioned only, no subtitle at all and quite often older or less known movies don't see a reissue so my choice are to find free Eng sub and hope the timing are correct.

I was an early adopter of the Blu-ray format.

I learned the hard way that HDMI was not capable of transmitting closed captioning (CC) signals. HDTVs couldn’t decode them because they weren’t receiving any data to decode. The HDMI technology made that impossible. It feels like this aspect was neglected in the rush to get the technology to market.

I used to write about this issue on an old blog as a way to raise awareness.

The only way to access CC was if the DVD or Blu-ray player had an internal CC decoder, but very few players had this feature. Later on, the PS3 and PS4 were updated to support CC.

Home video distributors introduced a so-called solution by offering SDH (subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing), which are image-based subtitles. It wasn’t an ideal solution because, unlike CC, it wasn’t universal.

There should have been a class action lawsuit against the industry to get this issue resolved sooner rather than later.

The damage is done, though.

Quickly - If you've got HDMI and cannot get captions working, switch to composite (RCA)",2025-05-28 20:16:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kxrari/closed_captions_on_dvds_are_getting_left_behind/

Share your symptoms.

Best to write everything down in advance so you won't forget anything.

Share all of the symptoms. Vertigo is related. Who told you it wasn't? Let the doctor decide what is and isn't related.

My dad had one very helpful advice. Share everything to your doctor. Let them decide what is relevant and what is not.

You might think the information you divulge is overkill, but the doctors will know exactly what to ignore and what to use. Even if they write everything down. They will pick and choose to match and possibly narrow down to a single cause.

Share all your symptoms. I have a chronic illness, too, and I let my doctors know about it when a symptom pops up. Let the doctor tell you it’s unrelated, and it is better to ask them than not knowing.",2025-05-28 07:22:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kxaxmq/first_ent_appointment_finallyany_suggestions/

However, I still have some hearing left through bone conduction on my left side. When playing competitive FPS games, I feel at a big disadvantage because I can’t detect the direction of sounds. I’m hoping that bone conduction headphones might help. Has anyone here used them for gaming? If so, which model would you recommend?

Shokz is the big brand, but they're pricey. The knock offs on Amazon are almost as good. 

I recommend trying a well rated $25 pair, even if the brand name looks like a keyboard smash. And if you really like them, get the fancier brand when the first pair dies. 

Accessibility is a serious problem in gaming, esp FPS games. And you really should complain to the game maker. Accessibility is good for everyone. But the publishers need to hear voices say that we want it.

I use a set of artic nova pro headphones which I bypassed EU regulations on volume controls to allow them to be turned up all the way.
They provide me with enough conduction to tell whi h side gun fire is coming from.

1kx0hrm,deaf,Struggles with hearing partner[32F] understanding my[33F] hearing difficulties. Need advice,"Hi so when I was a child I was found to have hearing loss in mid range frequencies (cookie bite hearing loss) but never got treatment for it, I think because at the time it wasn’t severe or it was just the 90s and there was little support for this sort of thing where I was. It has only gotten worse in 20s and 30s. Anyways, I still haven’t gotten any treatment due to various factors but I plan on it. This is just some initial background on my situation. 

So my cookie bite hearing loss has always made communication difficult. Frequently asking people to repeat, especially if we are walking around or are on public transit. This historically has caused a lot of friction with partners resulting in one of us getting upset. My current partner is wonderful and understanding in many ways but this has been a massive issue for us. She is one of those people who talk quiet and will do so while walking away or facing away from me. I will ask her to speak louder and repeat and her louder is loud enough or she’ll say she just speaks quietly because that’s how she is. I understand that some people are by default like that or are the opposite talk loud. But her refusal feels really insensitive and hurtful because she can talk louder but I can’t hear better. 

I’m really struggling to figure out how to get her to understand and fix because it’s really upsetting to the point that I cry sometimes and it feels the bigger the deal the more intransigent she gets as a reaction. Has anyone dealt with something similar and overcome it successfully? Is it something that would just be resolved by getting hearing aids? I appreciate any advice. 

[댓글]
I mean this in the kindest way. If she’s unwilling to change up her communication style to accommodate you…is she really the partner for you?

Time for a serious conversation.  Tell her how it makes you feel when she does this.  You may also need to train yourself to stop pretending.  You keep accommodating everyone else's lack of consideration and they'll never need to learn how to accommodate you.

So just a quick update. I talked to her and expressed my feelings and it seemed to click with her finally and wasn’t defensive. Obviously this is a long term thing so I guess I’ll report back by I’ll make sure to keep what everyone said in mind if there isn’t long term change.

From firsthand experience: if they won’t learn to accommodate you without getting defensive or retrenching in their Hearing ways, the relationship is doomed. 

That’s why we have a high fail rate for Deaf-Hearing relationships at 85%.

I divorced my husband of 28 years for various reasons, one of them being that I lost my hearing (SSNHL) and had to start wearing hearing aids, among other health issues. He absolutely refused
To slow down, face me when speaking and enunciate. He’s a trained actor/improv comedian ffs and literally refused to accommodate my hearing loss in any way. It wasn’t that he can’t, just that he won’t. My current partner has no difficulty whatsoever remembering to face me when speaking and make sure he has my attention when he wants to talk to me. He goes out of his way to include me in social situations, and “translate” as often as he needs to and he never gets annoyed, bored or irritated by any of it. 
You deserve to be with someone who gets it and doesn’t see you as a bother. Hearing aids help, but I don’t wear them 24/7, and it’s nice to be with someone who doesn’t see me as a burden. It’s not that hard in the grand scheme of things to look at people when speaking to them!

1kwzszq,deaf,Regional school for the deaf services in Texas I have some questions,"I am a high school teacher and I am deaf. But my hearing aids currently serve well enough that I can teach an agent at classroom. When I asked my region where I go to teach when my hearing aids are no longer enough they said I would teach at the regional school for the deaf. Our regional school for the deaf is housed inside of an elementary school. Our elementary schools only go to fourth grade. So those of you who went to a school like that or would know anything about it, where do the children who are deaf go when they get to junior high or high school? Do they continue to attend the regional school for the death inside of that elementary school or do they move them to a regular Jen edge of school and provide them an interpreter?

[댓글]
It depends on the person. Some will do gen ed. But a lot of programs for the Deaf are residential. Some students start there quite young, some will start going to stay in dorms when they get to junior/ high school age.

We opted to use our local public school instead of using the Regional Day School Program for the Deaf. The school we would have to use is two towns over and we decided that was too far. Unfortunately that is the only option the district is giving us if we want ASL interpreters.

In my state, the certifications for teaching general ed and DHH are two completely different certifications. You cannot get one and teach the other.

I know of many deaf and hard of hearing people that teach general ed classes. They just need to request reasonable accommodations in order to do their job.

I’d assume they probably go to Texas School for the Deaf or their local RDSPD that serves middle school and high school (it might be in the elementary building or it might not be in your district but in a nearby district) or back in gen ed with special ed services as established in their IEPs. 

I think a school district close to my area is having K-12 RDSPD in the same elementary building because that way they can have all of their DHH providers serving all grade levels in the same building, and an elementary building happened to have the space for it.

Ask the school. They will have all of that information and they will know it most accurately. It really varies. 

I work in a k-12 school for the Deaf and if I had to guess about your situation I’d guess that they get thrown into gen ed settings with interpreters and TOD services. Are you a TOD?

1kwwywk,deaf,I think ASL should be taught as a required class (if you live in the U.S.),"I’m a hearing person, but I’m learning ASL right now (or just beginning to) and ASL really should be taught in more schools. Even if you have perfect hearing, you could lose it in the future, or you might even fall in love with a Deaf person who only knows ASL. And not knowing ASL can limit your friend group because you don’t know how to properly communicate with Deaf people (unless you don’t mind writing to them all the time, but that sounds annoying). 

I can’t think of a downside to everyone knowing ASL. 

[댓글]
Agreed, but let's give deaf kids sign language access first. Less than half (likely as little as a quarter) of all deaf children in the United States get meaningful exposure to ASL before adulthood. ASL continues to be made more and more available to hearing kids while deaf kids still endure language deprivation.

Now we just need to find 75,000 qualified ASL teachers and the money to pay their salaries. /s

It’s a nice wish, but it would take a lot of work to give every high school student a semester of ASL.

It did but problem is every school think it a waste teaching asl some schools has it till close it

Yeah, let's mandate the hearies get better education than the people who don't have adequate access to their own language as it is.

We could do this by offering better pay to the skilled signers working in deaf schools so they'd come to public schools and teach mainstream classes -so long as they're not deaf.  

There are shockingly few of these skilled, trained hearing teachers so we'll have to teach more to cover all these hearing classes.   Deaf teachers aren't suitable for hearing students, btw.*   They don't get hired.    After a few years, they won't have proficiency, anyway.

This is another zoo post.     No, you hearies can't wipe out the scant resources deaf kids need to survive in the discrominatory world y'all promote.   You can't appropriate our language in advance out of fear of becoming one of us.

While we're on the subject, why not require braille for all students.   Disallow stairs in public schools.   Require a class in adaptive mobility strategies so y'all are ready for paralysis, MS, injuries.  Be equal in your preparation for the disabilities you ableds might pick up.   All this to prepare yourselves to be like us but not to include us in your society.   If the y'all were welcoming, we'd not be discussing this at all.   We'd not have needed laws or lawsuits to enforce them.

*We have been chipping away at this ignorant thinking for 50 years but are currently losing that hard-gained ground as funding and enforcement cuts spread.

Also, /angry s.

The western (English) hand number system certainly needs an update

Wow- a hearing person says the same thing all hearing people do without any understanding of depth or context and posts in a Deaf group. Groundbreaking!

I'm probably a weird case, living in a community with a large Deaf population and having a speech processing disorder, but... no.

ASL is extremely useful and I'd be in favor of most people being able to utilize it in some capacity, but actually requiring it is going to cause unnecessary problems.

There aren't enough qualified teachers and you'd have really bad instruction. There is a critical shortage in both university programs and very few certify for ASL teaching. Before you can get schools to offer ASL as a language, you need ASL as a teacher licensure with enough qualified faculty to meet the demand. 

 Additionally, schools value spoken languages over signed languages. Many states and many colleges only recognize ASL as meeting your foreign language requirement IF you are disabled.  Spanish is seen as more valuable and the population you can use Spanish with is larger.  Unfortunately, ASL doesn't even have a majority of deaf people using it as children are denied sign.

If everyone in the world learned universal sign language, images the barriers that would be lifted.

Agreed, it wouldn't hurt anyone. It would be so beneficial to the Deaf and HoH community and could have benefits for hearing people as well. I just started learning ASL a couple months ago. I made a Deaf friend and he is teaching me. I also happen to have autism. I find it really comforting to not have to add to all the world's sounds and sensory battalion that stresses my brain out by using ASL to communicate. I can't imagine how much happier I might have been if I had been able to communicate with ASL while younger. I think it is way more useful than the French I can barely speak and comprehend and I find it amazing that I can communicate with ASL better than French in a short time. I thought I was just bad at learning languages. Turns out I'm only bad at learning auditory languages and that I actually pick up visual ones like ASL fairly quickly.

I agree. All sign language anywhere should be taught. I’m currently learning ASL and JSL right now!!

hi, where are u taking asl class and how much do u pay for it?

Agreed, I'm in the uk and I really think we should learn BSL in schools instead of French or German or whatever

I’ve dated a CoDA which was a huge step in the right direction, having deaf family and experience. But especially in the area I live, It feels almost impossible to find another deaf lesbian in my dating pool. Then outside of those two logistics, there would also be the general necessity that we also have things in common and basic dating things. I would love a deaf or hard of hearing girlfriend, it just seems impossible to come by without being long distance 😫 just frustrated. Anyone else?

I've only had luck with hearing girls, and I eventually married one.  I'm post-lingually deaf though so that can make a difference.  

You seem to have a good solid definition of what you're looking for and want. You should have a list of deal breakers too, such as smoking or whatever you can't compromise on. Dating seems to get better when you get a little older, my best advice is to not seriously date anyone under 25. It's not set in stone but 25 is a bit of a magical age for people when their frontal lobes are fully developed and they think more carefully about what they want in life. 

Good luck! 

  
Also, long distance sucks terribly. I once had a rule that I'd not do long distance ever again, but, I broke that rule when I met the woman that's now my wife. So you never know.

A few generations ago I would have advised you to put an add in your local paper: FREE ASL LESSONS TO LESBIANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18-35.  I'm sure something similar could be done today with social media.

i’d encourage you participating in deaf organizations or clubs ( ie deaf pickleball, deaf basketball, etc) that way you get to connect with the deaf community and find like minded people. and who knows, you might meet someone you like!  it’s a win win.

I am also HOH, a lesbian, and can’t hear without hearing aids either. I am happily married to my hearing wife. We met online many years ago when that was still a new thing. People do exist who will take your deafness seriously. Lots of good suggestions here. My spouse and I are learning ASL together…it was her idea as I never learned, but always wanted to. Yeah, our dating pool is limited, but someone is out there.

U aren’t one in same situation . Everyone has same issue as u are .

I'm married to a hearing wife and as my hearing changed so did our relationship while she is learning some basic ASL the constant need for me to spell stuff out and teach us frustrating I feel you here :( sometimes I wish I could find someone who understands

My advice to get find deaf lesbian or HOH in deaf club or any event in your local community  ? But I am gay but easy to me find deaf gay or deaf transmen ( transition woman to man ) in urban areas example NYC or the bay area of California and Seattle Washington but many age the same your own at Gallaudet University in Washington DC but I would to live in Palm Spring California   is rural communities in my town but I live in Portland Oregon but I can traveling to anywhere in the world hang out with lgbt community

My hearing partner picked me up because I'm a very nice person. We've had no issues for five months.

He doesn't know ASL, but we communicate a lot with each other through phone. He's my local partner.

I just enjoy spending time with him.

I keep a running [list of fiction with deaf characters here](https://slacowan.com/2025/03/30/ranked-deaf-characters-in-fiction/). I always try to indicate if the character is a main character and if the author is deaf or had sensitivity readers.

The comic ‘Rune: The Tale of a Thousand Faces’ has a deaf main character and is wonderful. It’s marketed for younger readers but is enjoyable at any age (it’s worth reading for the art style alone). The main character’s deafness is viewed in a positive light, with it being an unspoken accepted and accommodated part of her character. Her ability to sign also gives her greater access to the magic of the comic’s world, with the magical “wizard speech” sharing signs with sign language. The sign language in the comic is rooted in British Sign Language but should be accessible more widely. I grew up not seeing myself represented in any media and it has been so healing having such a cool character who experiences the world in a similar way to me and is so effortlessly accepted. Highly recommend giving it a read :)

'Persistence of Vision' by John Varley is a novella that heavily features DeafBlind &amp; won a couple of SF awards.

It was written in the 1970s so while it was very advanced for its time in terms of DeafBlind independence - and that element still stand up well in the 2020s - some other things in the novella have not aged well.  

Still worth reading for a rare literary perspective on DeafBlind as problem-solvers and fixers.

Well he’s not a central or main POV character, but Tress of the Emerald Sea by Brandon Sanderson has a Deaf character.

Try r/monohearing

are you putting your phone in mono mode? that'll turn any headphones into a mono set.

I prefer earbuds that go into my ear canal, so that it blocks out outside noise, which makes the audio a bit clearer.

I have some EarFun Air Pro 3 - they're good and I got them on a big sale. But otherwise, I'd generally just send you to google for a 'best headphones' search, and include the style you like and a price range.

I was born deaf in my right ear. I just sort of lived with never hearing anything in stereo till I got my first smartphone. 

Every device I use with headphones/earbuds is set to ""mono"" instead of stereo. That way, all of the sound goes through both sides and I can hear the WHOLE song through my one semi-hearing ear.

The advice about setting headphones to mono setting is correct, and I tried a brand called Yuni headphones once that was meant to give the stereo effect but it was fairly expensive and I can't remember how well it worked before the early prototype version (this was years ago) broke because it was ""assemble by yourself upon delivery"" at the time. There might be similar brands trying similar things, mimicking hearing aids to try giving a stereo effect, but I mostly rely in mono mode and subtitles these days.

Edit: Forgot to mention that I'm also deaf in my left ear, which is why I tried the Yuni in the first place.",2025-05-26 23:15:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kw8hlz/i_was_born_deaf_in_my_left_ear_i_need_some/

1kvstoo,deaf,Frustrated with backhanded compliments,"I lost my hearing to a viral infection at around 16 and a half years old. One of the first things I noticed about wearing hearing aids is the way people talk about them. Especially people middle aged and older. I'm talking extended family, doctors, teachers, everyone. They'll always say ""wow they're so invisible, isn't this tech so great"" or ""I would never have known!"". Am I the only one who feels like this is NOT a compliment? At all? I don't want my hearing aids to be invisible! I want them to work! 

I might be literally the only person frustrated by this, but sometimes I wish they'd say *anything* else instead. I'm sure they mean well, but it honestly feels backhanded sometimes. Not once has someone ask how I feel, how well they work, if I like them. Nothing like that. Just ""wow they're so small and invisible."" 

[댓글]
No, you aren’t the only one. Not only that but would also get told “Wow you speak well for a deaf person” or “Wow you don’t act like you are deaf.” So infuriating. I AM proud of being Deaf and they need to see I’m not trying to be fixed!!

Uneducated people assume they work just like glasses. They are just marveling at the tech. You could respond (or not) by saying something like you said in your post! Like “Yes they are small - maybe they’d be more helpful if they were larger.”

I feel ya. Hearing people/abled people are the WORST for this. Like god forbid if it was visible? Would the sky fall down if they ever caught a glimpse of someone's hearing aid? Would the world end? (shock, horror!)

I'll never forget the first day I went into work with my shiny new BAHA processor and the first thing my colleague said was ""wow, no one will have to see it"". It didn't even make me angry, just sad about how long it's taking that shitty attitude to die out.

I agree. I always chose the color that stood out the most. I wanted hearing folks to be aware of the deafness

I have people tell me that if they didn’t know I had hearing aids they wouldn’t notice them. It annoys me a bit, for 2 reasons mainly.

First reason is that I am disabled and I make all my mobility aids and stuff flashy, colourful and cute, so being told that annoys me that my hearing aid is unnoticeable, I want it to be pink or blue or just a colour that isn’t silver.

Second reason is that I actually want people around me to know I’m hard of hearing. If people could easily see my hearing aid then they might not cover their mouths when talking or do something helpful along those lines. I know some people are really self conscious about their hearing, and that’s valid, I’m just not that type of person

I'd cry from relief if hearing aids were like 10x bigger, but actually allowed me to communicate in social situations. 

You are not the only the one. It's a terrible trait of the industry too. Focused on gimmicks and hiding them, all for boomers who have fairly mild loss.

The stigma. I am fine being Deaf. I don't need to hide it

ME. I would rather people see them, because then they know I cannot hear well and won't get annoyed at me or think I'm rude for not hearing or understanding them or asking them to repeat something five times. I have the tiny RIC type with domes (which I hate in general). 

I need new ones, and I am requesting earmolds (which will be colored), and ideally actual tubes instead of wires that I feel like I am going to break if I fall asleep or accidentally sit on them. And I want a color that is not any sort of hair or skin tone; ideally blue or green or similar so, again, people can actually see them. 

I can speak fine and don't sound deaf/HoH, am very good at figuring out things based on context and body language, and so people tend to forget I cannot hear them well or at all. Colored earmolds and hearing aids seem like a good reminder, or as good as I can make a reminder unless I tape a sign to myself. Unfortunately most HAs don't come in actual colors, so I'm probably going to make the audiologist find whatever colored ones will work best for me because I'm so tired of being invisible and forgotten. I know the Phonak Sky hearing aids have a ton of colors, though I don't know if they can do the tinnitus program and other stuff I need.  But they are a 12/10 if I rate them for color and visibility!

Those kinds of comments don't really bother me but I understand why you feel the way you do and agree with the general sentiment.  All the jokes that are like, ""my dad dropped his hearing aid in the pool again, old people are so funny hahaha"" really do bother me. I hate the perception of hearing aids as being a humiliating part of aging that younger people get to mock. Not only is it incredibly offensive and disrespectful toward elderly people, where does this attitude leave those of us who have needed hearing aids since we were kids or young adults?

  
Edited: wrote compliments when I meant to write comments! Seems like an important distinction.

I’d just go, “why are you so embarrassed about the idea of visible disability? I don’t want your insulting pity. You either celebrate me as I am, or take your bigotry somewhere else so I don’t have to smell it.”

Definitely valid frustration. I get these comments often as well. Hearing people tend to completely disregard the fact that people in the DHOH community are proud of their deafness and culture and don’t see any reason to hide it. I got bright pink hearing aids after multiple suggestions to match my hair color. Just don’t see any point in hiding something that makes me who I am. I also lost my hearing a bit later in life, 13/14, and feel like going from hearing to deaf with my hearing friends and family gets double the amount of these comments.",2025-05-26 12:13:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kvstoo/frustrated_with_backhanded_compliments/
1kvoaco,deaf,"How does nerve sensitivity work, and can amplified sounds damage less sensitive/other-focused nerves?","Hello,

The way i understand it is, we have a long row of nerves, each one has a kind of curve of sensitivity to different frequencies, and each has a peak sensitivity to a particular frequency, which ill call its focus. 
Is that correct so far?
Well, in cases of sensorineural hearing loss, i understand that some of these nerves are dead, and the surrounding nerves can pick up the frequencies it focused, but at a lower volume (as they are less sensitive to these frequencies)
Is that correct?
Therefore, i ask,
Lets say i had an -90dB HL at 8khz. That means that, for my ear to pick up 8khz sounds, i need 80db amplification, because the hairs that focused on 8khz are dead and the nearest ones are 'quite far away' in terms of focus frequency.
Is that correct?
Now, obviously 90dB of amplification + whatever addtional volume is played on top of that, would cause deafness in a normal hearing person. But how about me? If a sound is played exclusively at 8khz, with a 90dB amplification and addtional volume, would the less sensitive nerves be damaged by this sound?

Thank you very much, and sorry for the abruptness. I just want a straight answer and ive struggled to find one haha.",2025-05-26 07:18:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kvoaco/how_does_nerve_sensitivity_work_and_can_amplified/
1kve9wg,deaf,Tips and starters?,"I recently started dating a guy that I've been head over heals with since I was 14,15. I am now F 26 yrs old w/a 10 year difference. Hes has meant a lot to me for a very long time... I just never saw him with me, I think he's completely out of my league....  and as soon as we started dating I took the interest in learning ASL. He's so amazing I literally would do anything for him, and he brings the best out in me. 

I have noticed he can become extremely frustrated and not understanding when it comes to me signing or not being able to speak his language completely. I've asked for him to help teach me but I think a huge part of it too is he's scared and maybe it's hard for him to accept that I want to do this for him and us so we can have a successful relationship? 
He's had a failed relationship in the passed that I won't go into much detail but he took the time to teach her and it ended ugly and he was then single for 5 yrs. Now he just tells me to use websites...

Don't get me wrong I have learned quite a bit in about 3 months BUT it's A LOT, and can be sooo overwhelming.
He gets frustrated if I ask to slow down or repeat. We got into a huge fight basically over the whole asl thing. I feel bad that I don't know more but I don't know how else to excel my learning faster without having someone use it with me everyday. I use an app Lingvano and I think it's really great. But it really is only teaching me the basics of basics at the moment. 

I don't know if this will come off offensive but I don't see him as deaf. I never have I've always seen him like everyone else and sometimes I do forget his is deaf. We have laughed about it a few times... ironically I am slowly losing my eyesight, so I can only imagine the the things he has to put up with the public's. I know people can be misunderstanding and so cruel... 

Any advice??

3 months is not enough time, it sounds like he’s super impatient and stubborn with unrealistic expectations that you can sign well within 3 months. It’s not you, you’re doing the best you can and it’s hard to practice by yourself and not with another person besides him.

Go to school to learn. Join the ASL club there. Do not use him as a teacher.

Sounds like he’s gun-shy on teaching partners to sign after his last relationship. Can’t blame him there. A partner learning sign just for you can be fraught and feel bad, especially if they rely on you to teach them. 

Honestly if I were you? I would pause the relationship and see if you feel the desire to learn ASL outside of him. Three months is way too early to be having consistent fights, regardless of reason/topic. Giving yourself and him some space with lower pressure, along with you learning some ASL independently, and see what blossoms from there. Best of luck to you both!

r/ASL

I’m sure you mean well, but it would offend me if someone spoke about me this way, saying they don’t see me as deaf.  Deafness is part of me, denying it is like saying you’re colorblind and don’t see someone as black, etc.  What you should be saying is that you whole heartedly accept him, deafness and all, and want communication to be easy for both of you. I don’t mean that to be harsh because I think your heart is in a good place, I just would not say that.
  Deaf people have the burden of educating hearing people their whole lives.  It’s a huge burden to expect him to help you learn a whole second language.  Do online courses and commit to learning ASL with or without him, or don’t do it at all…it’s a huge task and he’s not going to want you to be resentful later.  If you started to feel like, wait, I even learned ASL for him, and resented the time and energy you have put into the relationship (because you spent all this time learning ASL for him) it’s going to be a problem.  I hope that makes sense.

Is there any way you could get a tutor or lessons elsewhere? Are you communicating exclusively in ASL? I can understand him being frustrated if that’s his main source of communication but I think you’ve got to give both yourself and him some grace. 
It sounds like you’ve already tried this but I think you need to have a proper conversation about what exactly is frustrating him. I personally find it irritating when people say they don’t see me as deaf, or that they forgot. It doesn’t offend me, but it does show a lack of general awareness. As you say, he gets frustrated with you asking to slow down or repeat something but that’s something that deaf &amp; HoH people deal with daily. Only to then be told “it doesn’t matter” or “I’ll tell you later”.
It’s amazing that you want to learn and it’s great that you’ve already shown initiative in doing so. Don’t be so hard on yourself.

Check out the Sign Language Center — they offer some online courses. I'm sure there are others, but this is the one I'm familiar with. Keep in mind that it takes years to become fluent, although it really depends on how quickly each person picks it up

Hello, wishing you the very best and I do appreciate that you are reaching out for input. However, I'm picking up on some red flags.

If I'm understanding correctly, he's 10 years older than you. You are in a very small rural community. What is it that makes you want this Deaf man that is 10 years older than you? I see that you are trying to learn ASL which is wonderful and it sounds like you are doing great but consider his perspective. It can be exhausting trying to teach someone ASL when you can be focusing energy elsewhere like developing the relationship. Are there any Deaf events you can go to together? Many places have regular monthly Deaf/ASL meetups at coffee shops. Deaf schools will also do theater productions.

I wouldn't like it if a woman/man learned ASL for me.

1kvddfo,deaf,[Advice Needed] Struggling to wear hearing aids,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get some advice or even just hear from others who might have gone through something similar.

I’m hard of hearing and was given hearing aids in 2023. Honestly, I’ve barely used them since getting them. At my checkups, I find myself lying and saying I’ve been wearing them regularly, but the truth is…I haven’t.

The reason is, I have sensory issues and I’ve never really gotten used to how the hearing aids feel or sound. They’re uncomfortable, sometimes very overwhelming, no matter what setting they’re on and I end up taking them off not long after putting them on. But now I’m at a point where I feel stuck.

People around me seem frustrated when I ask them to repeat things. I get snapped at or made to feel like I’m being difficult on purpose. I understand why—it probably seems like I’m refusing to use the tool that could “fix” the problem. But it’s not that simple. I feel so guilty all the time, like I’m letting everyone down, but wearing the aids is still really hard for me.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? How do you deal with the guilt or pressure from others? Did anyone eventually get used to hearing aids after initially struggling, or find a different solution that helped?

Any advice, stories, or support would mean a lot! 😚

I used to lip read, but I lost sight in one eye due to a detached retina (was unable to be repaired) so it is difficult to read lips anymore.

I like to go for walks and shop, but people talk - and I have this bad habit of replying verbally - at which point they assume that I can carry on a conversation - I explain my situation and they get annoyed and walk away. Do folks wear a button or badge that people can read to know that I can't hear? As soon as I speak, they assume that I can converse, as I speak. Thanks for your time.

Last Edit - Grateful. I appreciate everyone who has taken the time to reply.

1ku0jn4,deaf,How do you feel when you a hearing person communicate with you in sign language,"Imagine a scenario where you go to a cashier and have to communicate through written notes, but then you discover the cashier knows sign language and you’re able to sign back to place your order. How would you feel in that moment?

  
For me, I would say I’d feel excited or surprised because not many hearing people learn sign language, and it’s rare to find someone who does

[댓글]
Happy is how I’d feel.
Not sure why this is a question. I’m pretty sure every culture appreciates when outsiders learn a few phrases.

I’m HoH but I’ll say when someone is informed of this and chooses to look at me when talking, enunciate a bit, not shout, and be open to repeating themselves?  Im overjoyed.

[deleted]

I wouldn't be excited or surprised.

I would be grateful/happy and appreciative.

I’m hearing and a former cashier. I had a Deaf coworker and a few Deaf customers. Some of them, upon realizing I could sign, just continued on with our conversation like it was no big deal at all and they didn’t show much emotion at the fact I could sign. Others would become very happy, want to keep the conversation going, have a huge smile, thank me for learning sign, etc. Both reactions are totally valid. I don’t know Spanish but my coworkers who knew Spanish and could communicate with our customers who only knew Spanish got similar reactions. 

I think what I would say to my fellow hearing people who sign is to not go in to these situations with any expectations of the Deaf/HoH person’s reaction. It’s an incredible feeling to watch someone’s face light up when they realize you can communicate in their language, but there’s also a lot of beauty in there being little to no reaction/emotion and it’s just treated as normal. For some, you may be one of the only people they can have a real conversation with; for others they have plenty of people in their life they can sign with and it’s just another interaction, nothing too significant. 

When I worked retail I wore a pin for awhile to show that I could sign. When I started we only had one regular Deaf customer, but as the months went on we had a handful of regular Deaf customers. Some were born Deaf, some were late-deafened, some had hearing aids, some could speak, etc. I loved connecting with them no matter their background or the details of how/why they were deaf.

Happy but like, annoyed about it bc why can't this just be normal.


Like I don't need them to have a full conservation, just though to say the stock phases for their job, like do you want a bag, do you want a receipt, like lots of it can be done with gestures too, but it's still nice

I’ve had this happen on several occasions.  My favorite barista at Starbucks always signed “good morning” and “thank you” to me and it made my day every time.  I was sad when he no longer worked there.  Opportunities to be seen and understood as a deaf person in a hearing majority world are rare.  I always appreciate when someone is trying to meet me halfway with communication even if they aren’t skilled at it.

Really depends, if they act normal and sign based on what business I am doing, I will appreciate it.

If it is someone trying to learn and sign things that are not related to my business,  I get annoyed.

I'm a photographer at a renaissance faire. In the mornings, before they open, I get different folks who tell me if there's anything special going on and if they need me at a specific time and all that. I was standing in an area, trying to blend in to the crowd while still getting the photos they wanted when one of the cast members who had asked me to be there came out from backstage, locked eyes with me and signed ""thank you"". I almost burst into tears from the surprise.

I like it. I'm HoH and my girlfriend started learning sign right before we got together and she asked me out in sign

I get extremely annoyed because while it’s great they know sign language, it’s very annoying they jump to the assumption every deaf person signs, whereas I cannot learn sign nor do i need it.

What if the hearing person with whom you were interacting said, in sign and vocally, I’m learning to sign but I’m not very good. How would you like to conduct this transaction?

Yes, I know that’s a lot to ask, but that’s how people get better and learn what’s appropriate and what’s not.  They have to learn from experience.

If that happened to me, I’d probably say, “I’m learning too, but you’re probably better at it. I’d rather do basic lip reading/vocal com today.  Thanks for asking.”

And maybe in a year, I’ll say something different to the same question.

Relief, because it’s faster to sign, even if they only know ten signs. They can use the context to figure out ones they don’t know.",2025-05-24 01:57:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ku0jn4/how_do_you_feel_when_you_a_hearing_person/

My best advice is to reach out to your local deaf school and see if the offer parent to infant program.

1ktqk38,deaf,Audist CI Specialist,"Not sure what I’m looking for here but had an awful experience with a CI specialist today and I’m feeling quite down. 

Background: born 100% deaf in right ear, stated progressively losing hearing in my L ear in Oct 2024. Now have severe hearing loss in the left (all 60-75 dB range) I wear hearing aids to support the left, but find speech to still require my full attention to understand.

After my recent audiogram showed my unaided speech recognition to be in the mid 50s, my otologist sent me to a CI specialist. After testing today, it was determined I don’t qualify because I have 78% word recognition with my hearing aids. 

I expressed to her that I struggle to understand still with my hearing aids, and that I can’t wear them hardly at all- I have debilitating migraines most days and the hearing aids make them way worse, and I find all the extra sound quite uncomfortable. These are some of the things she said:

1. Pointed at the interpreter and said “this can’t be your only solution”
2. “You NEED to be able to hear someone if your back is to them, if you’re opening the fridge you need to be able to hear them ask something like to grab the pickles- we are designed to have constant auditory input”
3. “You should be wearing your hearing aids constantly”
4. “You COULD hear [if I wore the aids constantly], you need to preserve your auditory processing. That’s the choice I would make for you, I hope you make that choice for yourself” 
5. “Well you need to fix the migraines, you’re 25, it sounds like they’re controlling your life”- she said without asking if I’ve seen someone about them, I have, and despite multiple MRIs and medication trials they have not improved. The only thing that slightly helps is removing the hearing aids and staying in the dark.
6. Used the term “most hearing impaired individuals”
7. Kept referring to hearing loss as “lacking”.
8. “If you can’t tolerate the hearing aids there’s no way you could tolerate a CI” 

I completely understand that technically hearing loss is the lacking of an ability, but as she reminded me, she’s been doing this for 30 years- I would expect a much more culturally sensitive approach? She made me feel like it was completely my fault the hearing aids don’t help enough and that I’m choosing to lose my ability to hear or ever have a functioning CI in the future (likely to continue to lose remaining hearing) because I find the aids so uncomfortable. 

On top of all of this- I feel embarrassed and like a fraud now for calling myself Deaf because I hear too well with hearing aids to qualify for the CI. I feel so confused because that’s not how it feels in real life, but then there are moments when I can hear clearly and I feel like “maybe I can’t say I’m Deaf”- even though I much prefer to sign and have never been fully hearing.

Clearly I have stuff to work through- but any support or thoughts are helpful. My whole family is hearing and very “fix it” focused, so they can’t fully understand why a Deaf positive provider would be important.

When I read the post title I thought ""Oh it's probably not that bad there's a big difference between being pathology centered in thinking about deafness and being audist. But I saw those comments and YIKES!  Start finding a new doctor. Don't go back to this one. 

You're not a fraud. Deafness is a spectrum, I didn't start referring to myself as deaf until I started meeting deaf people that can hear better than I can.  So you can use hard of hearing or deaf whatever suits you.  Hearing people will falsely assume that deaf means you hear nothing ever, and that hard of hearing mean that louder is better that's not true at all, as you know.  So there's no perfect nomenclature and sometimes people suck.

My audiologist is pretty good, (I got a CI recently got activated in December) but as a required part of qualifying, insurance companies require you to try hearing aids. Oh what F@$\^ing torture that was, Everything was so damn loud (and unintelligible) My audiologist did comment something about being able to handle the CI and I replied with something like ""yeah but a CI won't be rattling my ear drum like this thing""  And I was right, with the CI shit is loud but it doesn't hurt my ear.

I would fire that specialist, provide feedback, and go somewhere else.

What an audist discriminatory bitch, I’m so sorry. Saying that you’re not deaf because you can hear with hearing aids is literally the same as saying you can walk with a walker so you’re not handicapped. If you can perform a task at an average person’s proficiency, but only if you use an assistive device, then you’re not performing at average proficiency. The caveat that you are using an assistive device is what defines the fact it is not standard proficiency in the first place! And a CI and a hearing aid are not even remotely the same assistive device. A CI has no effect on your eardrum and a hearing aid is still utilizing your eardrum and your cochlear nerve. I cannot fathom how someone could be a professional in a field that has a very open and distinct culture and still be so prejudiced. That is just insane to me.

&gt; I feel embarrassed and like a fraud now for calling myself Deaf

You said it yourself — the CI specialist was a total audist.  Are you going to let an audist rewrite your identity for you?

Walk away from that specialist.

😱🤯🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬  Oooh, fuuuuuuuck thaaat lady!!  The f’king audacity, utter non-compassion, blithering ignorance, &amp; more…  I can’t even finish my thoughts, I’m so beyond…livid doesn’t even begin to accurately describe my feelings.  

I would also sincerely warn others against going to them!!

Holy shit. That person definitely got into audiology to “cure deafness.” What an awful human being. 

If you can, I suggest writing reviews on Google and Yelp and everywhere else possible. Don’t be rude, just descriptive, so there’s no grounds to remove it. Other folks need to know.

Too many audiologists, ENT’s aren’t patient-friendly, even discriminatory! Get a new audiologist, ENT. Fuck these people!

Go to someone else.

Find another audiologist.  I went through several on my journey to get a CI.  But I will warn you that if your hearing aids are overwhelming you and contributing to your migraines, the CI will make this even worse. CIs aren’t like HAs that you pop in and amplify all the sounds. Your brain needs to learn to interpret the new electrical stimulation for what’s its “hearing”.  I’ve had mine for 10 years now and while in the booth, I hear excellent. In reality like a store or restaurant, I’m falling back on lip reading to supplement the hearing.  Try to find a new audiologist and get tested again and take the time to talk to them about the experiences their other patients have had.  The sub on here for cochlearimplants can help too.

This sounds like a typical CI specialist unfortunately. Try and find a different specialist who may be a bit more sensitive, however CI specialists are notoriously bad with the deaf community. They usually try to hide it a bit better, but still they won’t usually be your favorite provider.

One point I would be mindful of is the migraines.
Growing up I never got headaches, not even a normal amount. After the CI, the frequency has increased.
Now there aren’t any studies showing that CIs can lead to increased headaches and migraines, many deaf folks in the community have unanimously said that they increase headaches and migraines.
If you ask a surgeon, they will say they do not. But if you ask a deaf person who uses cochlear implants and can remember their life before and after implantation, I would ask them.

This specialist sucks as a person, and since shes so rude and dismissive to her clients she cant be a very good doctor either. But I'm not Deaf so I will leave that conversation to others. 

Replying because the comment about migraines stuck out to me. I get frequent migraines too. If hearing aids are already bothering you, I don't think CIs are going to bother you less. Its even more sound and more stimulation. Your brain has to relearn how to process sound. By all means, get CIs if you want them, but just know thats a possible outcome. I work with a client that has cochlears and gets migraines in super loud environments. 

I find a lot of doctors are super ignorant about migraines. Had a primary care doctor tell me I was faking it and refuse to refer me to a neurologist because I didn't display every single textbook symptom. I switched providers immediately.

The suggestion that you can ""fix"" migraines alone would immediately take me to getting an opinion from someone else.

Oh HELL NO. You need to go somewhere else. Unfortunately she’s been working in the field maybe too long and might be set in antiquated thinking that should not be acceptable today. That said, that is only if you really want the CI. You may be happy with or without it.

Holy smokes, this CI specialist has terrible bedside manner! You are right to feel a certain way about.

I went for a CI evaluation with the clinic at ENT and I really should have looked at their website before I went. [Under adult qualifications, it says this (absolutely not kidding)](https://www.entacochlear.com/candidacy-evaluation/):

“Have a strong desire to be part of the hearing world.”

And the evaluation sounded a lot like yours. 

I’m sos sorry you went through that. Please see someone else.

Ugh I’m so infuriated on your behalf. Love, Deafness is a spectrum. Just because you have speech recognition in a sound proof quiet booth does not equal the same results in an open room with background noise, music, accents, yelling, what have you. That is common sense. 

And hearing “loss” isn’t a hard baseline. You can hear a whistle and startle but struggle with other pitches. It’s about not picking up certain frequencies. When people start to lose their hearing, constenant letter sounds are the first to go. So there’s a lot of missing context when you “hear” and your brain works to fill in those gaps for you. That is why you feel mentally exhausted after using your aids all day. 

All that to say she knows better. Or should.

This sounds exactly like an audiologist I saw when I wanted to get a second implant. Both ears had been candidates and I had minimal speech understanding with a hearing aid but I speak well (my hearing loss didn’t get bad until after I learned to talk and then went all the way bad). She did objective tests of hearing and found that I had none but still told me that a CI wouldn’t help me.
She made an audiology student sit in the booth with me for hearing tests (which started at 90 dB and went up from there. The poor student was jumping). She talked to me when she was adjusting my CI (I only had my hearing aid on and I had no hearing with that) and expected me to understand her. I just signed “I can’t hear you” and she wagged a finger in my face as if ASL is bad. 
I don’t like talking if I can’t hear myself because I’ve been told by kind family members that I’m difficult to understand.

I was born deaf in one ear (100%) and hearing has declined in my right ear to now being a profound loss.  

I do not qualify for a CI. I had severe headaches up until my late 40’s ( I still have the headaches but they don’t rule my life now). 

I found the comment of always using the hearing aids interesting because as I lost the hearing, I was surprised to find I liked the silence (tendinitis is always there). Due to light sensitivity , I like the dark. 

I make decisions about how to deal with all the issues I deal with and I don’t feel bad when I go against my Doctor’s opinion. When I disagree with a Doctor ( has to be serious) I fire them.

I have dealt with health issues for more than 60 years, I have read, talked and watch programs related to those issues. No i am not a doctor but i am an expert on me.  

Just walk away from those who don’t support you!!!

Hearing aids do make the tinnitus worse most of the time, but always there. Be kind to yourself!

It took years but I now see the lack of hearing as a blessing.  Hope you find peace.

It’s so disappointing &amp; frustrating to read how un deaf friendly some Audiologists, ENTs etc are. They’re the very people who are meant to be helping. Sorry I don’t have much helpful to add or say other than if possible find a new one. Also try not to let them affect the way you identify and view yourself. Easier said than done I know.

Otolaryngologists are trained to specialize in “resolving” any “abnormalities” - this perspective is trained into them. I’m so sorry they didn’t treat you with the respect and kindness you and your culture deserved. This clinical based model is absent of regard for anything other than the physical loss of sound and how to “fix” that. You should consider yourself blessed that you aren’t confined to the boring box of “Hearing impaired” they are trying to put you in. I feel pity for all the people in the world that miss out on Deaf culture and ASL. My life would be so dull without them.

As Deaf AF, my mom told me to go to audiology. I said why? She said she didn't know, but it's required. I went there after high school with mom. I thought I went to audiology, but I sat in a tall seat like testing eyes. No ASL interpreter there. A CI Specialist came in with a few. He checked in my ear each. He asked me via mom interpret, "" Do you want to get a CI?"" I shook my head no. He gave me and mom a ugly attitude when he moved his head down like ""damn, I don't get money"" or "" that girl doesn't understand"". He gave me such a traumatic experience, which means he's audism. I was so crying at home after that when I was 14 years old.  Now I'm 36 years old and still fine with Deaf identity due to Deaf culture, embracing Sign language as linguistic, and accessibility provided by organizations.

I wanted to make clever as clear crystal that my parents learned that I am Deaf at audiology when I was two years old. An audiology did suggest about CI. They had no clue what it is. The audiology explained about CI surgery and device placed in the head that made them uncomfortable because surgery is so much for a little girl. They rejected the suggestion and wanted to let me make decision when I got older. Sent me to the Deaf program at school. 

FK your CI Specialist and give her a review. Find another one.",2025-05-23 18:16:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ktqk38/audist_ci_specialist/
1ktmxcd,deaf,A Beautiful Story,"A beautiful story

I found this comment on a Facebook Reel and it's so beautiful I feel more people need to hear it:

My great aunt was deaf/ blind/mute.. She was born (~1920s) at a time when parents didn't take such a child home but my great grandparents did, she was 1st born.  She lived to 74 years. She went to the Helen Keller School in ATL and would send letters to family via the newspaper (I have found several of these letters as she had a unique name). Different time indeed.
My aunt would place her hands on mine while I signed so she could feel her way through the sign. We did far more than finger spelling with her and she was quick to read and respond
She had no children but helped raise over 100 children across several generations throughout her long life. She helped put together a few genealogy books with her sister (my grandmother) as family was important to her. 
She was always present in my life until her passing. She has been missed for 28 long years and I think of her often.

1ktcjug,deaf,Rejected from MedTech Program Because I’m Deaf,"Hi everyone, I’m a deaf college student from the Philippines, and I just received a message from a school I applied to. I wanted to study BS Medical Technology, it's something I was really interested in, but they told me I may not be admitted because of my hearing condition.

They said their facilities and teaching methods are only for students with ""normal hearing"" and that they don’t have any provisions for deaf students. They also told me that if I want to appeal, I have to get a medical clearance from an ENT saying I’m ""fit to study"" in a medical institution.

It just hurts. I already know being deaf doesn't make me less capable...I can read, study, understand science, I just need accessible ways to learn, like visual or typed instructions, or written materials. But instead, they basically told me I’m not welcome unless a doctor says it’s okay. I feel frustrated. Why do schools still think like this? Why are we still being treated as less than? I just want to pursue a career like anyone else.

If anyone has experienced something like this, I’d really appreciate hearing how you felt or what helped you through it. Thanks for letting me vent🤍

[댓글]
I am a certified ASL Interpreter currently living in the Philippines. I am happy to offer any support I can. Please feel free to message me. &lt;3

Where is your course based? Here in the UK I’m pretty certain that would not be allowed to happen. You need to make more enquiries and definitely appeal. This is appalling, it’s discriminatory and it’s not the 1950’s!!

I don't know much about the Philippines but if possible, speak to any office that tackles discrimination and file an appeal.

Also what's the usual approach for deaf people who want to go to study? Do they get support?

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Do you know any Deaf professionals in the medical school you could reach out to for advice? They may have experienced something similar. 
It might be that the school doesn't know how to accomodate you and is trying to scare you off so they don't have to learn. 
You may have to get really pushy. When my deaf daughter was in school, they were refusing to caption the videos in the course. They'd tell her that she should just skip over, it wasn't that important anyway. She was like ""no, it's part of the course. Why would it be in the course if it's not important?""  What really pissed me off was they were all about having her advocate for herself but then they never listened to her. I got fed up and had my 13 kid caption a random science video. I sent it to the school and said my 13 year old can caption a video and make it accessible. I'm sure that there are multiple people in your office with Masters degrees. If a 13 yr old in grade 8 can do it, then I""m sure you guys can go figure it out. I also made it clear that this was a one time favour my son did my daughter. It's not his job to caption videos. It's the school job to caption the videos and provide the materials. 
The school did do it after that. But sometimes you just have to push through and get it done yourself and then turn around and be like ""see! Was that so hard? That's how you do it. It's you're job now. 
My daughter has been told that she can't attend workshops and they'll be no accommodations for her by people in admin. But she just goes anyway and then goes directly up the speaker and asks them to wear the FM (they always do) and it bypasses the grumpy office people.
There is a book called Silent Alarm you might want to check out. https://www.amazon.ca/Silent-Alarm-Edge-Deaf-EMT/dp/1563680440

There are Deaf doctors. This is unnecessary discrimination.

""Due to the condition of your ears"" is so gross

ASL Interpreter here from Texas. It's unfortunate the hurdles you are having to go through. There are a couple of DEAF MEDICAL DOCTORS who work in Austin, Texas. I personally know of a variety Deaf medical and mental health professionals.  

[Healthcare Majors: Dr. Chris Moreland, physician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tpjR0qgft8)

Deaf people can and make great medical professionals.

They want you to secure a “medical clearance” after they denied you? So now you have to go and spend time/money on getting that, just to appeal it. No guarantee it will be approved then either. And it feels like a slap in the face, like they need confirmation from a medical professional. 

In some places, this is discrimination that could lead to a hefty lawsuit. Depending on where the school is, call a lawyer in this field.

Hey, I don’t know much about laws in the Philippines, but I do know one thing. Don’t let them get away with this. This is blatant discrimination and they should definitely learn a difficult lesson about how to be inclusive as an institution instead of just denying anyone they deem costly/difficult to accommodate. 

I know this is difficult, but someone has to be the trailblazer and just be persistent. Even if that means getting lawyers involved. Nothing will change for any Deaf student that might apply in the future if nothing is done now. This is unfortunately how we got rights to equal access in education in the US. Someone had to challenge the status quo and not give up. This opens up opportunity for those that will come behind you. 

Do not give up, Become that trailblazer that shows the way.

Yep, discrimination everywhere and you can sue.

You should 100% appeal and be an example for them for future students. That is just insane. 😡 Im sorry.

If this is for biomedical tech, I can promise you there are Deaf biomedical techs

Awe I'm sorry. I don't know much about the Philippines but I know here in the States they hire people to specifically help deaf people study in the medical field. It's odd to hear that they don't do the same in the Philippines. I recommend to continue to appeal it or find another school because they're clearly not worth your time. Don't give up your dreams ❤️

Might be an ADA violation (if in the US). There are lawyers who specialize in that area of law.

I am deaf too. But 3% hearing. I wear the strongest OTE hearing aids made. They do help a bit.

[deleted]

I have been rejected from a lot of private sector IT jobs because of my disability (hearing impared). yes its really hard but dont be discouraged.you are not alone.

I smell a lawsuit....

You got a rejection via a text?

This is shocking and not fair! Sorry this happened to you.

Look up the Eko Core 5000 stethoscope- it’s great for Deaf providers.

I'm deaf but I use Live Transcribe everywhere, I don't even need captioners anymore. It supports 70+ languages. 


Anyway, what school is it? Where is it located?

This is why we have ADA. Appeal to your govt to make your own. Otherwise, you lack a legal leg to stand upon. 

Or: immigrate and study here, using ADA to your own advantage while you live right now, today. Laws take years to make. So you either pioneer a break in that barrier, or study abroad.

If in the US, a program doesn't get to decide if you enroll due to disability status. Contact the disability services office and they should be able to help.

“hearing impaired”

Get a lawyer

I'm sorry you're experiencing this. You are not alone.

Something to consider is to go to an ENT. You may be able to find someone who will state that you are fit to study in a medical institution. Though I have a feeling that even with this document, they will establish other barriers.

Also consider applying to other institutions, and do not disclose you are deaf until after you step into a classroom.

Remember that there are many deaf medical professionals out there. Many can be found at [AMPHL.org](http://AMPHL.org)

I am afraid I do not know the laws and ways of things in the Philippines to be able to comment here. Here in the UK, there are laws that prevent the response you have got. Deaf students can now study medicine with accommodations. However this itself is still relatively new, so may not have reached your country yet?

What they are doing is illegal

What country are you in?

1kt8hqm,deaf,having a hard time with hearing sibling,"note: sorry if there’s any confusing language, i’m trying to speak kindly and delicately. 

born hearing, slowly losing my hearing since i was about 8, im 19 now. my sibling has never been particularly horrible with anything, but recently, as my hearing is taking a turn and becoming a problem, im meant to be fitted for hearing aids this summer. my sister has started whispering intentionally and mocking sign language, on top of other things. ive explained that not only it it personally hurtful, it’s ableist, but she’s kept it up. she’ll whisper and then ask ‘could you hear that’ and sometimes even have the gaul to act confused when im upset. im not looking forward to receiving additional bullying from my sibling when i do get hearing aids, if her current behaviour is any indicator does anyone have any advice? i love her dearly but she’s causing me a lot of issues, especially when it comes to feeling comfortable with my disability, something i had just gotten close to being. 

[댓글]
Do you mind sharing their age? If they’re pretty young they may not realize the extent of how unkind they are being and might just need a different explanation to really understand. If they’re a tween/teen or adult, I’d say they’re absolutely old enough to understand how unkind they are being and should definitely have gotten the message by now. 

Regardless of their age, if you’ve been communicating about the issue then you’re doing the right thing. And it now may be time for some boundaries like “if you continue to mock sign language or exclude me by whispering, I am going to leave because I won’t tolerate disrespect.” 

I’m sorry you’re dealing with this and I wish I had more advice, but keep sticking up for yourself. Sending you love and hoping your sibling comes around and is more accepting and kind to you.

In a few years you'll move away and you'll never talk to them again.  I have a brother like that. His children barely know I exist.  The communication cut off wasn't immediate it dwindled to nothing over maybe 10 years. You can make it go faster if you want.   Some of the other comments are more hopeful, and I wish you the best. Hopefully your sibling will grow up at some point. Don't count on it.

Your sister is,intentionally hurting you. Next time, deprive her of attention. Ignore or walk away. Make it very clear you have zero tolerance for this.

Ooof. I'm 55 now and my brother is about 18 months older than I am. I didn't intentionally go ""no contact"". He cut himself off from our family for over 10 years on his own. When our parents died, he came around a little after each of their funerals. 

When I was around ten or so, he found out that I was learning to read lips (I was born deaf in one ear and hard of hearing in the other). When he found out, he started speaking to me between clenched teeth, so his mouth would barely move. He did other little ableist things as well. I got married and obviously, moved out. 

Once, in our 20s, we were at the holiday gathering at our parents house and the woman he was dating (and eventually married) brought up the mumbly way he speaks and said that other people have commented on it. My mom said something about how he'd been doing that since childhood. That's when I realized when he started doing it. And it isn't the only thing about him. He's also just not a good person (racist, bigoted, homophobic and so on). The last time we spoke was a few months after our dad died and he called me to shout about how he didn't trust me and whatever. (I was executor of our dad's estate because our mom had died a couple years before- anyway, he didn't like it). 

Anyway, the last time we spoke was 2014. The last time he contacted me was some time in 2015 to brag to me (via text) about how he bought a fancy new house. Haven't been in contact with him since.

I’m sorry you’re going through this. It’s a very strange behaviour from your sibling because usually people want to speak to be understood. 

Given that you’ve explained it’s hurtful, I would suggest coming up with some phrases that you can use in these situations. E.g.

“No, I only hear things worth hearing” (this one may escalate things a little).

“No” if they want to be heard, let them repeat themself

(Whispering) “could I hear that?” (Makes them sit with the discomfort of what they’ve done)

“Do you mean to sound rude?” (Calls them out and makes them sit with the discomfort)

“No, can you write it down for me” (makes them put more effort in to get their point across)

“No, I’m having a hard time hearing today so I’m going to sit and read in my room”

Communication is a two way street. It’s their responsibility to communicate in a way that works for you if they want to communicate. If they don’t, leave them be and do something else. Giving them no reaction will likely mean they get bored and do something else with their time.

I hope this helps and I hope your sibling comes to terms with things and gives you the support you deserve!

My doctor is willing to provide an accommodation note and my employer will buy it, but I need to pick the headset.

1kt51ia,deaf,help my doctors are stumped,"little background context-- I'm a teenager and I suffered an extreme TBI (Traumatic brain injury) back in November and was diagnosed with a concussion. since then, i've had two more head injuries (i play a lot of sports, sue me). after that initial TBI, i started to lose my hearing rather quickly. within the span of two weeks, my hearing went from just below normal to moderate/severe hearing loss. Even weirder thing was that it was flat hearing loss (on first audiogram). anyways, it kept progressing. my dad got me hearing aids, (BTE), which helped a lot, but its only progressed. I've had tinnitus since I was a young kid, and it also got worse. The audiologist did a whole battery of testing, which included normal tympanometry, and a just below normal ABR (right ear was slightly slower, and happened to be the worse ear). My cochlea was also fine. My biggest struggle is not only with the hearing loss, but the sudden inability to understand speech as well, *especially* in a crowded place. As a polygot, this is really bad for me. I am constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves, and to do so slower -- and it's humiliating. i'm also very musical and its ruining the piano for me. doctors (and i) originally thought APD (CAPD), auditory processing disorder, because of the inability to understand speech and differentiate sounds, but when we tried to get in on studies they wouldn't accept me because of the additional hearing loss. Then I heard about FND, and I'm in the midst of doing my own research because my doc gave up on me. both my parents are docs and they're trying their best as well. please help I don't know what to do. I learned ASL as a precaution,  and so did my fam, and its really helpful in crowds/restaraunts, but i can't live like this. at least not without answers/a fix. if anyone also has hearing loss related FND please please let me know. i'm desperate. 

[댓글]
Maybe ANSD? If it's not FND and is actually hearing loss-- which the medical definition of tends to err towards permanent--- there's not really a ""fix"" whether or not you get answers. 

You should also probably be checked for CSF leaks just to be on the safe side since it's from an injury , you have tinnitus, and you perceive your hearing loss as progressing.

I would also recommend counseling with a Deaf therapist since you know ASL and seem like you're having adjustment issues. People who are Deaf do both of those things so you might need some help walking through the feelings you're having because being Deaf doesn't have to be the thing that stops you, but negative feelings certainly can very easily.

I know someone who lost most of their hearing due to TBI as well. They still play music from memory, but learning new pieces is challenging. 

I was also an aspiring musician and it has been hard for me too. It takes awhile to get used to your new normal range of hearing. Music you are familiar with sounds different than what it is supposed to sound like... 

I'm hearing music differently now, so I'm able to appreciate different songs than i used to. Give yourself time to get used to it.

My dad lost his hearing as a teenager through a sporting injury, he now has a cochlear implant and I can communicate with him without sign. Learning sign language is amazing but learning to read lips and body language will be more beneficial in my opinion as you have already learnt speech. My sisters and my mum were born deaf and they can’t get the cochlear implant, however I took my sister to dance and taught her through vibration with the music. I know losing hearing is different to being born without hearing, but there are other ways to feel music. I don’t know if this answers anything technically or medically but I just wanted to share my experience and to let you know all is not lost if you have a passion.

Desperate,for what? And,what is stumping your doctors?

I’m not entirely sure but maybe try getting a CT scan of the inner ear/brain? I dont know what it could show but it might show something, esp w tinnitus. ❤️",2025-05-22 23:22:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kt51ia/help_my_doctors_are_stumped/

They never responded to or acknowledged what I typed. We tried several times with the same thing happening. Clearly I’m missing something!

1ksw34q,deaf,Which sign language??,"My 11 month old was recently diagnosed with severe hearing loss. We are a bilingual household (German &amp; English) living in the US, and have plans to move to Australia.

 The moment we found out about their hearing loss, we started learning ASL and feel a lot of guilt for not knowing sooner and starting communicating earlier with our baby. We are still processing what this means but feel really hopeful and excited to learn ASL.

We don't know what is best for our baby. Do we stay in the US because we have learned that deaf culture in certain areas is really prominent? Do we still move to Australia (wanting to move for political reasons and to reunite with family) where there is a much smaller deaf community? 

If we move to Australia, will it confuse our baby to start with ASL and switch to Auslan? (The earliest we can move is in 7 months) And where does German come into play with all of this? The majority of our relatives are German speaking so it was always really important to us to speak only German at home. 

Can you sign in multiple languages? Will that be too much for them? Do we continue to sign in ASL and then speak German when/if they get hearing aids or CI?

I'd love any perspective and insights. We want to live where our baby has the best chances to grow up in a society that supports and embraces their deafness. We also want to live somewhere where programs for children with disabilities / health care, etc is a given. 

[댓글]
If you're definitely moving to Australia, just start with Auslan now. Your baby is only 11 months old, it's not as if they're going to be socialising in the deaf community now so you're only going to be using it amongst your family. It'll be easier for you as learners to just focus on making your one signed language to be stronger instead of having to start over again with a new one in 7 months. 

As a deaf kid whose parents both spoke a foreign language but were advised not to use it at home because I was deaf, please continue your plans to use German at home! I could have been raised trilingual but was only monolingual and I resent my parents and the medical community for it.

Hi! I am a CODA (child of Deaf adult) and a speech-language pathologist. Congratulations on your deaf baby! It may feel overwhelming now, but your family has just been opened up to a whole new, wonderful world. 

Signed languages work just like spoken languages. Your child will be able to learn multiple signed (and oral) languages. The idea that children get ""mixed up"" if exposed to more than one language is a myth. Sometimes they may switch between the two, but it's not because they are confused. It's a normal part of being bilingual. 

It is good that you and your husband are starting with a signed language immediately. Though adults may not realize it, babies are learning language from birth. If you decide to move to Australia, your child will still be able to learn Auslan, just like a child moving from Germany to the US would be perfectly capable of learning English even though they were first exposed to German. 

Your child will also be able to learn oral languages perfectly well. They will actually be more likely to do so if you expose them to a signed language than if you don't. Unfortunately it is likely that you may come across many pediatricians, audiologists, ENTs and even SLPs (WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER) who may discourage you from using a signed language with your child if they use a device like a hearing aid or cochlear implant. You may be told that your child won't be able to learn an oral language or have stunted development if you sign. This is not rooted in science, it is rooted in eugenics (research Alexander Graham Bell and his repression of ASL in the US) and many professionals are still parroting off this nonsense without knowing its origin. 

If you expose your child to a signed language early, it is more likely that they will master oral languages like German and English. When children learn their first language, they are also learning about language. That becomes like a scaffold for language learning for the rest of their life. If a deaf child doesn't have full access to a language because they can't hear it, then they can't build their language scaffold well. We call this language deprivation. 

If a deaf child does have full access to a language because they can see it, then they can better build their language learning scaffold, making even oral languages much easier.

What I tell my parents in my practice is that when you have a deaf child, the biggest difficulty they will have in life is in communicating with others around them. Giving them as many tools in their communication toolbox as make sense is the best thing you can do to prepare them to navigate a hearing dominated world, that can be hearing devices, signed languages, spoken languages, whatever your child may need. So it's a good thing you want all this for your child, and it is 100% possible!

I don't have experience but ASL is a language. So treat it like one. I'm pretty sure babies and kids absorb languages super well so if you use multiple as the baby grows and absorbs language then the kid will grow up multilingual quite easily. But you have to start now. Start with a few basic signs, wait until they get it, then introduce the same ones in the other sign language. Take this with a grain of salt. I have no experience with babies, parenting, or any of the such about language development so it's up to you. But id look into language development in babies and apply what you find to sign language. ITs a language the same as others. so the learning and development will be the same. the other thing is sign language usually gets picked up easier than oral language due to the order of development in babies. So introducing it now instead of later will really be helpful. I'd do ASL and AUSLANG, and then if you find the need for whatever language corresponds with German do that too. But that won't help if your family doesn't learn it so your digression is advised there.

You can certainly learn more than one language- many kids know multiple languages if they're common at home. Speaking German and English is fine as oral language is completely different grammatically than any signed language (asl is much closer to French grammatically than English). Your kids brain is in the sponge stage, just absorbing everything. I think, not positive, if you introduce all this asap and before language solidifies at 4, you'll be fine and your child will know multiple languages. Don't over simplify language to make it ""easier""- that hinders communication. (Sounds like that could possibly be 4, oral English and German, and sign asl and auslan and/or Germany's sign language) 

Your kid will not have an issue knowing more than one sign language if you upkeep/use them all. 

If you stay in the states definitely look into areas like DC, MD, NJ, NY, DE. I would avoid red states right now as the government (especially in red states) is trying to dismantle so many rights(ADA and 504s included). I don't know much about the west coast but I'd assume CA has some good pockets of a deaf community. 

I have no idea what to tell you as far as what's right for your family. I'd assume that moving to Australia (or Germany) would currently be safer but I know next to nothing about Australia. You could reach out to the deaf creators who live in Australia or at least follow them to get an idea of what is covered by law for education and accommodations.

i don’t have an answer for you but i wanted to share that i personally know several deaf adults who are fluent in ASL, AUSLAN, and even other languages (written and/or signed).  your child is about to become an incredible human!

&gt; living in the US


ASL - cause your child needs a Deaf community where they live.


&gt; and have plans to move to Australia.


How definitely and how far in the future?


If definitely and soon - Auslan for the same reason as above.


If maybe and far in the future - ASL because it may never even happen.


&gt; And where does German come into play with all of this? 


It doesn't unless you are gonna live in Germany for any long time or have a connection with the German Deaf community.


Teaching German to your child is a different question that will be based on your child's ability as they grow.

Yes, you can sign in multiple languages. The more, the better! I don't see anything wrong with learning German Sign Language, ASL or Auslan. Since most of your relatives are German, may I suggest that you learn German Sign Language if you speak German at home? And then German and German Sign Language can used together. I know, it's a bit much to ask, but. The more languages anyone knows, the better off.

The kids that I know who learned multiple languages were a little bit delayed or would mix them up for a while. Usually by grade 4 they would get over that and have above average language skills. Absolutely expose and teach your kid several languages but be patient if it takes a bit longer or if they go through stages of preferring one language to another.

I’m an Australian CODA and the only hearing person in my family. I have deaf parents, sisters, aunties and uncles. I currently have lived in Canada for 12 years where they sign ASL, and I’ve always felt involved in deaf culture however I haven’t been able to immerse myself in the culture here due to not knowing ASL and it irritates me because when I come across deaf people I feel connected to them but can’t communicate with them properly. Auslan is a derivative of BSL, I would suggest teaching them Auslan as opposed to ASL if you’re moving to Aus. 

However teaching them to finger spell ASL is beneficial, I’ve backpacked the world and it’s been super handy. 

Australia has a great deaf culture which I haven’t experienced in Canada yet, if you have any more questions let me know :)

I have the unique experience both living in Oz &amp; the States and going from ASL to Auslan with a Deaf child as well as teaching them multiple spoken languages (English &amp; Maori). 

It’s  important to consider what areas in the US and Australia you’re living in and where you plan to move to. For instance Brisbane is the largest Deaf hub in Oz but Sydney or Melbourne also have large Deaf communities but it can be hard to find ALMs, Deaf mentors, Audiologist and other early childhood supports the further out from the major cities you go.

Both CIs (including surgery) and HAs are free for children in Australia through Hearing Australia for citizens and permanent residence that qualify. Additionally I assume your child would qualify for NDIS but you’ll need to apply for that. I can recommend resources regarding that if you’d like. 

Be assured whatever sign language you’re teaching your child it’s forming those neurological language pathways. I will say it’s a bit annoying going from ASL to Auslan in some ways. For example the ASL sign for “what” means “where” in Auslan, and the ASL sign for “where” means “what” in Auslan. Little things like that. My daughters first language is ASL (because I knew ASL prior to having her even though we lived in Australia) I found it difficult as a sleep deprived parent learning a new one but now I’m so grateful to know both. We started learning Auslan together when she was 18 months old and now I’m on my way to being a qualified Auslan interpreter and she now goes to a bilingual Auslan / English preschool. 

Don’t stress now about spoken bilingualism until she gets CIs / HAs. What I would do is have one parent speak exclusively in that language (German) with your child. They’ll pick it up in time just never try and put pressure on yourself or them. 

Happy to help with any questions you have and wish you so much luck in your journey.

If you’re in Australia, teach Auslan with ASL. If you go to Germany, get your German relatives to learn German sign and teach your kid German sign with ASL. 
Slowly, as you develop the secondary sign language during each stay, start to focus on sign locality and drop ASL unless you need it to explain a definition more readily. 

If you plan on being a family of polyglots, double the number of spoken languages you plan on using. That’s what you’re in for.

Here’s an instagram of a mom raising a deaf child in Australia (they use Auslan) but she is an advocate for all signed and spoken languages. You can definitely message her as she has private clients and may help with some guidance! Link here: https://www.instagram.com/raisingbilinguals_?igsh=MTdjemIwaGZzNnk0Nw==

I’m a mom to a HoH 2 year old, diagnosed around 12 months so similar situation. We are now a trilingual household with Spanish, English and ASL. These kids can do it all  and signed language is 100% the best gift you can give to them. She has caught up on all of her developmental milestones with her signs and is now chatting away as well because of the support with sign language.

I’d look to the future and long-term. I don’t think your baby will be confused, not with supportive parents like you and (hopefully) good resources. 

We can be bi-, tri-, or more multilingual. I use ASL, and in addition to English, I speak German and Russian (but I do not sign in either). I even lived in Russia for a couple of years while working on my PhD. 

Was it a challenge? Hell yes! But having family support and encouragement (and it seems like you’re like my parents 😊), plus strong resources as I grew up, made me rather confident.

Ur baby can learn more than just 1 sign language they can catch up easily

DGS (German sign language) and Auslan are both good options, you can absolutely learn more than one sign language. Personally I’d go with DGS and whichever country’s sign language that you’re in. It might be good to pick a parent for each language to be the dominant sign language they use with your child, as it can take 5-7 years per language to gain fluency as an adult.

Kids do understand how to keep multiple languages apart, but you need to give them some clues, like usuallg one language per parent. 


In terms of where to live, sure Australia doesn't have like whole university's with Deaf community, but there are still plenty of Deaf around. 


I think your first step is can you move to Australia with a disabled kid? 


If so contrary to what most of the others say I think switch to Auslan now, not bc it will hard for kid to learn both, I think it will be hard for *you* to learn both, but there are some great online Auslan teachers so you can be a lot more prepared when you get there if you start now.

If you're definitely going to Australia learn Auslan.

Any sign language is better than none, as long as you start immediately. But I'd choose ASL.

You can do both Kylee (you can you tube her) is half Mexican and she is fluent inASL and learning Mexican Sign",2025-05-22 17:08:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ksw34q/which_sign_language/

1ksrfp9,deaf,TTRPG for teaching ASL/BSL - legitimate?,"Found out about an anthology of TTRPGs from Hatchling Games. They say they worked with the Deaf community to create the games, but I can't find any further information on the legitimacy of that claim.

The only links I have are to their shop to buy the games and I don't represent them so I'll just name the games themselves:

- Inspirisles
- Overisles
- Shapes of adventure
- Underisles

My questions are if they actually did work with the Deaf community, if the ASL teaching in particular is actually decent (they claim up to casual conversation level but everything I've seen only looks like the alphabet and some elemental words, no grammar), and if the game itself is actually any fun lol.

But the first point (how involved the Deaf community actually was) is more important. I don't want to buy a game that was another hearing person thing

[댓글]
So...


I bought Inspirisles a while back to check it out. Maybe I should make a review and post it on youtube...


In short - it seemed accurate but unimpressive.


As far as I can tell, they worked with Deaf consultants and the sign language inlcuded is accurate. They also include a brief Deaf awareness and Deaf culture section which is accurate also - but very brief. I am fluent in BSL so I checked that langauge more thoroughly than the ASL sections.


But overall I am unimpressed. Like you say, its the alphabet plus some basic signs. The language us used for the magic system, you make signs in order to do magic effects. As far as I could tell, at least, doing so only occurs one sign at a time with no real utilisation of grammar.


The storyline and worldbuilding is likewise unimpressive. The whole thing is a teenage iseki fiction (protags get pulled into another world) and as far as I could tell the only way that sign language even tied into the story was that it was taught in a wizard school and was used by dragons? Also all protags are secretly distantly related to the Pendragons which is why they get iseki'd and can use sign language magic. The worldbuilding is also straight up mostly ripped from Celtic / British folklore - set in a new arrangement.


I think this was a huge missed opportunity to include more Deaf characters in the story and worldbuilding. 


I don't know if more signs, grammar and different worldbuilding is added in later expansions. I'm EXTREMELY dubious that it can take you up to conversational level - but perhaps the expansions can.🤷‍♀️


I think it would be fun to run for kids. You'd probably want to supliment it by looking up signs with them as you go in a separate dictionary... although this feels like it makes misses the point? I feel like a dictionary of, say, ~100 or so signs. Nothing like that is included.


Oh and also one last pet peeve - the book you get (I have as a PDF) has both the ASL and BSL signs (on separate pages). Which is... fine... but I think separate editions (a BSL edution and an ASL edition) would be extremely easy to make and avoid confusion for learners.",2025-05-22 14:00:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ksrfp9/ttrpg_for_teaching_aslbsl_legitimate/
1ksoxaw,deaf,Would I be rude if...,"Hi there, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but I'm more or less at a loss... I encountered a situation where I was unsure of the etiquette: I am a hearing person, and met with a person who was hard of hearing or deaf-- they had a sign interpreter. I was a student at a university, and wasn't sure with whom to make eye contact with for the duration of my meeting.

I've resolved to simply ask the people I'm in the meeting with next time with whom I should make eye contact with, but wanted to know, would that be considered rude? I don't want to offend anybody, but really didn't understand the etiquette of what was happening, and also had an objective for the meeting as a student (trying to get my own disabilities sorted out with the university: hypoglycemia) so the whole thing was anxiety-ridden for me, but as soon as I left I wondered if I was being a jerk/ignorant, and what I should do to correct it.

Thanks in advance for any insight(s) you might provide, and I'm sincerely sorry if I used incorrect verbiage. I am an old, and am doing my best to address the issue at hand and if you would like to educate me on preferred word choices I'll do my best to change immediately.

The Deaf person who is signing is the one that is having the conversation with you. The interpteter is a tool (although still a human being).


Face the person having the conversation. The one whose ideas you are engaging with. Notice their bodylanguage and emotions - look at things they gesture at while they sign. Engage with them.


You will notice that Deaf people watch both the interpreter and you when you talk. They need to see the interpreter of course, but they will acknowledge your emotions and ideas come from you, not the interpreter.


But there are times when you talk with the interpreter if the interpreter is the one talking to you. For instance they might ask you to repeat something for their sake, at which point you could clarify with them. Or perhaps the interpter might want to inform you of where you should sit and some other best practice stuff. Treat them like human beings doing a job.


AVOID: Looking at the interpreter and saying ""Tell them XYZ"". Sometimes that is fine, when you want to pass on a message for later. But if you are in the conversation with a Deaf person - talk *to* the Deaf eprson.

So in short - look at the person who you are having a conversation with. Most of the time that will be the Deaf person.

The deaf/hoh person is who you make eye contact with!!

Keep eye contact with the person you're talking to, in this case the Deaf/HOH person!

Look at the person you want to speak to, then wait for the interpreter to covey what's been said. You should not refer to the interpreter at all unless that is the person you intend to have a conversation with. Think of the interpreter as a computer speaker connected to the deaf person you are speaking to. 

The deaf person needs to make eye contact with you to know you intend on speaking to them. Also, if they lip-read, they may be able to make out some of what you say. The interpreter may just clarify that information.

As others have said, your conversation is with the Deaf person so your interactions are with them. It's also nice to acknowledge the interpreter, greet them at the start and thank them and say goodbye at the end.",2025-05-22 12:02:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ksoxaw/would_i_be_rude_if/

1ks2wp7,deaf,Wanting a different name sign,"Hi, I’m not sure where to post this, forgive me if this is not the right space. 

I’m a caregiver and one of my clients was an older deaf person who used SEE to communicate. We got close, she gifted me with a name sign before she moved. It’s important to note I am queer. It’s the sign rainbow with a “E”. She said it’s because 1) I’m queer and she loves that about me 2) my personality is colorful. 

Is it wrong I want a different name sign? I feel like I out myself every time I use it. I love it and would use it in close relationships but when I go to meet 10 new people I don’t feel comfortable outing myself. 

Then there is the question of, do people think of queer when they see a rainbow name sign? Is it obvious in the deaf community? 

I feel ungrateful for being cautious when I use it. 

She gave me another one, it’s the sign transgender with a “e” but that one is very obvious, I don’t use it. I am grateful our relationship got close and she gave me one that she loved and, should I wait to get a new one/can I ask a different deaf friend to give me a different one? 

(I am also hard of hearing - as of 2 weeks ago- but that’s new and don’t feel comfortable giving myself a name sign) 

[댓글]
Just don’t use your sign name. If Deaf people need to talk about you, you’ll get a new one.

Don’t share it and just wait for another one to come up. I have a family sign name which is fine but I never liked it that much so I don’t share it. I just tell people to fingerspell.

I'm not Deaf but as a queer signer, I wanna say NEVER feel like you have to out yourself over a sign name. You never have to provide information (sexuality, gender, or sign name) that you're not comfortable with.

Edit to add: I love your sign name, though! Its great that the person who gave it to you was a close friend who fully accepted you!

coming from a deaf person and a queer person, I don’t think I would automatically assume you were based off of your name. that being said, you can definitely resort to finger spelling your name instead as the other people in the chat have mentioned. I think it’s a beautiful and sentimental thing, but if it makes you uncomfortable with people that you are not comfortable with, then that is no problem. I had insecurities about my sign name at the start, but the most important thing to me was that somebody gave it to me that is beautiful. like everyone else said stick with what makes you comfortable! And definitely never feel like you have to out yourself.

Just don’t introduce yourself with that sign name! It’s perfectly fine keeping that private out with a few close friends, if you’re involved in the Deaf community, chances are you’ll get another one. 

I have 3 different sign names, one for work, one for the Deaf community, and one for the Deaf/queer community. I only use the relevant sign name in each community, but sometimes I’ll clarify that I have more than one if people get confused.",2025-05-21 16:56:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ks2wp7/wanting_a_different_name_sign/
1ks1m0w,deaf,Any grants out there to help us with assistive technology for college? (USA),"Hi, everyone!
My college course is requiring all students to show up day one with our own stethoscopes along with several other items. We are expected to buy these on our own, and if we don't have them on the first day then we can be automatically dismissed from the program. That's not a big deal for most, there are some cheap stethoscopes out there that people can get until they can afford something better.

For me though, that's not the case. I really need a digital stethoscope that will let me use over the ear headphones to listen. If I take my hearing aids out to use a normal stethoscope it's going to be useless for me, so the headphones need to go over my hearing aids. I have trouble with my Bluetooth connection sometimes so I'd rather not risk it and just use headphones .I'm currently looking at the Thinklabs One Digital Stethoscope which is 500 USD. I would be open to anything especially something cheaper but that's just what I've been seeing.

My issue is I definitely can't afford that right now. I need to go to college to make better money, but I now need even more money upfront to go in the first place.

Does anyone know of any grants or assistance that could help with the cost for deaf/HoH individuals? Maybe it's a long shot, but I'm desperately searching for some way of getting what I need.

My vocational rehab counselor hooked me up with an assistive tech specialist who I met with yesterday. She specifically mentioned how she got another client of hers a Bluetooth stethoscope free of charge through vocational rehab/the state disability services for that persons nursing school. 

I would start by contacting your states vocational rehab/disability resource office. It’s obnoxious but call them if you can—I emailed for months and months but when I called I got a meeting right away. I’m on disability so that qualifies me for free services, but they may have other resources if you are not on disability to help cover costs.

Not deaf, but working in a related field. Try reaching out to your state's vocational rehab office! They might be able to either directly help with the cost or steer you to resources who can.

The American Association of Medical Professionals with Hearing Losses has a program where they will loan you a stethoscope to try, for a fee. The website says a sliding scale is available: https://www.amphl.org/stethoscope-equity-project

I've not worked with AAMPHL, so I can't directly vouch for anything, but they do have good information on their website about stethoscope options and related topics.

You can contact your state's vocational rehab office. Open up a case and they may be able to help with the cost of assistive devices. My state also provides free college tuition for deaf/hard of hearing residents but you have to ask to get it.

She lives near us in Portland, OR and her family lives a few states away.  Her parents and brother are deaf, and my family only has beginning ASL skills.  She is graduating from college and my family will be hosting events here.   I would like to hire a person (or a couple people)for a graduation party who can enhance our communication between spoken English and ASL.  I don’t really need a certified interpreter.  I am looking for someone familiar with or in the deaf community that can navigate both languages so our young woman can enjoy her graduation events without worrying how we are all getting along when she is off graduating or her having the feeling that she is the primary person supporting communication between our families.  Basically, I am looking for someone bilingual who can hang out, tell our stories, have some food and get some money for helping out.  I just found out that this was an area of concern for our young woman so the turn around time to get it set up would be the last day in May (about a week and a half).  Would you share your ideas on how I can seek out someone?  Or if you are in the Portland area and interested, reach out?

[댓글]
""I don’t really need a certified interpreter."" I can't speak for the parents and brother, but this can come across as rude. You don't really care to know what they have to say? You don't want your communication to be clear?

You can search for local interpreters or agencies at RID.org. Start now because good interpreters are booked months in advance.

You would likely want to hire an interpreter, or at least an ASL interpreting student.
Interpreting ASL isnt just signs to English. 
The language has a very different grammar and syntax. This takes a lot of brain power and practice to be able to accomplish. 
ASL interpreters are also meant to be able to shift and adapt to different signing styles.
I have been signing for nearly 20 years now but I still CANNOT interpret. I teach ASL classes as part of my job. Yet I cannot interpret even though I am fluent in the language and am surrounded by the Deaf community every day. I can do it for maybe 5 minutes max. It is just not something I have been trained to do.

I would advise asking the girl’s parents what would help in aiding communication. If they are ok with an interpreter, or if they would even be comfortable with someone who knows ASL.
Some Deaf would much prefer to use a speech to text app. Or some prefer writing.
All Deaf folks are different, many of us are used to navigating communication with hearing people, and we have our own preferences. I’d advise you to ask the Deaf people.

Try the local colleges that have interpreter training programs.

Did you ask your son with how her family is accommodating the graduation? I really don’t think they expect you to hire someone as they’re already used to living in the hearing world their entire life. I really think you need to reach out to them first via text before you hire an interpreter. You need to ask, don’t assume.

Thanks all for your insights.  This post was my first delve into this topic.  I hadn’t considered that the graduate/CODA felt responsible to support communication and the timeline to research and find solutions for her event that is less than 2 weeks away, on a Saturday night, is daunting.   She is going to ask her family about finding someone and how they would feel about that.    
I am thinking I would be most comfortable asking the person interpreting to do a Zoom meeting and have them interpret between the graduate and myself.  I am a SLP with skills in determining communication competence and repairing breakdowns, so while not a perfect solution, I think it might be reasonable given the parameters I need to work within.  
For transparency, I took 3 years of ASL in college over 30 years ago.  I took another year of beginning ASL with my parents and daughter about 10 years ago.  But, I haven’t used ASL much with people in the deaf community and thus my skills are rudimentary.   My expressive skills are about a two and a half year old and I really struggle to read and understand signs.    I am sharing this because I think our kids are going to get married.  I am seeking advice to give me insight; I am ignorant of what may be rude and this is my mea culpa.  We are building bridges between our families. My family has some time to work on learning ASL as our probable grand babies grow.  The babies will quickly outgrow me as they learn ASL, but hopefully they will still find me fun even if a bit daft.   I feel the need to navigate our relationship with her family well and for that I need to ask the community.  Thank you again for sharing your knowledge with me.  I may be back With more questions if that is ok by you.  Take care.

Look up an ASL interpreting agency in Portland. Here are 2 options; 

https://www.mosaicinterpreting.com/ 

https://bridgesoregon.org/interpreting-services/

You'll probably pay about $80-100 per hour per interpreter.

This may be a good situation for a certified interpreter mentoring one of the students or newer interpreters.

There’s a Deaf owned cafe on Woodstock, most Sundays I believe they have people learning sign. It’s possible that someone there is a new interpreter who is willing to get some practice at a discount, but it’s a bit of a gamble as there are a lot of new students. If you can afford it, I’d hire a professional

You are a rusty sign language  ? Because you do not hang out with the deaf community to much more than one year where you know about this deaf culture  ? Are your family members are deaf  ??

Well silly-head, how would I keep my glasses on my face without my ears. I can't hear without my glasses.

Too late, I was already born without one. Time for the other I guess lol.

I love it!

No more ear wax and no more ear infection.  You're onto something.

My right ear is purely decorative. I mean, I guess it holds up my sunglasses, but I can wear blackened out steampunk goggles instead. But as an ear, it's dead inside. Much like a corporate employee in a cubicle farm. 

I think if we're going to remove our ears, the best option would be a melon baller because just cutting them off removes the flappy outside part and not the inside parts. So maybe scissors AND then a melon baller. (I already have really cool steampunk goggles).

1krjzp8,deaf,First deaf data scientist??,"Hey I’m deaf, so it’s really hard to do interviews, both online and in-person because I don’t do ASL. I grew up lip reading, however, only with people that I’m close to.

I have been applying for jobs for years, and all the applications ask me if I have a disability or not. I say yes, cause it’s true that I’m deaf.

I wonder if that’s a big obstacle in hiring me for a data scientist? I have been doing data science/machine learning projects or internships, but I can’t seem to get a full time job.

1krcqlg,deaf,"""Rubbish communication and vocal skills.""","It's a bit pathetic for me to post for the first time on this account after three years of being mysterious, but here it is. (lots of words, I know. Also English is not my first language &lt;/3)

I often hesitate to share anything, but I feel the need to vent about communicate and my voice. My first year of college wasn't that bad; I have people around me, but they don’t know British Sign Language (BSL) very well, which is frustrating. Whenever I go out with my friends, it's pretty hard to read their lips when they all speak at the same time. They also find it difficult to understand what I’m saying. There's one person in this group with whom I can communicate easily because she enjoys learning about BSL. She’s not fluent, but she’s good enough. I prefer to text them on my phone, as it’s obviously easier to communicate that way, both inside and outside of college. However, I’ve become tired of texting because it makes me feel like I’m begging them to respond like a creepy ex. i feel like it's should be easy if we can just talk or sign either. Now, this friend group seems to be fading after finishing our first year. (nothing's bad, just busy with their life) Au revoir to them! I’ve moved to a different campus for my second year, hoping to meet many new people and make new friends. Unfortunately, things didn’t go well at first. Someone told me that my voice sounds weird and funny, which embarrassed me right away. They said I sound like a 12-year-old in an insult way, so I quickly silenced myself in my classes (hate this guy). I know it might seem like a weak move, but I got fed up with hearing people who comments like that. This is not first time, and i think about my vocal skills that need to be correct for long time, like since I was child. For the rest of the year, I’ve been trying to teach myself how to speak more clearly, but it never feels like enough. I struggle to put words in the right order when I speak, and I end up mixing everything, which leads to more embarrassment. I just wish I could talk normal, feel normal and more involved in the “hearing” world.

1kr2s9e,deaf,Question regarding on-call,"Hi everyone,

I'm hard of hearing with a moderate to severe hearing loss. I ended up in the computer security (i.e. cyber) industry, and it turns out that a lot of it is IT with some additional security layer-ons. I've been told in my interviews that I need to get some more administrative experience in order to really be good in this field.

It turns out that being an administrator is basically being the parent of a baby: i.e. when something goes wrong, you must attend to them. Larger enterprises have people available through rotational shift-on-call schedules, but sometimes there might be an expectation or a need for me in a job to be on-call at night.

I've been looking at some technological solutions and options, but I'm afraid that even with the strongest measures taken, they might not be enough/suitable to wake me up in the middle of the night when something is going on.

Hey folks,

So there’s a local resource center and afterschool program (think like boys and girls club kind of idea) that has a good handful of hearing students who are interested in ASL. My sister takes classes there so they know my mom and a few years ago asked her if she’d be willing to teach a class, but she works full time. They couldn’t hire me at the time cause I was a minor. 
Now that I’m 18 the subject has come up again. They’re offering pretty good money for me to teach a varying age group twice a week after school. I’m hesitant because I Don’t really know what teaching asl formally involves? And also am hearing ofc. 
My mom thinks I would be totally fine with a little research, and her opinion is that some exposure is better than none for the kids. 

I know Reddit strangers can’t properly assess how equipped I am for this, but I wanted some other opinions. 

I was thinking maybe I could offer to facilitate a club instead? And not formally teach but offer support along with outside resources, accompanying and encouraging at Deaf events, etc. idk if Bill Vicars can hold the attention of 8 year olds but I could probably find something.

1kq7ith,deaf,Cochlear’s vs HA’s - Deaf opinions,"Hi hi! 
Don’t wanna make this super long - really just wanted to know how come Deaf people seem to feel more negatively about CI’s than for e.g. BTE hearing aids? I know every Deaf person is different, and I’m just asking based on what I’ve seen/heard myself, and I find I see more controversy and arguments about CI’s than with other HA’s. Is it cuz of the severity of deafness needed to have CI’s, and Deaf folk feel at that point you shouldn’t try salvage it? I understand feelings on getting little babies implanted because they’re so young, can’t consent, parents not teaching them SL/thinking CI’s just fix everything etc, but I’ve even seen people get really nasty over adults choosing to get implanted, so I was curious! 

[댓글]
Opinions about CIs have changed over the time, but we still have people who are very anti-CIs and they may see adults choosing to have CIs over hearing aids as traitorous. I’ve met some people who are very militant about Deaf Pride having absolutely nothing to do with both HAs and CIs. Like, do not attempt to fix my deafness at all. Those people are becoming a minority, in my experience, as many Deaf parents I know from my Deaf school are more open to their children having HAs and speech therapy. CIs are still a sensitive topic, as it’s still an invasive and more permanent process, and hearing aid technology has improved a lot. But compared to a couple of decades ago, the opinions have become more positive as people are becoming more accepting. We are still combating opinions about not needing to learn ASL, though, as CIs won’t work the same way for everyone, and we are still seeing language deprivation in kids with CIs. 

But yeah, we still have people with very strong opinions, but I’m hoping in a generation or two, they will be basically nonexistent, because our energy should be in making sure all deaf and hard of hearing children have a solid language from birth, no matter what the language is, which means educating parents and medical professionals to share options and not dismissing ASL, since studies show ASL is still beneficial for children who prefer to use spoken language. CIs aren’t a problem; misinformation is.

When an audiologist gives a hearing aid, there may be a conversation about oralism vs. signing. When a doctor recommends a CI, there is often a conversation about ""If you want them to succeed, you must not use ASL"". ASL suppression seems to be much more common with CIs than with hearing aids.

I offer, briefly, my own story: I was born HOH, 1964. In the late 60’s, throughout the 70’s, doctors advised against fitting kids with HA’s. ASL was very much looked down upon, so I never learned it. Grew up knowing I had a hearing loss, but believing I was “hearing”, with a slight caveat. I received my first HA’s at age 24. I have been wearing HA’s for practically ALL my adult life. Never once had a social worker, audiologist, ENT (except for my most recent one) suggest or recommend ASL. Have known very few people who wore HA’s even (except for old people). I’m now exploring my deafness, understanding it, even relishing it! The Hearing World is dominant, I understand this, maybe more than other HOH/Deaf people. Maybe some deaf people resent me because I speak (my ASL skills are a beginner’s, though I do read lips- but no formal speech reading). Some hearing people are shocked I am HOH (you can’t really see my HA’s), and always express amazement that I “speak so well for a ‘deaf’ person.” My attitude is: let each HOH/Deaf person identify him/herself &amp; make decisions for themselves! I distrust rigidity in any form. I have been forced to live as “hearing”, I was ashamed of my hearing disability. I DO NOT hear like normal hearing people, thus I am NOT “hearing”, never have been, never will be! I suspect most CI wearing people think the same way. Sometimes I feel as if I have been a ghost drifting through life. I feel awakened now, actually living! Accepting my deafness has been an amazing experience, one I am fairly new at. I could type much more but nobody here want to read a goddamn book! 🤣 ☮️ &amp; 🤟🏻

You're working on the premise that hearing is everything, and we should cling to the last vestiges.  Some of us are not of that mindset.  CIs do not give sound the way hearing aids give sound. There is a lot to process when the options are surgeon and multiple medical appointments or audiologist visit.

It's an outdated distinction imo - hearing aids used to only work for people with a reasonable amount of hearing naturally, so these folks would probably be oral and living in the hearing world even without devices, whereas CIs were used to force people who were fully deaf and would HAVE to sign and live in the Deaf community if they didn't have devices into the hearing world. Now there are hearing aids that work for profoundly deaf people it's very much the same - I've seen plenty of people my age &amp; younger (and a bit older) forced into oralism with hearing aids just like they are with CIs. CIs do come with (some) medical risks so it's understandable that some people are hesitant about them for that reason, but that's a personal matter more than a reason to be against them on a cultural level. The cultural debate should really be about devices &amp; oralism v sign &amp; not using devices not hearing aids v CIs

Most are fine with the aids themselves nowadays but we deeply dislike the idea to NOT learn sl at all.

Last time I looked there was still a look of physical risks with CI's. Like your chance of meningitis went up by 20x. Complications if your need an MRI. Not all CI's work and its a huge amount of money, time and effort to get it done and to the therapy for it. Not everyone lives in a big city. I met one family who did it and they were an 8 hr drive from the clinic. It's not easy.
I know about a dozen people with a CI. For one, it triggered seizures, another migraines. One child, the family was told for years that it was working but it wasn't and they missed years of communicating with her because they were discouraged from using ASL. Some are neutral about the CI and one woman really loves her. 
Hearing aids don't come with the same physical risks as CI's.

\^ maybe these writings will clarify for you why it is such an emotional issue.

In my opinion, while I know that having access to sound as early as possible is best, there’s a question of consent as well.  Subjecting a young child to invasive surgery that they can’t consent to or choose whether they want it or not.  Technology is improving to the point where CI surgery might not destroy whatever residual hearing the person has, so it may not be as much of an issue going forward, but one of the major reasons I never considered getting CIs was the fact that they couldn’t guarantee that it would be successful and if it wasn’t, the little amount of hearing ability I do have could be gone forever.

I actually met my childhood audiologist as an adult and she is a staunch proponent of CIs and doesn’t understand why anyone would decline to have them.  She also is very damaging to the deaf community in telling parents not to teach their child sign language alongside having a CI - I’ve worked with children who were in her care and they (more often than not) had severe language delays because the CIs didn’t help them as much as they promised the parents.  While I was on extended leave of absence from the agency we both worked for, she told the executive team that sign language is dying out and there was no point in ensuring there were individuals who know sign language on staff.  It has taken me 5+ years to undo the damage she’s done with her misinformation.

I have no doubt that what I am about to say, will make deaf people furious. But the reality is. That being able to hear, is the default position. And you’re better off in life when you can hear. Or else we wouldn’t have this discussion about the deaf community being hateful towards ci. Because if deaf people didn’t struggle, then what’s the problem? And discouraging sl has nothing to do with sl being an issue in general. It can be an issue when you are learning to listen with ci. Therefore they told us that it is better for a 1.5 yo to use all his brain power on learning to listen with the ci. You can always learn sl later on. You can’t necessarily say the same thing about ci. Because in my sons case, it was a matter of weeks if not days, that his cochlea would calcify, and therefore making the outcome of ci’s a lot worse. If they would be working at all.

U know back in 90’s i was force and pushing to get ci and i was against it !!! Same goes other deaf and hoh too and now doctors act like ci are the answer and cure to fix the problem which isn’t true!!!! Ci never gonna works and will not cure deaf/hoh .

Does he feel the same way about eyeglasses or vaccines? Maybe a call to CPS is in order?

Just because he has decided this? I'm very sorry, but this is unacceptable. How old are you?

If you need them and he’s saying no, start with maybe a school counselor or social worker if you have access to one. I absolutely think you are within your right to report this to CPS but a school teacher/counselor/social worker can also help with that. I’m so sorry. You deserve to be believed and given help. ❤️

If you're in the US then you can (and should) ask for a speech therapist, and accommodations for school from your school. Talk to your guidance counselor to get things moving, but as per the ada not having hearing aids will affect the quality of your education, and schools will either provide them or force your parents to give you (the right kind) of hearing aids. You can also get other accommodations like learning ASL or CART.

I say ask for a speech therapist due to the fact that most will(at least mine did) help you get your accommodations and advocate for you and your right to an equal education.

Are you in the US or another country where they aren't covered by public health and if so, can he actually comfortably afford them? Maybe part of it is If he was ambivalent to begin with that might be the final ""nope"" from him. Maybe he doesn't have 1k-10k lying around or it's all he has for emergency money and he doesn't want to use it because you've been getting by and he's afraid ya'll won't be able to get by if he uses it for that and something happens. 

If you are in the US, make sure he knows there are programs like the ones through Lions Clubs, the HIKE Fund, and some state government agencies that can provide them low cost to free for kids whose parents could use the help.

Tell him it’s either pay for hearing aids or he has to pay for your (and his) sign language classes

I’m sorry to hear this and agree with everyone that you deserve a say in the decision.  If your dad does not give a specific reason he may be embarrassed about why not to get them, such as cost. Google untreated hearing loss issues kids and you should not only find issues already mentioned but increased frustration and stress that contribute to poorer grades and mental health problems. We hear with our brains, not just our ears and not feeding our brain information is as bad as starving our bodies. There are far more funding sources for kids needing hearing aids than for adults. You deserve them - it is not charity. The funding is available so you can become the best student and person you can be. That helps all of us.

I want to add an input from something iv dealt with my family members in terms of my child and their hearing aids. They have had them since they were 1.5. The family feels like doctors just push stuff so that big pharma gets money 😒 and they have even gone as far as to do their own ""tests"" on my child like seeing if the child could hear a car going by or that their name was heard, ect. Anyways my point in this is that, especially in small towns people have this idea and it can be vastly wrong. Many doctors are actually good people and want to actually help their patients. Yes there are bad ones, but like come on you took a legitimate hearing test. Children tend to adapt very well when it comes to any kind of disability and hearing loss is no different. You have adapted, but that does not mean you shouldn't get help to. I hope if you want them you can find a way to get them.

Have your dad read [this.](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-hidden-risks-of-hearing-loss)

He is literally putting you at risk in so many ways by being an idiot.

This is YOUR life. I wear a hearing aid and it's phenomenal. It's life changing. You have zero idea how wonderful hearing aids are. You get your life back. Remember, you are responsible for making your owb life better. Go get a hearing test done, get audiologists involved.

Hearing aids actually preserve your hearing. They assist your audio receptors to perceive sound the right way, which stimulates them for longer and slows down degeneration.

You control your life. Not your father. If you want hearing aids and know that it will help you. Find a way to get them.

Assuming you are a minor, I feel sorry for your situation. I can see why you need to vent about it. Losing your hearing can definitely lower your quality of life and that must be very scary at a young age (any age really). If it’s a financial issue please look into organizations that provide aid to help pay for hearing aids or provide low cost hearing aids. If this is a stigma thing, please tell your dad that you are scared about the future. Your deafness maybe liviable now but it can progress as you age. At that point it might be to late to regain the hearing you’ve already lost and hearing aids might not help anymore. This will mean you will have to solely rely on the good ear (assuming one ear is better than the other and you don’t need hearing aids in both). If you need two hearing aids than I can’t imagine a valid reason for your dad to not try his best to get you them.",2025-05-19 00:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kpycru/my_dad_doesnt_want_me_to_get_hearing_aids/

1kpublr,deaf,Is it okay to use a relay service if I am hearing and not calling a deaf person?,"Okay so I’m autistic and for a multitude of reasons cannot do phone calls, and have to get my mum or my carer to do them for me. However, I can communicate via text/live chat. I want to be more independent, and I realised a relay service (relay uk) allows you to communicate via text basically, and I could do that. Many things still require phone calls unfortunately and I think using a relay service would be the only way I could ever do those things independently. However, I feel as I am not who it was designed for, and deaf people ‘need it more’ than me, it would be unethical to do this. Also that I would be ‘taking away’ a service from someone who needs it, so thought I’d come on here and ask actual deaf people what they think. Thanks for reading.

1kpevwy,deaf,Staring too much?,"I've been gradually going deaf over many years. I often manage to communicate fine with people so long as I can see their lips and/or know the topic of discussion so that I can fill in the blanks with what they likely said. For the most part, though it's not my intention to hide it, a lot of people don't know that I'm partially deaf in casual encounters.

 That being said, I have noticed something that has been brought up on more than one occasion that does make me a bit self-conscious. People say that I have a bad tendency of staring? Now I'm not I'm looking at people inappropriately or checking them out or anything crazy like that. I'm very respectful and have more than enough common decency and self-respect to avoid anything like that. I tend to keep my eyes on those around me and my surroundings so that I'm not caught off guard if people are trying to communicate with me or something is going on. Apparently it's something some people find weird or off-putting? Does anyone else experienced this or am I just socially awkward or something?

I'm definitely not trying to make anyone feel uncomfortable, and if it's something that is a problem with just me I suppose I'll have to figure out how to fix it.

1kox01c,deaf,Reading about DallasHearingFoundation.. Is this problematic or am I overthinking it? Felt icky reading it... seems like they send the message that signing is bad and hearing is the only option.,"I'm going to this fundraising gala with my boyfriend who is deaf. It's for a cochlear implant/audiologist /vocal therapy organization. 

I guess I thought it would be a Deaf community event but looking at their website gave me a weird feeling.. isn't the way they are phrasing everything a little off putting? Or is it just me??

[댓글]
Yes, it definitely leans heavily into oralist values and uses negative language around signing.

I know you simply asked if this was off putting, but I would like to expand a bit on why: 

It’s not uncommon for hearing aid/cochlear implant companies/organizations to push their product by focusing on oralist narratives. It’s common for hearing aid and cochlear implant companies - and sometimes even professionals within the field, including Deaf audiologists and advocates - to promote oralist narratives. These often frame hearing devices as the only path to success, especially for children.

There have also been cases where parents are told sign language is harmful, and will stunt language development, even though research proves otherwise. This kind of information is harmful and misleading.

That said, hearing aids and implants are valid tools. They help many people navigate a world that still places the burden of accessibility on individuals instead of creating equal access for all. The issue is not their existence, but how they’re often presented as the only right choice.

You should still consider going. It’s a chance to meet others, hear different perspectives, and learn - though some views might be uncomfortable or even harmful, exposure can still be valuable.

It blames sign for poor English proficiency. Growing up deaf/hoh in Texas in oral only programs, I saw from experience that poor English actually means poor language proficiency because we were all prevented from learning the only language accessible to us and forced into one situation: do English or have language deprivation. Children are hungry for language in all forms. Cornering isn't necessary and it doesn't work.

(adding for any lurking hearies that research has shown that early access to sign increases access to all language, so sign is not to blame for poor English; all these kids who receive no sign during early life have poorer proficiency at language period, because they missed the window.)

I would love to know where they get those numbers. Every source I’ve seen quotes High School graduation to be around 83%  for Deaf compared to a hearing 89%. This seems not only problematic but like total BS!

It sounds like they want to highlight the difficulties Deaf and HH people face in education, but simultaneously putting down sign language as a way to teach children with hearing issues. Honestly disappointing IMO. Correlation doesn't equal causation, and this just highlights how poorly we treat children in education with communication differences.

Besides framing hearing parents as “normal” (what, Deaf parents are chopped liver??) so many of their statistics are incorrect or mis-interpreted. That stat should be the MEDIAN reading level of Deaf is 4th grade. Median is not the same as average. Median means middle. As in half are below 4th grade and half above it. Which gives better context. 

And it ignores the amount of research that teaching ASL helps support learning an L2 such as English. If you don’t have access to a visual language, no matter what your spoken language is, you’ll have many gaps due to not having full access to it. And hearing technology does not give full audio access.

Yeah. You’re not wrong, it’s bad. Yikes.

Here's another excerpt from their website, since I could only post one screenshot.. I do not like the ""miracle"" word choice at all:

Many lives have been profoundly changed by the services provided by the Dallas Hearing Foundation. Our goal is to be able to give the miracle of hearing and speech to every deaf child and adult who needs our assistance. Please help us to assist these deserving individuals through our main fundraising event. Only you can forever change the life of a deaf person. We are so proud of the past assistance we have been able to provide to this community, of the present help we are currently providing, and hope to be able to service even more individuals in need in the future.

On behalf of the deaf children and adults who are waiting for a miracle, thank you for your time and consideration.

Ugh! Oralists! Why not just go and politely question the figures, where did they get the figures from, and report here later? I think they will be a bit more open with telling stuff to hearing people rather than deaf people.

Yet another reason I do not love in TexASS

Deafinitely audist.

A long time ago, I became a teacher because I saw how bad education was in Deaf schools including the one I attended. 

Only when I became a teacher, I realised this wasn't the problem. 

Deaf children not getting the first gasp of a language, let alone, actually communicate in a language at home regularly enough, was the reason. 

Even if you bring in the best teacher in the world and even if the children spend a lot of time learning with that teacher with a little disruption, it's still not enough.

I no longer teach. It's pointless teaching Deaf children using a syllabi created by hearing people. What language deprived Deaf children need is specialised education that accounts for language deprivation.

I live in Dallas; I am familiar with DHF, though far from an expert. I am acquainted with people from DHF, and Deaf Action Center here in Dallas (which DHF lists as a resource). I was born HOH, but did not receive hearing aids until I was 23. I have lived my entire life in the hearing world, believing I *was* “hearing”. I am *not* “hearing”, never have been. Do I hear? Yes, moderately in my right ear, very little in my left. I am, at age 60, only beginning to understand &amp; explore my deafness. I am now beginning to learn ASL. I am new to the Deaf Community, and only realizing the battle lines drawn. I do *not* judge anyone. My own story, briefly shared here, is mine. I do not sign/speak for anyone else. I’m learning. So I withhold judgement. My heart is open to ALL deafened people. I might get attacked for not expressing a certain opinion. I may be attacked for seemingly “defending” a certain opinion. Look me in my eyes and tell me “oh you’re hearing” and I will tell you, “no you’re very wrong!” Look me in my eyes and tell me, “you have no place in the HOH/Deaf Community!” I *AM* HOH! And that’s my identity! God bless each &amp; every one of you. 🤟🏻☮️

Just another oralist group ignoring the fact that the average American reads at a 7th grade level, like always. Literacy problems aren't exclusively a Deaf issue.

I feel like questioning everything after the fourth point. A few I can't speak for as I'm only deaf in one ear and HoH in the other. But it feels like downplaying the Deaf community. For example, the point saying that due to education and communication, the community isn't proficient in English. Now I know ASL is its own language with its own grammatical rules. But I'm sure that when combined with reading level that they can be proficient enough to understand via reading (beyond 3rd grade level) or if they read lips. I'm darn sure they're aware there's differences and can still understand.

Overall this feels harsh and putting the community as ""lesser than."" It doesn't feel explanatory in a helpful manner.

I know in my area there isn't a school for the Deaf. Not that I know of anyway but we do have Deaf and deaf people. As well as HoH. I only know bc my son when he was still at a charter school (he's in high school now) there was a Deaf student and he felt protective of him bc the teachers had no patience. Sadly the student had such a bad experience that he left the school. I'm sure it was because the parents felt it wasn't a welcoming school. Broke my heart the stories my son would tell me.

Slowly but surely were helping ""convert"" our support team but our SLP is still so hesitant that we've chosen a bilingual, bicultural approach. My son, B, has moderate to severe HL bilaterally and when I learned we decided to do both languages. It's such an old way of thinking, and so ablist.

I'd like to add that we're not perfect but he certainly is 🥲. We sign mostly SEE right now but our ASL consultant is so helpful.

It looks like there isn’t really any acknowledgment of audism, language deprivation, etc. which absolutely contribute to the deaf people who don’t become proficient in English, read at a 3rd grade level, don’t graduate from high school and/or college, etc. Like they point out these problems but not that audism and language deprivation are very directly linked to those. 

This feels gross, especially since it seems like there is nothing promoting sign language or encouraging hearing family members to learn sign language for their deaf kids/siblings etc.

i (HoH) agree- it's the passive aggressive, backhanded comments for me. ""Born to normal hearing parents"". Hearing parents works just fine. I can understand how to an audist it would make sense for a deaf or HoH person to be ""unnatural"" but by casually putting that label on people insinuates that its strange or not right to be deaf. I don't know, I'm probably over thinking it but it ticks me off.

I grew up with normal hearing before abruptly losing it, so I'm not a helpful contribution to this post, but I can say that as someone who learned ASL later in my childhood, it actually didn't do to much to my previous grammar knowledge. I don't use english quite as much as before, but I can revert back to it easily-- so I recommend teaching both simultaneously, even if its just on paper, not pronunciation (thats an 'easy' fix with a speech pathologist).

I recently came across another organization like this based out if the LA area called ""No limits for Deaf children"". In a phone call, I was informed it was all English language/speech therapy based and no signing....I was SHOOK. My daughter is non-verbal. I told them I didn't think they would be of help to our family and that ""if we're not teaching Deaf kids sign, I don't know what we're doing."" I also may have told her the program audist.

""Subtitles not available in your language.""

Should read not available in any language. Ah the frustration.

I was a kid in the 80’s, back when TVs didn’t have built in decoders and you had to get external decoder units to hook up to your tv. One of the requirements for a captionist job in these days being you needed to consistently type 120wpm. At least there were actual people (mostly) proofreading captions.

I hate this automated CC crap. I can’t even display captions in full screen on YouTube. What the hell is that shit? I can’t read it in normal mode.

I've been complaining (to myself) about this also, when I go to the movies.

On the rare occasion that I use captiview, a few of the trailers will generally be captioned, but I haven't seen an open captioned trailer in months.

As to streaming, that generally works for me except I can't watch Last Week Tonight unless I wait because the captions on the most recent episode are always a second behind. I complained to HBO years ago.

i’m so glad to know i’m not the only one who is annoyed by this too!!

I don't think you can make manual caption on youtube anymore. It's only automated.

try to dwnload mx plyer for videos &amp; then watch the film from it ( u could dwnload subtitles from this app )

It's incredibly frustrating, but at this point I've just decided that if they don't want to put in the effort to market towards me effectively, then clearly they just don't want my money, and I'm not going to give it to them. If I can't understand your trailer or advertisement,  I'm not buying your product.

You can download a transcription app on her tablet or use the internal one if it’s good. Then buy a Bluetooth clip-on microphone to wear and connect it to the tablet.

As other have said, a transcriber. 

I like Live Transcribe and Ava. 

I prefer using them with a ""lapel mic"" is someone is speaking far away from me (a meeting or something like that). 

You can get them for under 20 dollars on Amazon. 

Type in Lapel Mic and you'll find a bunch! 

The ""receiver"" plugs into the phones charging port and the mic connects to the receiver. 

It sends your voice directly to the transcriber and for me, I get better transcription.

Try using live transcribe on an Android. I reverse the colors and use white text on black background. The letters can be enlarged (at least on a phone) so she can rest a larger font while the device is set on something (music stand?) and still be able to see you and read along. Also give her everything in writing beforehand. Another option would be filming you with a small webcam and using Zoom on her tablet with captions.

He likes to party. One night when he was out with his wife they met a group of deaf people, not exactly sure how. Well, he ended up inviting them back to our apartment at like 2AM to continue the party. Now that I type it sounds like a bad roommate but not the case. He knew me well enough to know that I wouldn't care due to both of us not having duty the next day. We had a pretty good time, played beer pong, watched two deaf dudes argue over a girl. That was intense. We had some fun drunk conversations typing out texts on our phones and showing them to each other.

Literally there are announcements warning people of it, although ya'll might not even know that.

1kodv0z,deaf,"I want to help my deaf sister, but I also want my own life. Am I selfish?","I’m a hearing person, and my older sister was born with a hearing disability. No one in our family (uncles, aunts, parents, grandparents, cousins) knows sign language. They’re all hearing, and they didn’t understand how important it was to get her help early. My sister didn’t see a doctor until she was five years old.

My mom’s side of the family used to say that I was born because my sister couldn’t hear that they had me to “help” her and take care my mom at her elderly age. 

My sister didn’t go to school until she was 13, when she entered a deaf school learn for CSL. Then, at 17, we moved to the U.S., and she started learning ASL but it was a completely new experience. She didn’t know English, and she had to learn an English based sign language without knowing either language fluently.

At age 21, she was forced to leave school due to her age. She then entered a disability services program, which later declined in quality. We transferred her to another program that served people with more severe hearing and developmental disabilities. Now she’s 30.

She recently took an English assessment at a community college and couldn’t understand anything. She didn’t even know how to begin. And that moment hit me really hard.

A year ago, I realized I can’t live my whole life trapped in the same cycle as my mom’s side of the family and being their accessories. I’ve spent so much of my life taking care of them being the interpreter, caretaker, emotional support, nanny, baby sitter. I used to know CSL as a kid, but I lost it after moving to the U.S. because I had to focus on learning English and taking care of everything at home.

Now I’ve realized:

* My sister doesn’t know CSL or ASL well.
* She doesn’t understand English.
* She doesn’t know how to learn.

And I want to help her… but I also want my own life. I want to grow, have a future, and be more than just the caretaker everyone expects me to be. I feel selfish, and at the same time, I know I’ve already given so much.

I’ve started relearning ASL, and I still want to support her but I’m tired. I don’t know what more I can do. I’ve been living for other people for so long. I still want to help my sister, but I'm poor and I just start my career.

I can see that you really care about your sister and are shouldering an enormous burden. Your experience is the genuine article - delayed diagnosis, lack of early language access, and the vast “burden” on hearing family members who refuse to learn sign.

All things considered, part of your message inadvertently reinforces stereotypes of Deaf people as helpless or unable to learn. Deaf people have a culture and a community with our own language and strengths - although we might face challenges because of delayed intervention.

This kind of post may also be better suited for a community focused on caregiving, or family support, where others may give more insight and practical tips.

It's important to look at your sister as a whole person with potential, not just as a needy person. And it's okay for you to want your own life and future without feeling guilty of being selfish.

Please seek out Deaf-led services and organizations that empower and support - both for you and your sister. There may be local groups or organizations that are able to help you.

Hey you sound very caring but your parents neglected both of you. Your parents should have been the ones doing most of the caregiving, interpreting, advocating, etc for her. Expecting one of their kids to do that instead is neglect. 

Your sister’s situation is the unfortunate (but also somewhat common) result of growing up as the only deaf person in a family that doesn’t know sign language In a country where disability rights and support services are lacking compared to other places. On top of that, she was prevented from having access to normal kid experiences such as going to school and learning various skills. This scenario usually leads to the deaf person developing an intellectual disability as they grow up. Her current life situation is not your fault. 

Honestly, how much you remain involved is up to you. *You don’t have to remain involved if you don’t want to- you don’t have to clean up after your parents’ mistakes. You are not a bad person if you want to focus on yourself and your own life, especially for the time being.* 

If you do want to stay involved, I think the most effective thing you can do at this point is advocate for placement in a group home or similar supported living situation in which staff are familiar with sign language and how to work with deaf ppl (not easy to find but they do exist). Not sure if she has a guardian but guardianship could be another way to advocate. You both need to be surrounded by a system of people and support services who can take care of your sister’s needs so you don’t have to do it (alone).

This is not your responsibility. Please go live your life and always show your sister unconditional love. 

What happened to your sister was extreme neglect and is on your parents and their community. Shame on them! This is why I became a teacher. I hate seeing this happen to deaf kids being deaf myself. A lot of deaf kids who transfer to deaf schools are usually very delayed in language and social skills. Unfortunately, we get a lot of crap for what hearing ppl did to these kids. We try our best. 

Extreme cases like your sister just…. Is a group home situation. 😔

Adults like your sister at her level of communication usually live in group homes. Your parents should look one up especially with a Deaf community. She will be happier and you’ll feel so reassured.

Hi there, I am Chinese and I am deaf. Is there any chance that you live in Minnesota? I know Minnesota has a strong Deaf community that supports integration of foreign Deaf people, and also has a CSL instructor. It is the only state that I know of with this program. I’ve DM’d you with more info if you’d like to connect offline.

Hey, thank you all for leaving comments. I just want to add a bit more. Since I was young, I’ve been trained to act as a helper for my family to take over the role my aunts once had, and to give back to the whole family because they spent time and money to bring us here (What my grandma said).I’ve talked to my mom about my sister’s situation and asked questions like: “Why didn’t my sister see a doctor earlier?” ""Why didn't she went to other hospitals""“Why didn’t she go to school sooner?” “Why didn’t you do any research to understand her needs or plan for her future?”

Her answers are usually either “I don’t know what to do” or “I don’t remember"" or ""We are poor""

Just for context: my father passed away when I was young.

Language deprivation can lead to permanent difficulties to learn things as it impacts the brain. Compare with Genie (the “feral” girl)
This is how some deaf people get the stigma of being “slow” - it is the foundation that was missing and brain never given the chance to be primed in the age critical phase (if I remember correct if you’re deprived of language by 4 years of age you get lasting impacts on your brain, and the severity getting worse the longer you’re deprived) 
  
She was unfairly treated and deprived caused by her own parents.

But with that said, it isn’t your responsibility beyond normal sibling level to take care of her. You have a right to your own life too.

Your parents treated both of you poorly. She for being abandoned and you for becoming the caregiver/parentification against your will.

I don’t know how she should be handled in US (I don’t life there) but I suspect something from a caregiver/support person 
  (not you, someone from official channel) to group home depending on how able she is to take care of herself.

Living in a hearing family that doesn’t sign is like being trapped inside a cage that is in a room full of people who “love” you (but they are not caged and they have the key to YOUR cage but choose to keep it locked). Please get your sister connected with people who sign. The only way she can learn ANYTHING, much less language is if it is accessible to her on a regular basis.

I had to look up CSL - correct me if I'm wrong, Chinese Sign Language? And you moved here when your sister was 17, she got removed from school at 21 and she's currently 30? 

How old were you when you 1. Learned csl? 2. Moved to the usa? 3. Learned ASL (the 1st time)? 4. How old are you now/where are you at in life? Because there's a huge difference in moving here at 5 vs 10 vs 15, as well as if you're currently 15 or 20 or 25. I'm assuming you're younger based on how you describe things. 

And lastly you're not selfish. You deserve to have your own life, and I understand you want to help your sister without basically being her caretaker 24/7. The questions above might help us understand what your sister's able to do on her own. I wonder if she never really had a good grasp on CSL- which would result in being language deprived, which unfortunately makes her life difficult. (Lack of language is why toddler's often have meltdowns and temper tantrums)

You might need a new schema for viewing this. The options aren’t simply help or not help. If someone is dependent on you, another option is to transition them to independence. That also isn’t everything or nothing, that’s each facet and each way she’s dependent on you. (Or your family is)

It also sounds like being Deaf isn’t the actual reason your sister needs help, it’s permanent damage from the lack of education and interaction at a young age. The fact without one, the other wouldn’t have happened, doesn’t make it the source of the problem. The issue is the neglect. 

None of this is your responsibility, but it also seems like your sister will fall through the cracks if you don’t help, not through your fault, but the cruelty of others and the world we’re in. 

To me the best way forward is to put the support and help you offer, as much as you can, into attempts to transition to independence (classes for living alone skills, finding group homes, setting them up with educational apps to work on language, helping navigate those slow bureaucratic processes) and ways you’d want to support even if they were independent (learning ASL yourself and the two of you practicing English together). 

With the scale of neglect causing disability, from what you’ve written, it might also be possible that your sister would qualify to be a ward of the state even though they are an adult. Your parents aren’t stepping up enough and if you aren’t willing to do it, that might actually be the best path to get support and resources. Also it might mean the state pays for services that might be too draining for you or your family. If you want to step away in the near or long term…setting that up, where they have a social worker acting as guardian, might be the path that both ensures your independence and ensures your sister gets the care they need because of the neglect they endured in childhood.

No, you're not selfish. It's your parents' responsibility to make arrangements for her care, not yours. I'm just sad she was so delayed in language learning that she permanently developed cognitive issues. She may need to be in LTC for the rest of her life.

Hi OP, I can very closely relate to your situation . I’m in my mid 20s and have the same dilemma with my aunt . I don’t think you’re selfish at all. And I completely understand how you’re feeling :(

I didnt know what CSL is but i knew its part of sign language. Googled.. Chinese Sign Language. Correct? Um Im deaf. I have large family. All hearing. They dont really sign but several fingerspell Its not really impt to know everything to help ur sister if u care abt her. Its ok that u dont have to learn signing or anything else I feel that shecan learn herself. I understand your feelings but u can manage by instead of ""helping"" her, guide by encouraging her to be independent. Theres many opportunities for her to be part of deaf people like herself  Theres deaf @ online Many websites for the deafs especially for churches, schools, clubs,camps &amp; etc.. If its not what ur sister has in mind, then encourage her to see something u know abt like if u are doing smtg or joining Have her be part of the experience so shed see more abt herself that she may be able to do more to see opportunities out where shed be independent. Pls try to be patient w/ ur sister. I understand the stress and not having ur own life but try for a year or so to see how she will turn out U can try to google onlines/websites where deaf people are part of Reach out and find out info so u can show ur sister what u ve googled on I think u can try abt local interpreted service/ or deafchurches or local deaf clubs However ask her abt what she thinks or if she wants to find out herself Jst guide/encourage her without expectation so she wont feel that she needs ur help! Also, itd make her trust u more since u let her have choices with respect by jst suggestin or guiding her to see whatever she can do Theres several states in the US where most deaf populated areas are NY, CA, Wash D.C, Mass., Fla, Texas, MD, &amp; few others.. U can find out from local church interpreters or deaf activities Hope ull not feel overwhelmed:) which is very normal esp. dealing with someone like ur sister but shes fine. She doesnt hear though isnt stupid. I think she jst need encouragement:) Thats all! Say hello to her for me👋 Take care ~ P.

Unfortunately stories like your sister’s are all too common. I don’t enjoy putting down any of your family members, but from what you mentioned I can confidently say the parents are to blame. Big time. Like this is child abuse and neglect. I still don’t understand how hearing parents can sleep at night when they neglect their deaf children like this. It’s pure evil. They have set your sister back decades with their selfishness. 

You are not your sister’s keeper, but your sister is your parents’ responsibility. They failed, not you. Now if your sister is an adult, she is not a helpless child. Deaf people don’t need life-long caretakers. They need the same thing everyone needs growing up: education and a community. 

If you really do want to help her while still maintaining independence for both of you, the best thing you can do is connect her with the resources and community she needs to begin building language skills, both ASL and written English. Do what you can to get her started, then it’s up to her to put in the work for herself. You can continue to be available for support but keep healthy boundaries. 

My wife is Deaf and I am hearing. She is not my burden, she is not dependent on me, and we both do have our own lives. While I do a lot of interpreting, I never see it as a burden. It’s my pleasure and I know she’d do the same for me if the tables were turned. That aside, if we had never met I know my wife would have done excellent things regardless! She is as independent as any hearing person. All thanks to education and awareness.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

No, you are not selfish for being unable to care for your sister around the clock—you have your own future to consider and care for. Have you contacted Medicaid to explore the possibility of a respite care case worker and enroll her in the Long-Term Services and Supports Programs? These programs can help coordinate care for her, whether at home or in a group setting, so you can focus on your own life.

What you see about your sister's struggles is called language deprivation when she was a small child - you need to address and call out on your parents for not being the best parents in the first place. And there are many services out there that does not require her to attend community college but more of training school or classes. I'm not sure where you and your sister is located in the US - if it is in New York, LA or DC, there are Deaf-run facilities that provide the services.

Have you considered taking your sister to see a mental health counselor who is deaf? One who can understand her feelings and help her express herself more clearly? Therapy is often the first step for hearing families to get help with understanding what their deaf family member is trying to tell them. Your sister’s statement about only wanting to socialize with deaf people at vocational rehabilitation suggests to me that she doesn’t know that she’s capable of doing more. She probably assumed that she is not allowed to do any normal adult stuff. Loneliness confused her. She might also benefit from occupational therapy. They help with life and social skills. Can she work in retail or something that is easy for her during the day while you are doing something else? Keep your life in balance to be able to help her effectively. Avoid burning yourself out. Most people do not have choice to be caregiver.

This is crazy.

I also had to learn English based sign language without knowing English.

I think it be cool if you became an interpreter period. It would be beneficial for you and your sister. I’m hard of hearing and have a hard time learning things. None of my family knows sign language , so why bother learning it if no one will want to communicate. I signed one time in public and my mom hates it. So, I don’t do it.",2025-05-16 22:35:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kodv0z/i_want_to_help_my_deaf_sister_but_i_also_want_my/
1kodl24,deaf,Question from a parent of a HoH child.,"In your opinion is it okay to walk up to a deaf person if you see them in public? The other day my boys and I went to the store and I saw a elderly man waiting in his car and he had a cochlear implant and I waved and smiled to be polite but I so badly wanted to talk to him for a bit. 
For context:

My son (5) is hard of hearing and is learning. We are still trying to figure out what is causing the hearing loss but we have also just always signed to him. 

I am hearing and learning sign. I have also gone to a few deaf chats in my community but I have not met this man there.

[댓글]
It’s a very loaded question and I feel like some of the comments are deeply unfair here not to mention rude, 

My personal take here though is as much as I hate ignorance with my disability I really do not like it when random people I don’t know come up to me and start asking questions on my disability, it’s hard enough for me to be social as a deaf person just shopping let alone having to converse with others, add to that I have severe anxiety so that’s another potential you don’t know.

I also find it really insulting when some random comes up to me and starts signing at me expecting me to know it then they get confused and butthurt when I can’t sign back

I honestly commend you for wanting to ask more but please stick to asking forums
A lot of people just want to be left alone when shopping

I have had people come up to me to talk about my CIs. I always welcome it. Haven’t had a kid (or parent with a kid) come up to me, but I’d be totally fine with it if they did.

If we're in a public place and not obviously busy/in a hurry etc it's fine imo, being open to questions and prepared to educate people is how we improve things, personally I like being asked questions!

Please don't make assumptions about how he communicates though - not all deaf people sign, or speak (even if they're using a hearing device), or even use English/ASL at all (we travel too!). It's fine to start with one or the other if course but follow the deaf person's lead if they reply to you in a different way

I’d recommend looking into getting a Deaf mentor! This would be an adult who is specifically designed to be a mentor to you and your family.
I am a Deaf mentor and I talk to families about everything from devices, schools, family gatherings and so much more! Many of them will also help you learn sign language. Many of them are state programs currently. Depending on your area depends on the Deaf mentor programs available.

Deaf person: *exists in public*

OP: it's bc **my** kid is HoH and this is a learning opportunity.

Smdh.

I’m gonna suggest maybe getting a vibe just like you would with anyone else. Continue to start with waving and smiling, if he seems interested in a convo, then go from there. If he seems busy (doesn’t respond, or quickly turns away… body language), then don’t engage. Don’t push it. Agree with others also, maybe just have a normal conversation and not one focused around his CIs to start. And keep in mind he may not sign. It all depends on the person. 

I have hearing aids and people typically don’t notice them (they are bright but tiny), but I do have a different physical disability and when it comes to asking questions or approaching me about it, I am firmly in the camp of it’s hella annoying, please let me live my life, I am not here to be your or your kid’s encyclopaedia nor disability buddy. But like depending on my mood I’m usually up to normal small talk with other people in a store! (I have enough hearing with my aids that it’s not an issue with me but that may also be a consideration)

Agree with continuing to pursue resources dedicated to socializing your child and exposing him to the Deaf/HOH community!

Edit: adding to someones now deleted comment thread 
He’s 5. And goes to bed at 5:30. Deaf chat is at 6:30ish in my town and end around 9-10. Deaf people talk a lot at deaf chat and even I still have a hard time keeping up with all of them. He is still learning and also this is very very new for him. He has just started losing his hearing.

Generally speaking, follow the same social rules you would with anyone else. For example if someone looks busy or is minding their own business, leave them alone. I’d be freaked tf out if some stranger came up to me when I was waiting in my car. If you are in a social setting and it would otherwise be appropriate to talk to people then yes of course you can talk to deaf people.

Depends on the person, personally if someone came up to ME I'd be very uncomfortable but I've had circumstances where my work needed me to interpret (I hear really well ) for a dead customer and we'd connect because they never seen a deaf person working retail. I see some deaf people in public too sometimes but I leave them alone because I respect privacy. Unless you're running into these people at public deaf gatherings, judge from your eyes if it's good to approach or not.

right, as a profoundly deaf young adult with cochlear implants, from time to time i do get parents of deaf children, most commonly those with children with cochlear implants. i don’t ever find it offensive, sometimes catches me off guard, but that would happen with anyone, especially parents with young children!! 

it’s so hard to be a parent of a deaf child, and just talking to someone older can really help!! so yes it is a case by case basis but i welcome questions!! :))))

Omg I’ve a parent of a deaf child and I’ve wondered this exact same thing. I feel some solidarity when I see other families in public. But I’ve never been brave enough to say anything. Lol

Hm. It really depends.

Just based on my observations, people with CIs tend to be guarded of themselves due to the negative perceptions of CIs. I'm from Deaf family of many generations - I am OK with Deaf people wearing the CIs. Some does not. But there is another layer, many people who has CIs simply don't want to ""associate"" with Deaf or HoH people at all in spite of having CI(s) themselves.

I look forward to seeing the responses here! My daughter is almost 16 now, but thru the years, I've wondered the same thing! There's actually only been once that I didn't initiate a conversation; we were at a hospital, and I didn't want to bother. They were always a positive interaction.

Would you do the same to a person in a wheelchair?  And really at 5 I don’t think it’s for your son’s benefit.",2025-05-16 22:22:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kodl24/question_from_a_parent_of_a_hoh_child/

Just got news tonight, that my 11 year old niece has no longer hearing capability on her right ear and slowly loosing as well her left ear.

Would like to move her to school specialized in deaf and mute so she can catch up with her studies and learn sign language as well.

Any reco for private schools or institutions please in the Philippines that could help.

[댓글]
Does *she* want to move to a deaf school? If not, her current school where she already likely has friends should provide her with appropriate accommodations. Maybe she needs live captions if she doesn't know sign language, and if she's 11, she may have grown up like a hearing kid, speaking, listening and not signing. Putting her into a place where she cannot communicate effectively (with signs) would likely be traumatic. Could she start learning sign language for a year, in her home school before she's uprooted entirely?

first of all, STOP saying deaf and mute, that's outdated language. it's just Deaf. transferring her to a Deaf school is a good idea, she will need full immersion to pick up on sign language. I highly recommend all family members learn sign language to combat the ""dinner table syndrome"" where everyone talks but leaves out the deaf family member by saying ""nevermind"" ""I'll tell you later"" ""it's too complicated to explain right now""

good luck

Shouldn't they be attempting to accommodate you?

Is there a mobile app attached to the system? Is there a way you can use a lighting system like lifx? Do you sign? Can you use your videophone number? I'm trying to think outside the box a bit.  Smiles.

Your phone both apple and androids should be capable of detecting sounds.. the tricky part is does it recognize the specific sound... I would try this acceptability feature first if that doesn't not work then I would press for the condo owners association to provide reasonable accommodations to alerting.

I apologize stupid question possibly.

Does this impact your phone?

I use the Live Transcriber sound detection and it seems to work well.

Can you tell us more about this entry system?  

Does it ring your cell phone or does it ring a phone bolted to your wall in your condo?  

When you say you have to answer it, does that mean you only have to answer or do you also have to press a button? 

If this is a land line phone, where you have to answer and then press # or * you could get a phone answering machine for under $20 on Amazon and have it answer after just one ring. Then for the ""greeting"" message have it play the DTMF tone of the button you need to press. 

Now the downside of course is that this will let in anyone that calls your unit. So keep that information to yourself :)

If you get the newer lightbulbs, they can be usedto alert to different sounds like the doorbell or the phone.",2025-05-16 06:11:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kntv4j/deaf_in_condo_building/

Hi there. I empathise with you on this, I’m 55F have been profoundly deaf with hearing aids since very young. I was in denial as a young person, but I managed fairly well lip reading. Covid and mask wearing changed all that, I had to tell everyone and was pleasantly surprised with most people and how they adjusted to help me. I now tell everyone (almost) on meeting as I’ve no choice due to deteriorating this past year. I point to my ear and say I don’t hear well, it puts the other person at ease as I find if I don’t tell them they get embarrassed. Being upfront, puts you both at ease and takes away that worry that we have when interacting with people. I have often avoided certain situations because it’s exhausting at times and don’t be afraid to rely on others to help. It takes time to get used to strange voices and lip read strange faces, I find most people very considerate once I tell them. Go for it, we’ve spent too long being labelled dim, ignorant etc. There is definitely much more empathy and awareness now.",2025-05-16 04:29:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kns9l0/introducing_yourself_and_being_deaf/

Most people I know who are deaf/HoH have a normal voice and speak somewhat fluently. However, my voice sounds more like nasal stuff going on? I’ve always called it a “deaf/hearing loss accent” because I constantly get told I am a foreigner.  

It’s not a “oh my voice is a little nasaly”, no it’s extremely nasaly and I was curious if anyone else experienced something similar?

I'm just the opposite.  Most Deaf/HH people i know have Deaf accent,  kind of nasal is the way it was describe to me.

Most deaf/HoH people I know have the “accent” !
I think only one Deaf friend of mine has a “normal” accent - because he has only very slight hearing loss in one ear and moderate-severe in the other so can still hear himself well 
But the rest have the nasally sound you talk of :) 
Nothing to be ashamed of!

We call it Deaf accent, and many DHH people have it. Totally normal. What I find interesting is that most DHH people you know don’t have it, because I want to say it’s the opposite for many of us. I don’t hear well enough to be able to distinguish voices from each other, and that includes accents, but I’d assume a DHH person has the accent until I’m told otherwise.

U are same as i am

I don’t know that I have the “accent”. Perhaps it’s because I grew up without HA’s, so learned to speak “properly” (I did have some speech therapy as a kid). Maybe because I am not profoundly deaf? Idk…I do know I speak loudly when I don’t have my HA’s in! Could it be I don’t hear my voice?!? Probably.

I've noticed that with my hearing aids my voice is very clear. I don't have a deaf accent despite the fact that I'm deaf. But then when I take my hearing aids off if I'm tired or especially when I'm tipsy, it's much harder to speak clearly. My friends say I slur a bit and skip over some sounds in words. It's not the drunk slur, but rather a combination of not being able to hear my voice and being too tired to put extensive effort into sounding ""normal""

So sometimes I have the deaf accent, sometimes I don't.",2025-05-16 03:53:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1knrmmh/hoh_voice/
1knjhac,deaf,Losing Bridges of Oregon Advocates,"I'm so upset. After all the advocating to get my daughter Deaf advocates, now DHS is losing funding for Bridges Oregon, which means we lose our advocates. Please give it a read and a share, let's get the word out and fight for continued services! This has been sent to DHS, Senators Wyden and Merkley and cross posted on all my socials!

""To Oregon State Legislators and Department of Human Services Leadership,

I am writing to express my urgent and unequivocal objection to the defunding of Deaf Advocacy Services within Oregon’s Department of Human Services (DHS). As the parent of a Deaf minor—my 15-year-old daughter, I have experienced firsthand the systemic inequities that Deaf Oregonians face. Eliminating these services is not only a moral and ethical failure; it may constitute a violation of federal and state mandates designed to protect individuals with disabilities.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS 659A) affirm the right of Deaf individuals to equal access to services, education, healthcare, and public accommodations. Deaf Advocacy Services are not ancillary—they are foundational in ensuring that these legal rights are upheld. Their absence will lead to disproportionate harm, particularly for Deaf youth and families navigating complex systems that are not designed with their needs in mind.

My daughter is intelligent, capable, and deserves the same opportunities as her hearing peers. Yet we have faced multiple instances of systemic neglect and exclusion. Educational institutions have failed to provide timely and appropriate accommodations, leading to delays in learning and social isolation. Medical settings have overlooked her right to communication access, forcing me to advocate under pressure for basic interpreter services. These are not isolated incidents—they are patterns of systemic inaccessibility that require expert, culturally competent advocacy to address.

Deaf Advocacy Services have been a lifeline. Advocates have stepped in where state systems failed—educating institutions about their legal obligations, ensuring that IEP meetings were equitable, and holding service providers accountable. Their removal sends a clear and devastating message: that Oregon is willing to sideline the needs of its Deaf citizens, particularly its most vulnerable.

Defunding these services jeopardizes the state’s compliance with federal civil rights law. It also undermines Oregon’s stated commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion. I call on the Oregon State Legislature to immediately restore and protect funding for Deaf Advocacy Services and to recognize the long-term fiscal and human cost of failing to provide accessible services.     This is not a matter of budget efficiency; it is a matter of legal obligation and human dignity. Oregon has the opportunity—and the responsibility—to be a leader in disability justice. I urge you to act accordingly.

Sincerely,

Rachelle Hinkle

Constituent and Advocate""

1knidby,deaf,"Movie Thoughts for Interpreters, HoH, and Deaf?","Part of my work is planning events for Deaf, HoH, and interpreters-in-training. They're part of a college program and range in ages from 18-21. We intend to have a movie night, and I want to pick the best movie we can for an audience of primarily Deaf students. 

My first thought was 'A Quiet Place' or 'A Quiet Place 2'. But while researching I came to the question, is it even scary from a Deaf &amp; HoH perspective? I realized that the main goal is not making sound, which makes noise the scary part. Alot of the moments of tension are because we (the audience) hear them make noise and we know what's coming. Of course there are captions to indicate a noise was made, but is that enough to feel scary?

Another idea is 'CODA'. But, while the family proves they don't need her, the movie still revolves around the notion of her family ""holding her back"" because they're Deaf. There are some implications that because they're Deaf they struggle to be independent. But this is a group of university students, academically excelling in a variety of majors. They have an Interpreter in class and large events. But besides that they themselves decide when to schedule an Interpreter if they want one. They live by themselves in apartments near campus, doing just fine with no Interpreter around. So I'm not sure if they'd respond well to the movie or just feel annoyed. Any insight?

Thanks!

Most people in the Deaf community have seen any movie that has ASL in it. Usually the community tries to watch them quickly to support ASL usage, so they’re likely to have seen them already. Does it have to be a Deaf themed movie? Is there not something else you guys could watch?

It just depends what you’re trying to focus on. There aren’t a lot of Deaf movies that are clean cut like marvel. 
You’re going to find issues with every movie, my suggestion is you make it a vote and choose from the top 5 after consideration. 

Since you’re hearing and planning events for Deaf/HoH folks, it’s important to involve them in the decision-making. Their input not only helps make better choices, but also builds trust and strengthens the community. These events often involve sensitive topics, and having people who truly understand the culture can make a big difference.


Here’s some resources you might like:

https://deafmovie.org/titles/
https://dcmp.org/

Annndd here’s my take on the movies:

CODA does a great job representing ASL and Deaf culture - it’s a must watch for anyone in or joining the community.
While it focuses mostly on the hearing child’s (CODA’s) experience, it still highlights important Deaf issues like identity and independence. These are things many of us deal with at different points in life. It’s a solid choice for both its representation and overall quality.

A Quiet Place is a strong pick because it doesn’t treat Deafness as a burden. There’s minimal dialogue, which creates tension for hearing viewers, while Deaf viewers naturally have full visual access. It doesn’t use much sign language, but it does feature a Deaf actor and offers solid entertainment overall.

Some other picks you’ll probably see:

Sound of Metal

It’s a classic that’s often recommended. The lead is a hearing CODA, and some of the ASL isn’t fully fluent. Reactions are mixed, but it’s still a decent watch - hearing audiences especially like the sound design. Deaf like the medical vs. cultural commentary. Overall, it’s enjoyable, but it feels more made for hearing viewers than for the Deaf community.

Children of a Lesser God

Marlee Matlin’s film debut! She signs throughout, and it’s considered a classic - but it’s also a complicated film for the Deaf community.
The story is told from a hearing perspective, and Marlee’s character is often spoken about rather than for, reinforcing the idea that Deaf people need a hearing “bridge.”

It centers on her resisting speech, but the film oversimplifies complex issues around language, identity, and education. Instead of using subtitles, the male lead voices her signs - which limits access and suggests ASL needs to be “translated” to matter.

SuperDeafy

Great movie with a Deaf led cast, including Marlee Matlin! It has lower production quality and fast pacing, which simplifies some things. It’s mostly in ASL and doesn’t always have reliable subtitles, which can hurt accessibility.

It’s a little cheesy at times, but I really enjoyed it - especially the way it shifts from lighthearted to serious. The cast is strong, and it covers real issues in a relatable way.

As another commenter said, they’ve likely already seen many/most films. Maybe a limited series like *This Close* on Sundance? Big deaf cast, co-written by deaf actors. This leaves it open for additional movie nights as well (you mention planning events, plural).

So I can only give you my own experience.

I'm deaf (cochlear implant, can't hear anything without it) and I have a PhD (which I mention only because it seems relevant).

I enjoyed all of the movies you mentioned (actually my daughter and I had quite a good time at A Quiet Place: Day One last year). 

CODA was certainly my family's favorite, but we're able to relate to it: I'm deaf and my kids are hearing.  Given that your target audience is deaf/hoh rather than coda and likely don't have kids yet, I don't know if they'd relate to it as well.

I’m not Deaf or HoH, but I am an interpreter in training! I can’t speak to how scary A Quiet Place would be for your Deaf and HoH attendees, but here are some (maybe) lesser known suggestions:

Unfriended: The Dark Web. 
It doesn’t feature a LOT of ASL, but the main character trying to find workarounds to communicate with his Deaf girlfriend without him having to learn ASL is basically the inciting incident for all of the awful things that go on to happen to him and his friends. It might be interesting to have a conversation about how the main character’s audism has grave consequences for everyone involved.

Also, the movie What? is a solid comedy/homage to the silent film era, about a Deaf actor trying to land a role, and the hijinks that ensue in his attempt to get said role.

Another option might be to show one of the movies HBO has with an interpreter embedded in the corner. I know for sure they have Barbie and the new Beetlejuice for movies, and all of The Last of Us!

1kncypx,deaf,How well can someone with cochlear implants hear like the pitch of someone's voice?,"Hi! I am the transgender son of a mother with cochlear implants, she unfortunately does not believe I am a boy, but I'm an adult now and I just kinda wanted to see if she would notice the gradual change of the pitch of my voice if I went on Testosterone. 

She says she can't hear me too well if I talk in a high pitched voice, so I'm kinda wondering if she would be able to tell if my voice randomly started getting gradually lower. I'm thinking she would but I'm not completely sure! 

Thank you for your time !


[댓글]
There’s no way for us to know how well she can hear with her cochlear. There’s a huge range in people’s abilities to hear with one.

She may notice but if she doesn't believe you then that belief will override her physical notice.

Not a cochlear implant user, but fellow trans person! There will obviously be other physical changes that might be hard to ignore. 

But, as another commenter said: ignorance might override anyway. Don’t worry about it too much if you can, you do you. 

(My parents don’t accept me either and I came out seven years ago. This must be a long ass phase)

I don't have any insight on the hearing part. But I just want to send a lil support your way! 🏳️‍⚧️🫶🏻

Going to depend on the model of CI and the attachment surgery style. It is not uncommon to have difficulty with higher-pitched sounds, regardless.

If you're old enough to go on T without her permission and don't depend on her for survival, I would start T and just see if she notices.

People's voices can change several times as they age without outside hormones. So she may not even notice.

I have one CI and one HA. If I use the CI only there are no nuances to voices. Even though I have very low hearing in my other ear, if I use a hearing aid with CI, I can hear people’s voices and they sound like what I remember they sounded like.

Sending love support and free consensual dad hugs.

I'm a hearing aid user. Everyone's hearing aid different and not all assistive devices are the same. Hearing is a spectrum. I can't speak for CI users or your mother but I think she would notice. There are some people that I hear just fine and then there are some people that I can't hear at all. So there's a chance she will notice a change if it falls within the range that she can pick up easier.

So I’ve only ever heard with my CI as I was born profoundly deaf but I’m an audiologist too and I feel like lower pitch voices are much easier for me to hear compared to higher pitched voices. But also try to have good communication styles with her. Make sure you have her attention prior to talking to her and reword things rather than repeat word for word if she doesn’t understand what she says. I feel like it’s so easy to get frustrated but unless you’re in her position, you truly don’t know what she can and can’t hear. If you can find what her latest audiogram shows for her CI mapping, you can simulate her hearing loss online and it can make you realize how much she may be missing.

CI user here. Have you seen her audiograms with the CI in place? When tested, my hearing levels are all in the normal range. So I can hear all the sounds. Still don't have much speech discrimination because I have sensorineural deafness. (I can discriminate rote phrases in familiar contexts though.) i'm able to hear voices of different pitches. I find low-pitched voices more pleasant to listen to. If your mom's CIs are functioning correctly, she should be able to hear the difference in your voice. My own mom's voice has gotten deeper as she aged and I can tell.

Watch the movie The Sound of Metal. It will help with context.

I hope your mother accepts you for who you are and I hope you don’t need the validation of someone hearing pitch differences in a voice.

i have cochlear implants, and have had since 13 months! i would defo notice!! we can’t know what your mother hears, but for me i hear as low as 20hz so i think she’d be able to tell. despite that, its your life, body, and choice! make that decision if she hears or not!! :)

Most likely she will notice

CI wearer since 2017 here, sending support and loving kindness to you and your mom. I agree with all the posts so far. The best answer I can give is “It depends.” Which doesn’t help much but it’s true. First, I want to be sure you and all readers fully appreciate the difference between CIs and hearing aids. Aids can only amplify sounds. People who have completely lost hearing in the high frequencies will not be able to hear them with hearing aids. 
Cochlear implants convert sounds to digital signals. The implant’s electrode array is inserted in the cochlea where it stimulates the audial nerve. The nerve carries the digital signal to the brain, which has to be trained to translate the signal into a sound we understand. For me it went from all voices sounding like Minnie Mouse to actually sounding human. Then I gradually started to distinguish male from female voices. After that came recognizing individual voices, in person at least. Over the phone I cannot always recognize voices unless they have a unique quality. It two 30-minute training sessions per day for several months, altho since I live alone I only had computer training rather than real voices. That made a difference too. Understanding words and distinguishing pitches is unique to each person, so there are multiple physical individual reasons why someone may or may not hear a difference in pitch. Then there’s the rate at which your voice changes. If it’s gradual it will be hard to notice the difference. Plus all the psychological factors. 
Whether she can hear the difference is not really important. Your faith and confidence in yourself and the joy in your voice as you achieve your true gender is more likely to touch her heart more than the pitch and hopefully come to rejoice with you. I’ll pray for that to happen.",2025-05-15 16:44:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kncypx/how_well_can_someone_with_cochlear_implants_hear/
1knbho4,deaf,Accessibility for a 3 year old,"I’m sorry this might be ramblings of an anxious parent who really just wants what’s best for her child.

My daughter was originally accepted into a total communication program however due to budget cuts the teacher has been let go. So now she will be split between the Deaf and HOH program and the oral program. The caveat is that the oral program has more peers her age but the parents are against having exposure to sign language. 

On paper my daughter my daughter’s strength is in English but for me it’s super important for her to learn ASL.  Her IEP also has a goal for expansion to be able to string together 2-4 signs in a coherent sentence. Me and my husband were thinking in order for her to meet the goal would be to have an interpreter with her during the part when she would be in the oral classroom.

I guess my question is am I overstepping by asking for an interpreter when my daughter is only slightly fluent in ASL? Or in any one has any other ideas on how she can get more exposure in the classroom without canceling out socialization. 

[댓글]
If possible, inquire about a deaf mentor, or teacher, who could come to your home, &amp; provide you with not only support, but sign language instruction &amp; immersion.  Your kiddo’s IEP goals are far more important than some snobby audist / oralist parents forcing THEIR poor kids into an ableist education that will lead to exhaustion &amp; resentment down the road.  Keep signing, &amp; learning together, &amp; giving your kiddo all the tools, &amp; they will eventually figure out which works best for them, &amp; thrive.  🤟🏼

Just to cover some bases, many ""ASL only"" or ""DHH"" programs are not truly ASL only. Almost all do expose children to written English, and if you request speech therapy or audiology services, they can provide that too.

I imagine the other parents would be very upset to find an interpreter is in their child's classroom. Many who place their children in oral programs see ASL as the devil. This might be an uphill battle for you.

And just to put it out there, an oral program does not guarantee socialization skills, and can even make things worse. I learned most of my socialization skills at a school for the deaf, not in my mainstream classes.

This is a bit difficult. 

Let me make sure I'm understanding.

Your daughter is deaf, but learning ASL and her IEP is on the side of ASL over English.

Budget cuts are now placing her in ASL and oral classes. 

Oral classes are against ASL.

Ok, clarification if I got all that correct.

Is the oral class also d/HH? 

Why is that class anti ASL?

I'm not sure an interpreter would be the best at this time only because it doesn't appear she can communicate to a terp yet. 

If she could tell the terp, I want green ball, I'd understand. 

If all she can sign is ""ball"" the terp could only say ""ball"" for her (I'm assuming she hasn't learned NMMs at her age). 

Unlike a teacher who could promote her and guess what she's trying to communicate, the terp, to my understanding and knowledge, is limited. 

I feel once your daughter is more fluent and able to sign clearer her needs/wants an interpreter is absolutely appropriate and not wrong at all (I'd even put it in the IEP she's to have one). 

As for the other parents, sorry.

Their opinions and desires do not cancel your daughter's NEEDS. 

All 3 of my kids know ASL, 2 are fluent and 1 is conversational. 

During school they all had ""ASL time"" and access to an interpreter on request because sometimes they communicated better in ASL opposed to English.",2025-05-15 15:45:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1knbho4/accessibility_for_a_3_year_old/
1knag7s,deaf,I’m hearing and ignorant and I need advice.,"So I’m going to uni next year (UK) and I’ve already met all my future classmates through an offer holder day. This university is really good overall (resources, courses and teaching wise) and very difficult to get into, so those who get an offer are very unlikely to reject it. So everyone at that day was more than likely to be one of my future classmates. 

One of my future classmates is deaf. She uses hearing aids. She doesn’t know much sign language. I offered to sign for her because I know / still use some limited BSL with spoken English grammar due to having communication / speech difficulties (autism and chronic brain fog) and she said she was only just learning. Idk why, I didn’t ask. I was paired up with her for an activity and she’s really nice. I liked that she looked at my mouth and not my eyes, it made doing a one on one activity easier for me. I was very careful when wearing her device (she has one of those things that connects to her hearing aids that you wear around your neck) and made sure to keep facing her / speaking clearly (she asked the teacher to do that so I assume it helps). 

My question is this. How can I be welcoming / helpful / supportive without being weird? I usually don’t have disabled classmates; I’m usually the ‘class disabled kid’ (autism, ADHD, POTS, multiple types of joint issues). I’m not very good with social norms and I don’t want to be offensive or make her life unnecessarily difficult. A lot of people are like that to me. What can I do to make a deaf person feel welcome / comfortable around me? Should I just quit overthinking everything?

[댓글]
She probably will have applied for accommodations at university, such as notetakers, captioning, etc.


The best thing you can do is ask her. She is the one who will know best what makes her life easier.


Something along the lines of ""Hey *name*, if we are paired again, is there anything I can do to support you during classes?"".

One quick note about your disability comment - Deaf and hard of hearing people have different views on whether or not their deafness is a disability. Some would say it is, some not, so in conversations one on one with a deaf person, try to be mindful of that. You can ask if they identify as disabled, and you could get a yes or a no depending on the person. 

I think you’re probably not as ignorant as you might feel that you are - you’re already doing more than a lot of hearing people would do, and you’re already doing your best to accommodate her. 

Since I don’t know this person, it’s hard to give advice that isn’t just recommending you have a conversation with her about what would be best for her. If you’re engaging in conversations with her about her preferences and what works for her, I’d say you’re on the right track.

You've got a good foundation- awareness. Now ask her the same questions directly and don't overthink or overdo it. Behave normally and let her take the lead in telling you how you can help. Most importantly, don't make your interactions just and only about the disability and focus on getting to know her as a classmate and peer.

If you work out how to quit overthinking everything please let the rest of us know 🙃


But also yes, you are overthinking this 💚


I think it's helpful to remember 


1. Treat ppl how they want to be treated 


2. If you haven't had a chance to ask yet treat them like you'd want to be treated.


From what you've described you are already doing fine. Probably the most important thing is treat her like you would any other student, but also keep an eye out for her (like hopefully you would any other student) eg things like making sure she's included in group conversations if it seems like she's struggling to follow the conversation or find a good spot to contribute etc. If you wanna be friends or practice bsl together offer to hang out, make it clear that you are open to her letting you know anything you can do to make communication easier for her, not asking about her medical history /bsl is correct, and probably if you just avoid the things that it annoys you when ppl do to you you'll be fine :)

&gt; How can I be welcoming / helpful supportive

**Ask her**. And fwiw, take ""I don't know"" or ""I'm not sure"" as honest answers and allow for change. Maybe in the future she'll want to use Sign more regularly. Maybe she'll be content with amplification. 🤷 

Much like yourself, she is the one who lives 24/7 as who she is. Has her own preferences, limits, accommodations, etc. The strangers here in this comment section can give you generalities but only she can speak on her experience.

You're already doing what you can. Any more would be weird. Thanks for being an ally 🖤

I have a friend at uni who is deaf, wears hearing aids, and knows no sign language. I don’t think anyone would realize she was deaf if she didn’t make jokes about it all the time. We all just are a little more intentional to look at her when we speak, and sometimes might tap her shoulder if coming from behind, but otherwise…. nothing different or special. but everyone has their own preferences, so be willing to learn, and don’t assume you know better.

Buy an Android phone which will have live captions as an accessibility feature. Check the specs though so you're sure what you're buying has them. I have a Samsung S24 Ultra and I can now do mobile and WhatsApp calls with captions. The feature is not network dependent.

If you stream video and audio files, you can also have captions.

Alternatively, have you tried Relay UK?

Sorry maybe I wasn’t clear. It’s not a mobile that I need it’s a landline (or are they cloud based now??) basically a business phone that connects to the office network for internal and external calls? My friends / family just video call me which is fine but I can’t do that with the office phone.

My problem is solved! Turns out the iPhone can also do captioning as well as the android does. Once activated, it turns all speech to text, so this is anything the phone ‘hears’, calls, videos, WhatsApp and thankfully my work phone system which I answer through an app on my phone. I’d go as far as saying this is life changing for my work situation. It’s been so difficult trying to handle telephone communications for all my working life!

I have these nifty lights on my dashboard that tells me there's a problem.

Sometimes I can feel something is off by the vibrations. I once told my hearing friend something was wrong with her car, and she denied it. Sure enough, the next week, it broke down on the freeway.

Vibrations, dash lights, friends, and a code reader. 

I also do regular maintenance.

Difference in the way it handles, difference in fuel efficiency, maintaining a regular schedule for its upkeep.  I don't think I'm any more or less ignorant to my car's needs than the average driver just because I can't perfectly mimic the exact pitch of ""SKREEEE"" noises it's making to the mechanic.  Frankly, I'm sure they're better for not needing to hear me try.

I have a family member (usually it's my dad or sister #2) or friend who's hearing tell me *something sounds off* about x thing.

Three weeks ago, a light went on my dashboard, so I brought my car in.  Rotors needed to be replaced.  The guy said, “You had to hast squeaking noises, especially from the back ones.” 

Hmm, no, sir, I did not.

Personally, I’ve been an amateur, YouTube certified mechanic for a couple decades. Everything else posted is correct. 

I also have a long screwdriver, where the metal goes through the handle. I can push the screwdriver against my head and the other end on the engine. That’s how I “hear” if fuel injectors are working or if a cylinder is missing for another reason.

I also do it by feel.  I know what my car feels like over roads and various weather conditions.  I tell them something doesn't feel right.  Like when my car started misfiring, I told them car was shaking bad.  I can feel my breaks stuttering, or not responding smoothly before they get bad.

I have one foot feel the road, one foot feel the engine or breaks, and my hand to feel the steering and general car vibration.

Husband or any one of my adult kids if they're the ones standing around. 

There are the lights on the dash, but sometimes those aren't accurate or specific enough. (my tire pressure kept coming up, but my tires were fine. Turns out there was a sensor related to it that was bad- quick and easy fix, but I had no idea). 

My truck is a 2012 Chevy Colorado (midsize pickup). But my husband's 2015 Chevy Silverado (full size truck) has specific lights/signals. If he gets a low tire, it tells him which tire. If something else goes awry, the light is pretty specific.

Ive had to replace brake pads, calipers and disks in the past 5 years, i could feel telltale vibrations and perceive different steering wheel responses under braking easily.

I noticed a worsening difference in fuel economy which turned out to be a malfunctioning O2 sensor.

Not a whole lot needs hearing to notice really.

The only thing i couldn't recognise was a split in the rear exhaust box, however, i knew something was wrong as other drivers and pedestrians would stare at me as i drive past them. 😆

That's utter bullshit. They didn't need to have an interpreter on staff, they can hire an agency or pay for VRS. 


Being on Medicaid shouldn't be a factor either. Except maybe the need for a referral. 


Go back and refuse to take ""no"" for an answer. Get as much in writing as possible. If they say they can't afford it, make them prove it. If they claim undue hardship, get a lawyer, they're required to prove undue hardship.

The thing is, I am genuinely interested in others, in a perfectly quiet environment I'd say my conversation ability is much more elegant, but I'm rarely lucky enough to have conversations in these environments.

When I was younger I really wanted to get into film making, I love practical affects, movies like back to the future do some amazing stuff without relying on the kinds of digital manipulation we have today. 


If I were hearing, I think Foley artist would be a really fun job. But, I'm deaf. Concentrate on your strengths, nobody makes a good movie just by themselves. 


You can also be an advocate for accessibility, even if you have to outsource it to a company like 3play media. You can also explore novel ideas and methods. Most horror movies strongly rely on music to set the tone of the scene. Explore ways to do that without music. 


If you're curious about other deaf film makers look up Charlie Swinbourne. He's a deaf film maker in the UK.

Look up Angry Deaf People Productions. They have some good short films, and I totally cackled over their parody of the Gallaudet and Coke collaboration (I saw it on their Instagram page).

Look up Wayne Betts.

Look on Amazon for ""bone conduction hearing aids.""

In terms of budget, for some people that' s anything under $500! This is an investment, so $100 should not be ruled out. Anything under that.. probably not.

Your best bet is go to your local audiologist/hearing aid place and explain your situation. 

Otherwise look for headphones that give a personalised sound profile, and an adaptor that enables you to use them for telephone/computer work.

1kkhqhm,deaf,Little hearing kids,"It's just a funny story I wanted to share.

Weeks ago a family moved into our neighbourhood. They have two young children, maybe 6 and 8ish, who are often roaming around on their scooters.

Yesterday I had just come home from grocery shopping and they probably noticed my Pokemon shirt and said something to me. And even though I'm in my 30s, I look really young so maybe I looked like a teenager to them.

Now I can't really lip read anything what children say so I tried to explain them I can't hear so they have to speak slow. But all I got to understand was a ""You can't hear?"" which I confirmed. Feeling eventually awkward, I just told then to have a great day and wave at them.

When I was inside putting all my groceries away, my door flashing light went on. I checked outside and nobody was there... except the children far away. I closed the door but hid behind a window and indeed after a while I could see the younger sister pressing the button and hurrying off on their scooter. I believe her intrusive thought of ""if she really can't hear she won't be able to hear it"" won her over. 😭

I don't mind the prank, it's just kids. Although it's sad I can't really communicate with them since I can't understand them. I believe they will be curious every time they see me. I'd like to be able to answer their questions. Maybe someone has an idea?

When my grandgoblin was a little older, we finally explained that Gramsy's ears didn't work the way hers did and she would need to touch my arm if she needed to talk to me. She turned three in the same month I got my hearing aids last year and we explained it to her as it was Gramsy's new ears to help her other ears. So if I did an all-day babysitting with her, I'd announce when I'd take them out, so she would know I wasn't wearing them. 

My daughter told me a few months ago that when she gets fed up with listening to them, she loudly announces she's ""turning off"" her ears and mimes the motions I make when I put mine in their charging case. Then she ignores them for about ten minutes till she forgets she's ignoring them. It makes it funnier to me because she doesn't do that to me. 

Kids, man.

OP please try to make friends with them if you can. My love for asl started at that age all because my mom’s coworkers husband was deaf. I would have to go to work with my mom because we couldn’t afford daycare and whenever Terry was there he’d always engage with me. My mom bought me a Sesame Street asl book so I could learn how to say hi to him. 

40 years later he really made a huge impact on me.

We don't know sign language yet. I want to, but I just don't do well learning from videos for something like this (I've tried) and there aren't any local classes. I'm still hoping to figure something out. Suggestions would be great. 

With my older kids I always have had a great relationship and have been able to talk to them easily. Two of them I have some trouble hearing, but nothing like this kiddo. I've got good hearing aids and she tries to talk louder and enunciate clearer, but it's just impossible to have a conversation with her unless someone else is there and can tell me what she's saying. I would love to know if any of you have found some solution to a situation like this given that we don't know sign language yet and even if we started right now, it would be some time before we could converse.

Can you use the app to change the bass or treble settings? I have a bell curve of hearing loss and that sometimes helps. I get you though, I just can’t understand certain voices.

I started to seriously investigate a cochlear implant when I stopped being able to understand my kids.

There's not a lot of situations where I'd suggest this, but you might look into [Cued Speech](https://cuedspeech.org/learn/start-cueing/) as you and your family continues to learn ASL.  Cued Speech can typically be learned over the course of a weekend, and it relies on a very simple set of finger placements to visually distinguish various phonemes.

There's an on-demand self-study course available for $49 you can access [right here](https://cuecollege.org/new-courses-learn-to-cue/), and charts on the previous page I linked as well.

I don't know how to cue myself, but a few Deaf friends with hearing parents grew up with it before transitioning to ASL.  It's nothing anyone should be recommending to parents of Deaf kiddos or considering a substitute for an actual *language* like ASL, but it was developed at Gallaudet and in your specific situation having your family learn it might be quick, cost-effective, and reduce frustration.

Transcription apps are only as good as the microphone and setting.

Have you looked for classes at your local college/university? You could audit a class or see if they have an ASL club

My teens and I often have conversations over snapchat.

My sister also profoundly deaf, hearing with aids. She cannot hear high voices, shouting. Since your daughter is quite young, her voice may be a little (naturally) high due to her age. Would it help if she talked to you in a lower voice? I have live listen on my phone with text, I’m assuming this is what you mean by live transcribe?

1kkfpzv,deaf,I made it this far but question the future.,"Hello deaf community, I just joined the group with so many questions. I am a 58 y/o male in the US who has been losing my hearing since birth. I retired three years ago at age 55 with 30 years of service and a pension. It was too difficult to continue my career without hearing in meetings and conversations, so I decided to get out while I was on top. Throughout my career as a marketing professional I felt limited because of my hearing. I often had to avoid meetings and presentations which resulted in missed opportunities for personal development.

I have almost no hearing in my left ear (non repairable) and a profound loss in my right ear. Currently use one hearing aid from Costco which is a  Jabra GN Enhance Pro with a super strong amplifier in the ear. The left ear is too deaf to use a hearing aid. I have never had more than one hearing aid at a time even though I had only severe loss in both ears until my late teens. The cost of two aids was too much for my family and I was doing okay with the one hearing aid.

My last visit to a hearing doctor was about 10-12 years ago. At that time, he told me I was not a candidate for a cochlear implant because I was getting by with one hearing aid and the quality of sound from the cochlear implant was not going to be suitable for me. I don’t know whether that has changed over the years, but it is something I would be willing to try.

Today, I can hear fairly well due to the technological advances of my hearing aid. However, I still miss about 75-90% of conversations when in social environments such as restaurants and parties. It is very frustrating. I am thinking that I should start to learn sign language. 

I look forward to participating in this group.

Definitely learn sign language. 

And suggest another ENT and audiologist check up. Even as you expect to lose more hearing, if it's been 12 years, a lot has changed. And you can ensure your hearing aid is better tuned to your latest test results.

Learn Sign Language! Not only will it help in communication but learning a new language helps keep your brain sharp and introduces you to a new culture and allows you to meet many interesting people. 

Never let hearing loss leave you isolated and lonely. Speak up for yourself and your needs! Self-advocate. Be bold.

Welcome to our community. Which part of US do you reside in?

Does your hearing aid have Bluetooth or the kind that can hook up to an FM system/microphone? That way you can give the microphone to your boss, co-workers, etc so you can hear them better

I’m not a professional audiologist or ENT. Not profoundly deaf either. I am moderate (right ear) to severe (left) loss. I did not grow up with hearing aids. Did not grow up in Deaf community, am now, age 60, exploring my deafness. Beginning to learn ASL. So take what I write with a grain of salt. I highly recommend a visit to an ENT/audiologist, FIRST! He/she will offer paths to better hearing &amp; communication: better prescription hearing aids, perhaps a cochlear implant. You could take ASL and/or speech reading classes. You will have options. It’s your life, your hearing! Do what you believe is best for YOU!

My daughter (15) is on her 3rd CI. I never pushed them, and she was raised culturally Deaf. She was born with profound sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally. They never worked until March. She is definitely getting imput. I will never say she's hearing, but the other day, she caught that the water was left on and tubilateral. She can tell when music starts and stops...and that it's music. She can't understand language and maybe never will, but I feel a lot better about her riding her bike to track.

Do you know many Deaf folks?


If the answer is no / only a few then I'd suggest seeking one within a position of authority. Someone who reccomendation letters are part of the job.


Something like a boss, manager, banker, professor, lecturer, teacher (not your own). Explain to them your situation and ask them for their advice.


It seems like a bit of a strange requirement... I guess its meant as a bit of a filter. Are you sure there aren't more entry level interpreter degrees?

I'm not deaf, but have one very universal tip when asking for favours: ALWAYS offer up a polite ""out"", as part of your request.


For example:


""I need a personal reference. I value your credibility in the community, and feel like your contribution would be very helpful to my application. Let me know if this is something you'd feel comfortable doing. *I understand if you're short on time, so no hard feelings if you're unable to. Just let me know either way.*""


I'll let other people speak to the Deaf community ethics and sensibilities part of it, obviously.

I am Deaf, and once I met a hearing ASL student who did a specific type of work that I happened to need in my house. So I hired him with the expectation of paying for his services, but he declined and instead asked me for a letter of recommendation. I was happy to write it.

Have you done any volunteering at local Deaf organizations or churches? That would be a good place to ask.

From everything you’ve said so far, I think you really need to start becoming involved as much as you can. Say yes to every event, volunteer opportunity, and anything else that comes your way. People really can’t make a recommendation on someone they have met once and maybe talked to for a couple minutes. You should be doing what you can to develop real, legitimate connections, not only will it hugely impact your signing skills, but it will also mean there are people you can comfortable ask who actually know your signing skills. I suspect part of the letter of recommendation is not only vouch for your skills, but also you as a person. Things like trustworthiness, reliability, respect for Deaf culture, etc.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Sorry but I think your instincts are right here that you don't know anyone well enough to ask yet, and you should become actually involved in your Deaf community enough that you regularly interact with Deaf people enough that this would be an appropriate thing to ask before considering doing an interpreting course. I know it's hard around studying, but this is part of studying sign, and especially important if you are studying interpreting because this is your opportunity to do so, as depending on what kind of interpreting you end up doing you might want to have a little more distance once you working to keep professional boundaries.


As to how to tell someone straight away without feeling like you are using them, don't do it just for the recommendation letter, do it bc you should have been doing this the whole time. I think your best bet is to find a work or volunteer opportunity that you can do regularly and build relationships that way. In that context it might be okay to mention that you'll need a letter of recommendation eventually, but ideally still wait til the person knows you better to ask",2025-05-11 17:35:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kk6j7x/how_would_you_like_a_hearing_person_to_approach/

I find this incredibly useful for myself, as someone who struggles with short-term memory when it comes to auditory things. Cause of that, i process things more visually, so having something for me to actually SEE what the multi-part order is (especially not having worked at a cafe before) has been amazing.

Of course this is nothing new, about workplaces that can easily be more accessible but they choose not to for ~reasons~, but I just wanted to say *kiss fist* and thank you for making my new job a little less nerve-wracking.

How about instead you try to amplify other deaf artists? I’m a deaf artist and I know I would appreciate that.

No. Replace deaf with any marginalized group and ask yourself if it's ok.

Not really. There are plenty of Deaf artists already making Deaf art.

It’s good that you’re asking, but I’m not sure that there is. What did you have in mind?

Work with deaf artists or students. Local muralists or artists have partnered with my Deaf school’s high school art students to create some art on campus or in the city. The opportunities gave them a public platform and taught them some art stuff. It’s really cool.

Are you being purposefully vague here?

Absolutely not. Artists make art about their experiences and what they know. As a hearing person you do not know Deaf experiences.

Potentially, yes. But will you actually do it that way as someone who is not part of the Deaf community? 99.999999999% chance no.

And it wouldn’t really be at all about the Deaf community if you did it. It would be about you rather than about us.

But you’d probably try to use our visual vocabulary (whether that’s ASL or De’Via or something else along those lines) and that would likely be appropriating.

Most hearing people doing this are way too tempted by Deaf culture. Can you do art about us without appropriating? It’s potentially possible…. and, yet, so unlikely you or the vast majority of hearing people will. You cannot appropriate being Deaf or abandon having the artistic voice of a hearing person to do it. You also can’t “talk” over us using your art. You need to be fully aware of your potential impact on the community and care and not dismiss it, and be willing to put the community before what you want to do.

Most hearing people don’t have the cultural literacy to actually pull this off. Honestly, most get hung up at having empathy for someone other than their own hearing fragile ego. The rarely of someone pulling this off doesn’t mean take this as a challenge to be the super special hearing person that does (that person usually has the least potential to get it right).

Also, *why us?*

I ask because usually this is linked with exoticism.

I would like to see a series where a hearing person actually confronts shit like that in themselves in an unflinching way.

But most hearing doing this, regardless of whatever they think they intend, just want to be in effect another colonizer with appropriative ASL art and want a promise we won’t call them a colonizer so they don’t have to feel like one.

I think the other honest way for hearing to do Deaf art is to work for a Deaf artists who needs an affordable assistant and do their art according to their specifications and give them the credit, and then when you’re on your own, do your own work that isn’t related to the Deaf community…. Also, not appealing to most hearies. Most artists in generally really, save students who are just generally curious purely for learning sake, those on a chronic shortage of ideas who want to keep their hands busy, the technical sorts who could do their own work but would rather be restoring something, etc…. the sorts of artists who are a bit of oddballs even among artists.

I think the queston ir to broad to say yes or no.

If what you are creating. Is actually Deaf art ar a dirivative of that, then you probably won't get much support &amp; will probably encounter friction if your art gets exposure. If, however, it is simply your art, but you were inspired by the use of colors or some other non-deaf specific design, than you're probably fine, people get inspiration from any number of places.

Can you add a bit more &amp; tell us specifically what you are inspired by &amp; how you'd plan to use it in your artwork?

1kjihee,deaf,Etiquette for correcting ASL interpreters on name spelling,"Hi, hopefully this is an OK place to ask this question. I am hearing but interact with Deaf colleagues and community members semi-frequently through interpreters. I am transmasculine but generally most people who see me assume I am a woman and that I spell my name as Brooke rather than Brook, which can make me feel more dysphoric than your average name misspelling might. So I’m wondering what the etiquette is when interpreters misspell my name. I can read fingerspelling but typically can’t do it smoothly myself (due to joint and motor control issues). 

When interpreters spell my name B-R-O-O-K-E, what is the best way to correct them? I know you aren’t supposed 
to address the interpreter, just the Deaf person, but I did once try saying as an aside to the interpreter “Oh, it’s actually spelled without an E” but then she had to interpret what I had said, which made sense but… it was a bit  awkward. Any better suggestions for how to handle it?  Or am I just overthinking this and should just continue with interrupting the conversation to say ""it's spelled without the E"" to the interpreter?

[댓글]
“Hi my name is Brook, spelled B-R-O-O-K”

Just do what you were doing - don’t worry about it.

[deleted]

If this is a constant, you need to tell the interpreter. 

Their job is to sign what you say, meaning if you include ""spelled B-R-O-O-K"" they'll tell everyone the correct spelling. 

You mentioned you look like a woman, so there's a chance spelling errors may still occur if people know the feminine version is spelled with an ""E,"" but it'd say it's the first step. 

Personally I didn't know there was a difference in how men and women spell Brook(e) or that Brook was even a male name (not surprised exactly, just never seen this). 

My cousin is Brooks, which I thought was the male equivalent of Brooke.

&gt; I did once try saying as an aside to the interpreter “Oh, it’s actually spelled without an E” but then she had to interpret what I had said, which made sense but… it was a bit  awkward. 

This is absolutely fine. Please don’t think it was awkward - the deaf person also needs to know it’s spelled without an e.  

Yes you could have also said it direct to the deaf person and that might be slightly better, but here you’re politely &amp; gently clarifying an interpreting mistake. It’s OK whichever way you choose.

f you're able to tell the interpreter ahead of time, that's the best option because it stops them from misspelling/misgendering before it can happen

If you don't get to talk to the interpreter ahead of time, correcting in the moment is perfectly fine too.

As an interpreter, correct my spelling. I usually pick a spelling of every name I hear that is spelled phonetically enough and wait to be told my guess was wrong, and I don’t feel offended if you say actually that’s spelled B-R-O-O-K",2025-05-10 19:40:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kjihee/etiquette_for_correcting_asl_interpreters_on_name/
1kjd5uz,deaf,How do you navigate going through TSA at the airport as a deafie?,"A couple days ago I flew to my parents and it was a mess. TSA seemed convinced that my hearing aids were earbuds (bte, they look nothing like earbuds) and made me take them off several times. I kept trying to explain that I am deaf and can't understand what they're saying but I have a very quiet voice that I have trouble raising since I can't really hear it. I guess they couldn't hear me. I pointed to my ears, did the whole deaf gesture and everything and they wouldn't let up. Even when they had my hearing aids off they kept barking orders in my face that I couldn't understand. I got sent for extra inspection after being made to take them off a third time.
 The metal detector sucked too, because you have to stand facing the wall, I can't see anyone to wave me on. They just yell at me until they realize I can't hear and start aggressively waving their hands in my face. 

I'm flying back home today and absolutely dreading it. I am traveling alone so I have no one to help me explain or tell me when to go. I just feel my gut wrenching from the thought of going through TSA again this evening. 

So I'm wondering if any of you have any tips that have eased the stress for you and made things go smoothly?

[댓글]
Am regular flyer, completely deaf, I don’t even wear hearing aids. Have flown many places around the world including in the US and have never had an experience like yours. 

I’m sorry you had a dreadful time, it shouldn’t ever be like this. All airport security should be able to liaise with people who don’t even speak English. Part of the job. They should be able to communicate through gestures, and 90% of the time this is how it’s gone with me. The other 10% have struggled a bit but again never had any issues like yours. 

May I suggest next time you go through airport security, don’t use your voice at all?

Communication in formal situations like TSA is about quickly establishing parameters and honesty in communications.  Hearing people often think **if you can speak, that means you can hear**. Then they think you are *lying to them* because when you speak, you’re now saying you can’t hear them. Things go downhill from here. 

Best to start the interaction by making it clear through gesture you are completely deaf with no speech (even if that’s not strictly true). That’s simple and easy for a hearing person to understand. It calibrates their expectations. It  makes it clear to them you are doing your best to communicate and be helpful.

Something all these speech therapists never mention. Because they’re hearing and obsessed with making you the same as them. They have no idea what it’s actually like to live as a deaf person and they don’t know the non-verbal skills &amp; tactics we use to succeed.

I've been traveling for years and never had these problems.  You need to report them.  This is not normal. (And I don't voice anything)

You can get a ticket that states that you’re Deaf. Hold it and point to it when they’re trying to talk to you ( might need to go to the gate agent instead of the terminals or using your phone).

Call em up and report to tsa

That sounds like a specific experience with specific TSA employee issues. I fly a lot I’ll tell the person checking my ID in case they have questions and I’ll mention it at the metal detector but your hearing aids will only set off the hand wand not the walk through things. I’ve not had any issues and even met a few TSA employees who also wear hearing aids.

I had a customer at work tell me once, that I could probably hear better if I took my headphones out.. me and my ""deaf"" sticker on my badge just stared at her. 
They just don't get it.  Especially if you can speak.

I completely understand, I've been told that I'm profoundly hard of hearing. Without my heaing aids I can't hear much at all. Its frustrating.

You should get some of those  lanyards with the yellow sunflowers on them.  Wear that around your neck, and have some pre printed cards indicating you're Deaf, and that they can use text on their phone to ""speak"" to you.

The lanyard indicates a hidden disability - show it to the people at the boarding gate too, and they may bring you on early for preboarding before everyone else gets on the plane.  I've had that service on past flights.

Most airports, and some bus transport companies are aware of the sunflower lanyards and their purpose.

You can also have a text app on your phone, where you can type out your questions (or your pizza order ?  things like that)  I use Big Note app on Android,  because I can make the text bigger or smaller so people can read what I typed out.

Wiki re: [Sunflower Lanyards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Disabilities_Sunflower)

Seconding people who said voice off in those circumstances; 100%!!! 

They don’t understand or fail to remember deafness is a spectrum, so if they feel you are “talking” therefore you will understand them regardless. 

I’m a frequent flier worldwide; from Europe as my base growing up and now fly from east coast, and never experienced what you experienced. I never used my voice in any airports, I make them WORK to accommodate me. 

Do you know the number of people on volunme they see and try to pass through daily? Certainly lots of non English speakers, disabled fliers; hidden or visible, and deaf people. What you can do is if you’re comfortable at check in, ask for accommodations through security and gate to your plane? It can be comforting to have that until you get a handle on those situations as you fly more often and get into code switching yourself. I’m sorry you had horrible experience and hopefully this is the only and last experience.

There's something called a sunflower lanyard, you can get it at any help information desk. Upon wearing it you're letting others know you have a hidden disability. But also that's screwed up they asked you to take it off. You have rights not to

Does your boarding pass indicate you’re Deaf?   In future make sure it’s there and point to it.

Airports are one of the few places I’ll wear a pin that says deaf. It’s small and I have to point it out, but it does help.

I’ve flown hundreds of times and have never had any hearing related issues with TSA, nor with my BTE setting off the alarm. I also really don’t understand how you had a metal detector facing a wall?

Were you in some tiny podunk airport?

I’m going to guess two things:
- You will not run in to any of these issues on the return flight. Completely different airport, completely different staff.
- You will probably (hopefully) never run into this kind of trouble again. It’s such an out of the norm thing. You should maybe consider buying some lottery tickets, since you’re able to have one-in-a-million experiences.

My first post on Reddit. I signed up just now because I have to respond to this. I had a horrible time in security at the HNL airport. A woman in security picked up my backpack said something to me and I replied that I was hard of hearing and couldn't understand her with all the background noise. She got angry, said something else, and took my backpack away around a corner to the side. I waited for a few seconds and another security guy came up behind me grabbed my shoulder pointed and said something and shoved me in that direction. I kept it very cool because I know you can't react to rude security people at an airport. I went around the corner and she was barking at me and opened my backpack and took things out one by one. She made a point of looking at each thing with unnecessary expressions like rolling her eyes and dropping them on the counter  instead of placing them down. This included my new laptop. There was no reason to pick it up and drop it onto the hard counter. Then she put everything back in my backpack held it out and dropped it again while immediately turning and walking away without another word. It was like she was purposely trying to break something to punish me for being difficult. I was speechless. I have traveled all around the world including lots of airports in the US and had never had anyone act like that. I have a card now with ""hard of hearing"" printed on it that I carry with me whenever going through airport security.

i always request an escort through security! they will try to bring you a wheelchair though 😂

I agree with not using your voice, and maybe even putting your hearing aids into your bag. It goes much better. 

[TSA.gov](http://TSA.gov) has instructions that you do not need to take out your hearing aids. You may want to have this page printed out and ready to show them if they ask again.

Don’t use your voice and type into your phone notes “I’m deaf” and show it their faces

You can get [travel support](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/tsa-cares/passenger-support).

I’ve flown more times than I can count. Never have taken my hearing aids out in security. That’s weird, do they light up on the screen?

My issue is my crotch always lights up on the screen. No clue why. I always get the special pat down. 🙄

Sorry you experienced that. Traveling is stressful enough. I wear an enamel pin I got made off Etsy that says Hard of Hearing. TSA and flight attendants spot it and are always kinder to me. I even got upgraded once and I think it was because of the pin.

I have never ever had to take my BTE hearing aids off—that is very weird.

If approached, I sign Deaf and don't speak regardless. I look confused. I start signing, and they leave me alone. For some reason, hearing people associate talking with hearing. So, I don't talk. And let me guess: Was it Atlanta or Dallas?

The TSA cares site allows you to print off a card that you can hand to TSA. I go voice off and hand a card to everyone who is TSA. [https://www.tsa.gov/contact-center/form/cares](https://www.tsa.gov/contact-center/form/cares)

If it happens again, I’d get pissed… take out your HAs, blasting with feedback, hold them right in front of their face, &amp; say loudly, “THESE ARE HEARING AIDS, BECAUSE I’M DEAF, you daft twat!”  And sign, too, obviously.  Make them feel dumb &amp; embarrassed as f-ck.

Look for the Sunflower 🌻

Yea I wear hearing aid on the right ear. I am deaf and legally blind with my cane in the past in 1997 with my SSP. TSA passed me just fine and no problem, white cane placed on the belt roller for x-ray screening before catch the airport shuttle bus to the twin propellers chartered plane (30 Deafblind souls on the charter plane).

I wore a T-shirt with a hearing aid that said “I’m wearing a wire”. It got the point across 😬

Been through several countries including China and the US with ITE hearing aids and never had an issue.... there's something wrong with that airport!

If you have the energy for it, maybe pursue through the US version of equal opportunity (if DOGE hasn't gutted it yet) or even complain to the airport. They'll have the incident recorded on camera.

I have a button that says I’m hearing impaired. After the mistake of walking around the airport the first time with the pin, I figured out how to make it compliant by removing the sharp pin and instead using a magnetic backer (also helps protect my shirts from being ruined by holes from the safety pins). 

As for my HAs I have a disability card I show to TSA agents that verify my HAs are needed for me to comply with them, and they either let me keep them in because they can discriminate on the X-Ray, or they try to help me understand what they say as they toss the HAs in the tray. Sometimes you’ll encounter the asshole who gets off on treating everybody like crap but if it wasn’t your hearing impairment, they’d find another reason to make you feel small.

Sorry you went through all that and sorry I didn't get to you before your flight. Just dropped into this sub because I had an experience with a deaf person at the airport and then I saw this thread. Hopefully this helps you next time or just in general.

The single best piece of advice I can give you is using text to communicate your issues. In the past I have had full blown drunk conversations with deaf people writing whatever we needed to communicate on our phone and showing it to each other. Get the persons attention and show them the message. If they dismiss you, simply write as large as you can ""I AM DEAF"" and at that point it should click for them. If an employee dismisses you after that get the attention of another employee and do the same thing. Don't act frustrated even though you are because then their brains go into a whole different mode, they deal with frustrated people a lot and at that point it's just following their taught procedure. At that point they aren't hearing to your concerns any more than you are to them, lol. HOPEFULLY it never comes down to that situation because after that the only other advice is rinse and repeat until you find a TSA with half a brain, which honestly good luck. 

I would possibly submit a complaint with the ADA. Accommodations should have been made for you. Airports generally have people there to assist deaf people, it's just TSA don't know anything about them. Honestly, I don't even know how to get in touch with them. I'm going to ask around next week and see if I can't figure it out.

Lemme guess, American airport right?

There’s some great advice here, another suggestion to top it all off is to consider getting a sunflower lanyard.

Not all airports and places recognize them but majority of the largest ones do - even in the US. 

It signals to employees you might need extra time or special accommodation, but it also gives you a way to clearly and directly communicate with someone without constantly writing or gesturing. 

Also most airports who recognize it give their employees proper training and more information than those who don’t.

Sunflower lanyard, take the special disability lane if they have one, tell the airline so your boarding pass has the right code, if it's an especially shitty airport or you especially anxious about it accept their disability Escort service (yes there is every chance they will try give you a wheelchair if you do this, up to you if you want to argue or just go with it 🙃)",2025-05-10 15:40:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kjd5uz/how_do_you_navigate_going_through_tsa_at_the/
1kjd4fu,deaf,Swallowed HA mold,"So there's a possibility my 19 month old swallowed the mold from one of his HA. And of course it's the brand new pair we just got yesterday and they take four weeks to get.

Anyone ever dealt with this? I guess we hope to find it in his poo?

Update: crisis averted, not sure where it was since we looked everywhere  but he threw it at us about 30 minutes later. When you find your kid chewing on a piece of the tube with no mold in sight though, it's easy to jump to worst case scenario.

For clarity yes we contacted the pediatrician as well, however we were waiting on a callback and a bit freaked out so figured we'd ask here in the meantime.

This is a *talk to the doctor* situation.

None of us here should be considered experts in how safe / dangerous this will be. Even if anybody here is literally a doctor - we are not your doctor and are not examining your child.

I will leave this post up for now as someone else might have advice - but I strongly implore you to take anything you see with a grain of salt and get in contact with a doctor ASAP (whether via an emergency or non-emergency line).

That is what I would do. Also maybe call the pediatrician just to make sure they agree.

Don't have any advice. I just want to say I hope you guys find it in the poo because holy shit kid man....  I thought they were trouble because they got sick all the time from the other kids at school and learn how to trash talk you, that never ends. 

Search around their toys. If it's safe though, when you find it put something reflective like a sticker on it. That way it's easier to find with a flashlight.

Make absolutely sure they did not swallow the button battery! They are deadly and can cause death within hours! If there's any possibility they swallowed the battery, you need to go to the ER, now.

My question is, how does a 1 y/o pry an earmould off, &amp; swallow it, let alone none of the other major parts??  Did you just find an abandoned HA on the floor, feedbacking like hell, &amp; the earmould gone??

1. Like everyone else said, this is a pediatrician situation. They're probably gonna want to do an x-ray at minimum.  
2. Someone go get *The Girl with the List*, because holy hell.

Thanks everyone. Turns out he walked into the room and chucked it at us half an hour later. Pediatrician had already said by that point he wasn't concerned as he'd likely poo it out if it had been swallowed but we were waiting on a call back when I posted this so figured I'd ask if any other parents had the same experience.

The battery door is tamperproof so he can't get to the batteries, fortunately, but the tubing and the ear molds apparently feel great on little gums and end up in the mouth far more often than we would like.",2025-05-10 15:38:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kjd4fu/swallowed_ha_mold/

I meet with friends (deaf) at least 3 times a month and mix of Deaf and hearing 2 times a month (the hearing are learning ASL).

It will be nice to have a place for Deaf online to communicate and express ourselves freely in environment where hearies aren't going to insert hearing perspectives.

I feel this. I'm a deaf drummer and bouncer who has worked in my local live music industry for twenty years and no matter how strong my reputation is, I will never have to stop proving myself at any venue that hires me, even on the strength of my reputation and solid references. Nobody believes a deaf person can do what we do until we prove it... but the benefit of the doubt would be nice sometimes.

I’m with you on this, I’ve always loved playing music, but I lost most of my interest because of these things. 

Even these small interactions of people either doubting your abilities or your deafness is so disheartening. 
It’s so difficult to be seen as your deafness instead of a person. 

I’m tired of people seeing deafness in such black and white, negative terms - but I have found people who truly value my skills and support me without focusing on my deafness as a flaw.

Keep playing, regardless if it’s for yourself or to prove them wrong.

Your English is great and people are foolish. Some people just can't get past ""Deaf means zero hearing ever"" even when shown evidence to contrary

This is a bit off topic but you might check out DPANVIDEOS on YouTube.  There are many deaf musicians.

I'm a hearing musician and I played in a band with a singer who is deaf (more hard of hearing, but he refers to himself as deaf). Nobody would have any clue if he didn't tell them that he has a limited range in what he can hear. He also produces music.

I’m HoH Bassoonist and have been trying to make it in the classical world. I’ve stopped mentioning to people I’m HoH cause I’ve noticed it truly doesn’t change anything. My problem is never playing in the ensemble but directors yell out rehearsal letters and so many letters sound the same I never know where we are starting. Most directors already expect the ensemble to read their minds half the time so asking for a slight accommodation was like asking for their first born child. Shout out to Dr. Talley at LSU though I never asked him if he had experience working with HoH musicians but he would say the rehearsal letter and a composer that started with that letter. A bit silly but I was never confused on where were starting cause “B for Bach” and “D for Dorvak” makes it so clear and only took an extra second.

I've had to explain to people that it's very common for deaf musicians to still have a typical audio profile only ""softer"", you're only losing loudness, not the actual note. (and ""in tune"" has a reverberation feeling in the sinuses!)

1kioifp,deaf,AI interpretation developed with Deaf developers and input,"I posted this in r/asl and it was suggested I also post here. I’m not trying to make any judgments about the use of AI in general, just thought it was intriguing. 

I think the signing video shown in this article must have been generated via the app, using an AI avatar. If so, it’s a lot better than I would have expected.

[댓글]
Personally, i can see where hearing people are gonna lean way too heavy on this kind of stuff and not the expertise of interpreters to effectively ensure that the communication is being passed correctly for the Deaf individuals. Case in point, it’ll be hard to determine if the ai is correctly signing regional signs if ai cannot receive input from Deaf person asking for clarification or meaning of a certain sign being used.  My best analogy of how this is being approached as if someone is putting on shoes of a person who has mobility barriers and uses a wheelchair to travel, yes the shoe has everything that a person would consider what a shoe is for but if I’m a wheelchair user, I’ll wear the shoe but it’s probably not gonna be used for walking as much as the shoe barer would hope happen.

interesting. the output is really clear. a little bit... _too clear_. i think this was made with the help of an interpreter... for example the way he pauses isn't necessary, but interpreters do it to think. an AI model can see the entire document at once, it doesn't need to think like that.

It’s better than I expected but this is a terrible idea. Hearing people have no idea the effectiveness of an interpreter (the illusion of accessibility) and how will the deaf person communicate back? The finger spelling is god awful, and it should be on a black background. Wouldn’t it just be cheaper to pay a handful of interpreters to record short videos? AI is a plague.

Though everyone is different.  You're going to get info from the doctor about general care after the surgery.  No heavy lifting, stuff like that, for about 2-3 weeks. It's not all that different from anything else.  One thing to consider is that if he relies on the residual hearing in that ear he needs to expect that he'll lose it in the process of getting a CI.  I didn't lose my residual hearing but I barely had any let to lose anyway.

r/cochlearimplants

When I got mine my own head felt like a dead weight. It was so heavy for a few days and whenever I needed to go to the bathroom I had to really focus to not fall over. I was dizzy and kept walking into things, so if that's how it'll go with your boyfriend just be there and offer stability if he needs it. He might be fine balance wise, but holding onto someone stopped me loosing my balance for those first few days

Dude!  How many are you going to bother!??

I wouldn't worry too much, it's a very minor surgery. The biggest problem was that I'm a side-sleeper so it was hard to not sleep on that side for a while.

They give you ages worth of pain meds, but they're way overkill for how minor the surgery is; he likely won't need anything after 2-4 days, if he even needs them. Personally, I found OTC tylenol to be fine. 

The anesthesia can also make stomach feel off for a day or so, so easy foods like crackers and broth for the first 1-2 days.

And just as a note, he should stick to r/ochlearimplants for any questions. This sub doesn't have the best opinions about CI's.",2025-05-09 16:35:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kimxs2/cochlear_implant_surgery/
1kij13u,deaf,Call for Deaf Artists - Mural Festival :),"Hi!     

My name is Kate - I am an artist and a coda. Myself and my family are starting a new mural festival in Colorado which is **specifically for artists who are members of the deaf community.** We just released our call for artists application and I wanted to share it here. 

A little background: I've participated in a few mural festivals and found them to be so fun, but pretty lacking in access overall. And overwhelmingly made up of hearing artists. So we wanted to create a new mural festival centered on the deaf community.  

This is a paid art opportunity! Previous mural experience is not a requirement. We are looking for artists with a developed personal style and dedicated art practice. 

Our application is here: [Artist Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9IQE6eVtZRAAtM8bO1b599JHIjdxmAIxp0b7HjWbvssKfaw/viewform?pli=1)

And our website with more information is here:  [https://www.kissfistmuralfest.com/](https://www.kissfistmuralfest.com/) 

Please let me know if you have any questions at all. We are accepting applications until June 15th! 

[댓글]
Do you have any art from previous mural festivals?

As a fellow artist/coda this looks amazing!  Good luck with it!

commenting to bump this as a reminder if anyone wanted to apply as our deadline is in a week! Feel free to DM me if you have any questions or ask them here!",2025-05-09 13:52:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kij13u/call_for_deaf_artists_mural_festival/
1ki6frg,deaf,"Coca-Cola now has a new sign name—“Cooo-Keee!” (No, seriously.)","Hi, r/deaf! Helen here. 

Today, Gallaudet University released two videos in collaboration with Coca-Cola on their social media platforms.

(links at the bottom of this post) 

#Coke/Gallaudet Video Campaign

The main video, titled “We Want to Teach the World to Sign,” is a reimagining of Coca-Cola’s iconic 1971 ad, “I’d Like to Buy the World a Coke.”
 
[Watch the Coke/Gallaudet video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUCtzkKUwSo)

[Original 1971 Coke ad for comparison.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VM2eLhvsSM&amp;t=1s)

The original ad is considered one of the most famous commercials of all time. It featured a multicultural group of people standing on a hilltop outside Rome, singing ""I'd like to buy the world a coke"" in harmony. 

From what I gathered in a quick Google search, it was such a cultural phenomenon that the jingle was adapted into a full-length song, “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony),” which went on to chart in Billboard’s Top 10.

Now, Coca-Cola seems to be doing a ""clever"" twist on that idea—replacing “sing” with “sign.”

In the Gallaudet version, deaf performers introduce a new sign name for “Coke.” It’s fingerspelled as “Co-Ke,” with both parts moving in a wave-like motion that mirrors the flowing ribbon in Coca-Cola’s iconic logo. Visually, it reads kind of like “Cooo-Keee.”

The ad ends with a message from Coca-Cola:

&gt;“Thank you to Gallaudet University for giving us our sign name. Love, Coca-Cola.”

#Behind the Scenes

The [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRbFdUrPxQ8) features two students, Natasha Richards-Hamilton and Zanibelle Hoglind, explaining the collaboration behind the campaign. They shared that the creation of the new name sign was a joint effort between Coca-Cola and Gallaudet University that involved “eight months of linguistic research, international community feedback, surveys, and real collaboration with Coca-Cola’s team.”

The project was led by deaf students at Gallaudet under the guidance of Storm Smith, university communication's Storytelling Director. It was part of a broader effort by University Communications to help global brands engage with the deaf community in ways that are authentic, inclusive, and community-driven.

In light of the recent troubling news from Gallaudet, (the layoffs and the program enrollment suspensions) I’ve got to tip my hat off to the University for pulling off a successful, high-profile collaboration like this with Coca-Cola. It’s a strong reminder of what deaf-led creativity and leadership can achieve, even during uncertain times.

#Thoughts?

I always welcome major media efforts that spotlight the deaf community. They’re good for all of us. They spread awareness, normalize our presence, and help bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing people.

Representation in mainstream media and pop culture has been steadily increasing over the past 10–15 years, and I see that as a very good thing. Every time I meet a new hearing person, I often get comments like:

&gt;“Hey, I saw CODA the other day and learned a lot about the deaf community! Are you part of that world?”

&gt;“There’s a new Marvel show on Disney Plus called Echo. She’s a badass! And I learned so much about ASL!”

That’s why I view campaigns like this Coke/Gallaudet one as beneficial. They spark curiosity and lead to more informed conversations with hearing people.

And this isn’t just any campaign. It’s a Coca-Cola campaign! And it's a recreation of the most famous commercial of all time in ASL. 

So far, the Instagram post featuring the ad seems to be getting a very warm reception.

And yet…

Here’s the chatter from my circle of deaf friends about the new name sign:

&gt;“…that’s it?”

&gt;“The new name sign for Coke is just fingerspelling Coke!?”

&gt;“The new name sign is… Cooo-Keee!?”

&gt;“They spent eight months researching that?”

&gt;“Fingerspelling ‘Coke’ works fine for me. I’m not switching to ‘Cooo-Keee.’”

But they generally think it's a good video campaign. 

So… what are your thoughts? Will you use the new name sign? Do you think this campaign will make an impact on our community?

My honest first reaction?: It kinda has ""Gallaudet is broke and for sale"" written on it.

Like, I guess good for them, the university probably needs stuff like this to generate attention and stay vaguely in the black at this point. It's cheesy and hella cringe (so is the original) but if it helps keep things going for someplace as unique as Gallaudet I don't really have an issue with it.

And a name sign only works if the community adopts it. I don't think Coookeee is going to win over #COKE. Not even Gallaudet has the ability to unilaterally cause a sign to be accepted.  I am not using that. And in the nicest way possible its is a little disappointing that is the end result of the research and so many months of because there was this huge platform they had to get creative. They had a big enough platform they could've standardized a new sign if it had been something better. (I kinda hate it tbh. It looks like just spelling COKE but with the stressors a little stupid and with more effort.) So that part is a bit of a letdown.

The commercial is not really a bad thing. I don't see it as a huge positive, either. I am from other minority communities though that get ignored until someone wants to use our culture to sell stuff and then call it ""authentic"".... so it feels a bit like ""same song and dance"" but this time with ASL. It's a commercial and that's it from my perspective. Its likely to have positive and negative impacts like most big media stuff does, and hopefully it's a net positive.

Mostly I am glad the students got the exposure and resume line from it. I am sure this will be an amazing thing for them, the sort of thing that's a hook and looks interesting enough to get them their first professional interviews. I am happy for them they got that rare shot to do something that big. Deaf students need those opportunities and now more than ever.

I think there may be good intentions in here somewhere, but I don’t enjoy the idea of corporate-branded signs, even with the inclusion of Deaf people.

#UPDATE

I got several messages from community members about this. There are two updates I have to share with you. 

**The first -**

Trudy Suggs, a well-known deaf person, posted on her Facebook about this. Here is what she wrote: 

&gt;Here's an example [referring to the ""Behind the Scene"" video I linked in this post] of how to waste money. We've already been signing this for decades (if not at least a century) without the ridiculous flourish. 

**The second -** 

The instagram account ""signplaying"" posted [a reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJa6G4nRV7t/?fbclid=IwY2xjawKKhMhleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFsdm9ZRjgwRDdyb2htZEJTAR4H9y76WXl2U1UyvPXPoWZ0b351aFiDvej_vy2Kt5NUUSOXbIrTH3l8eb8s8A_aem__J2KBngv3DFANUWDsNoEfg) expressing his views on the new sign for ""coke."" He praised the commercial and suggested an alternative sign for ""coke.""

I saw this on FB. I sign coke like ""syringe"" on arm. I don't know I will ever change that. I am perfectly fine with fingerspelling it in a normal way too. I am dismayed that they spent friggin 8 months on this name brand sign. Cooo-Keeee is not how I'd expect and not everything need to be signed. C-O-K-E is perfectly fine.

It's tax write off for the Coke company. All they have to do is partner up with universities and provide them money for fields, wings, halls, and you name it.  The coke got good publicity out of it

I can see hearing people like it. At least, it is not one of those inspiration porn video or ""try not to cry"" challenges video.

I'm a hearing person, not trying to intrude but I can't help the pattern recognition in my brain.    
       
if this had happened in any other time I would just think mildly positively of it but given that it came out now when cocacola has had lots of troubles with the boycotts, the backlash against that ugly AI commercial, that other commercial to ask people to stop boycotting that made everyone even angrier ecc... it feels like disability washing... if that's it's name? You know like pink washing when companies are like ""look at me how good I am appealing to the gays!"".     
        
Like, are they giving you representation or are they using you to look like the good guys after a streak of extremely negative pr?   
And sure, when is a multinational corporation ever actually giving representation? Never. but it feels even nastier after this, at least to me.    
They tried brown washing and it didn't work.    
It's like they wanted an even holier moral shield so now they are after disability, they want that old lady who says ""bless you heart"" to disabled ppl to be moved.

I’m gonna use the arm poke one now just to spite coke

Anyone here remember the ""New Coke"" fiasco from the 1980's? When you have a major corporation funding “eight months of linguistic research, international community feedback, surveys, and real collaboration..."" that raises a number of ethical red flags as any researcher knows.  As for me,  I will stick with good old fashioned #COKE  Thank you very much.

Hi! It’s surprising—I don’t know why the U.S. is considered the oldest country using sign language, since in other places it was repressed or barely recognized. It’s still fingerspelled there…

Here in Uruguay, we sign “Coca-Cola” using the handshape “Duo” (index and middle fingers), facing forward, with a vibrating movement that goes down in an S-like, snaking motion. Does that make sense?

Not Deaf, but I’d either just spell it normally still, or the injection sign.  Put that right into my veins.

I'm only HoH but question the research they say they've done. Having studied linguistics and ethnography, I just feel it's.... random. I don't know much ASL but I'd hope that they actually involve the majority of the Deaf community in their research. I'd like to know if they did that or if it was a small portion. Sure, language can change but aside from showing a community that doesn't get much spotlight in how they interact with products (a good thing), I will have to side with the members of the community that feel this is redundant.

A new name sign for  coke. I don't hate it, but it's a bit odd way to sign it. I always fingerspelling it. Feels like they are lazy, and they simply ""accent"" it and call it a new sign for coke. 

When I was a lil' kid, I signed coke as a drug on my arm. As soon I grew up, all my peers moved away from an old sign and preferred fingerspell it because the old sign resembled a drug as a needle in the arm.

I saw a guy on IG has an alternative sign for it. I don't hate it, too, but it's still an odd way to sign it because we don't squeeze soda when we are drinking it. What's wrong with simple fingerspelling?l

That…instead of using the syringe sign…hmmm.

NAMESIGN never have more than two handshakes. 


If my memory is right from  my study days no more than two is so universal that language experts consider it a grammar rule driven by language instinct.


I don't see how the commercial helps us... its not like people don't know there is a sign language. 


 I feel this ad trivialize the language by making it seem as  something researchers do in a lab and then hand to the Deaf community. ... imagine a coke ad where researchers make up a new word and claim it's a Navajo word.   


Here is the logic: Deaf ASL employs handshakes  and movement -&gt; any use of handshakes  is ASL ? 
NOPE.

Hah. Fuck Coke, and fuck Gallaudet admin. Besides, deaf people in my region have already given Coke a sign name that Coca-Cola wouldn't like - the act of snorting cocaine with the thumb. I'm gonna stick to that sign, not a corporate sponsored sign.

In Sweden we sign C C which is same sign as cancer haha (of course different mouth)",2025-05-09 01:11:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1ki6frg/cocacola_now_has_a_new_sign_namecoookeee_no/

This is available from various UK sellers and I'm seeing it referring to being able to wake you for messages and notifications from your phone. I think you might want to contact the manufacturer to find out how it actually works, I don't know if you can set something up through an apple shortcut or whether the app you're using would send you a notification that would count for this device.

1ki0tfh,deaf,Can you listen to damaging high volumes on headphones and stuff?,"I understand that for a lot of deaf people, they like music as vibrations so really really loud music might be enjoyable. 

With hearing people, we can’t listen to anything too loud because then we’ll start to lose hearing… but is that a problem when you don’t have any to start with?

[댓글]
Profoundly deaf.  I listen to hard rock music on my Macs wearing Beats Dr. Dre headphones with volume at max. No effect.

We're not the headphone police, knock yourself out.

It depends on how you lost your hearing. For example, people who are sensoneural deaf which typically means their cochlea don’t work we can risk damage to our middle ear and eardrum with loud noises. Tinnitus is common with deaf people.

Deaf also doesn’t always mean zero hearing.

[deleted]

I'm profoundly deaf and I love loud music.  Can just lay back on a wall of speakers with a smile on my face.

I have degenerative hearing loss in both ears and I’ve always listened to my music at full blast. Now my hearing has gotten worse, but I have degenerative hearing loss so I don’t know if it’s decreased because of the volume or because of my hearing loss 🤷‍♀️ idk just listen at a volume your comfortable with; if it’s too loud, turn it down. A lot of people in the HOH/Deaf are already deaf or will be come deaf anyway, and I don’t think many of us care either

Yea, I have my stuff on max volume always

I have a cochlear implant. Anything that comes in had better be at 100%. I'm so thankful my CI has Bluetooth now. I can actually discover new music with ease! Still terrible at it tho.

What gets me is that I've worked a few warehouse jobs including now and in some of those environments they were real gungho about me wearing ear plugs even tho I'm totally deaf. Like it ain't coming back. My brain is gonna be fine.

I listen to my music at full volume because a.) It sounds nice. B.) I can't hear it when it's in the safe zone. C.) I don't really care about my remaining hearing. It's going to deteriorate one way or another and I am going to love listening to my music my way.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

Reading this as I blare my music on full tilt. I'm going to you can further damage your hearing ... Well yes until you hit profound. 

Even then I'm sure there is something to damage. 

That being said I'm gonna enjoy what hearing I have i like my music loud not gonna change now :)

I got these very nice high volume (JLab from Best Buy ~60$) headphones, I'm not completely deaf but I like to hear the background noise as well. I still will listen at 70%-80% for my shows, 90%-100% for music cuz why not feel it in my bones? I completely recommend these headphones for severely-moderate hearing loss people, even people with higher than moderate hearing loss would benefit. It's also wide ears to cover the whole ear INCLUDING the hearing aids, no EEEEE if the ear muffs are directly on the tube or microphone of the hearing aids. 
As for my speakers, I normally listen at 90-100% because again I wanna feel it in my bones? However if I needed to (happens more than you think) I'd need it quiet cuz my mother can hear my speaker in the room next door id listen at 30% if the speaker is within a foot of my ear. 
TV isn't too bad either, if anything I can hear the TV at lower volumes like 10 and my daughter (hearing) would be like I cant hear it and im like if I can then you can. Movie theaters are kind of really loud for me and i get crazy overstimulated after an hour.
I'd like to point out that I have special hearing aids that focus on amplifying surrounding sounds and works harder for me to understand small sounds. 
I think I covered all the areas for volume wise?

I can, but in my case the ship has already sailed and there is nothing much left for me to damage.

I don't use my headphones for music, I just stream it directly to my cochlear implant so I'm not running the risk of physically damaging any internal structures. I'm 100% deaf, but I still use hearing protection/bluetooth so I don't blow my eardrum or something.

I do like the louder stuff as well. Bluetooth + haptic activated on my phone for the vibrations itches that spot.

1khuk5x,deaf,DEAFBLIND BROS: What do you think of Eyeth?,"We were watching this documentary in my ASL 1 class and it said that Deaf people lived on an imaginary planet called Eyeth, which was based on sight, and I thought ""Doesn't that leave out the blind members of the community???""

You're overthinking it. Pro-tactile forms of sign language are far more accessible than speech.

This is a thought experiment that is meant to decenter hearing expectations, not a thought experiment about accessibility utopia. What you seem to want is Universal Design, the concept of creating things and reshaping institutions to maximize accesibility to everyone.

It is interesting to consider what a tactile oriented world would look like, but I'm not blind so I don't know. I'd like to think that powerful magnets are involved so we can sense when someone is close without actually touching them.

[This conversation](http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/dsdj.15499139.0005.004) briefly mentions coming up with a DeafBlind specific variation, “Touth,” but nothing seems to have developed yet from this. As others have said, though, Eyeth is just a thought experiment to illustrate a point, like the trolley problem.

Then we can have EarEyeth, the planet with DeafBlind people!

If Hellen Keller (and others like her) can be taught to communicate I’m sure this imaginary society could manage to help the blind.",2025-05-08 16:34:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1khuk5x/deafblind_bros_what_do_you_think_of_eyeth/
1kh54zs,deaf,"My 3 month old is diagnosed with profound sensorineural hearing loss in his left ear, right side is hearing. He *always* puts his right side of the face down on the bed.

I am new to the community and have only one person in my circle who has hearing loss which occurred later in life, so I thought I could ask here. Is it as obvious as he would prefer to look right because that’s where sounds are coming from even when there is no sound? We’ve oriented everything to try to attract him to the left but he doesn’t look left for more than a few seconds. Would love to hear any input or experiences with single sided deafness. He is not a candidate for cochlear implant. Thank you. [edited for clarity and grammar]

[댓글]
It's quieter that way (?) 

\&gt;He seems to prefer looking toward the right 100%

it's hard to say, the shape of the outer ear does help us detect sounds coming from above us. Why does it matter? he's only 3 months old, he's still learning how the world works and he doesn't know any different than the one ear that works. 

I was born hearing, and lost the use of my left ear in my teens.  I later lost the use of my right ear too but it was much slower. 

lot's of people only have hearing on one side, it won't drastically affect quality of life or success. Late show host Stephen Colbert can only hear on one side, for example.

Idk babies can be adorably weird. Is it possible your kid likes your breathing sounds? Laying his right side down might give him an “ear to the seashell” type effect. 

There’s also a sub for SSD, though I don’t remember what it’s called.

[deleted]

Deaf in my left ear, I sleep with my hearing ear into the pillow. It's quieter that way.

I am deaf in my left ear and hard of hearing in my right ear
With single sided deafness there is no way that one can localize sounds. It probably is a coincidence that he looks to the right more. 

By the way, BAHA and CROS will only help to ‘catch’ sounds that are on the other side of the head and transfer it to the better side. It will not make it possible to localize sounds. 
However, if you are born without the ability to localize sounds, you will never miss it because you don’t know differently.

I was born deaf in my right ear (no cochlear nerve) and hard of hearing in the left. I definitely sleep with my HoH ear down on my pillow. When my kids were babies (they're all in their 30s now), I actually adapted to sleep with my HoH ear up so I could hear them when they would wake up in the night. 

I wish I could tell you what I did as a baby/toddler, but I can't. I do remember being kindergarten age and purposely turning my head so my hearing-ear side faced what I was supposed to be listening to (I was also mainstreamed in school).

I have SSD and I sleep on my hearing side too. I'm very sensitive to noise and tiny little things will keep me awake. It can be challenging to explain to people, as they assume that a hearing impairment must make everything seen quieter, but for me it means that I can't locate sounds very well (crossing the road is a mission) and it's difficult to distinguish one sound from another unless I'm in a very quiet environment with no background noise. It's too soon to tell with a baby as young as your son, but he's probably just doing what feels naturally most comfortable to him.

If he is looking right 100% of the time you should check for torticollis. It’s very common and can be fixed with PT if you catch it early, PT and possibly a helmet if you catch it a bit later. It may not be related to his hearing at all.

I was born deaf in my left ear, and it's always been a lot more peaceful to sleep with my hearing ear to the pillow. In fact, on family trips I'll share tents or rooms with whoever snores the loudest because all I have to do is put my hearing ear to the pillow and it's muffled enough for me to sleep. 

It's fair to be concerned about his reactions to things while he's awake, since you don't have experience with this and can't hear things the way he does. I was born with this type of hearing, and it still took me years to connect my habits to my deafness. I didn't realize I was deaf in that ear at all until age 5, didn't realize I lack the ability to recognize what direction a sound is coming from until age 7, and didn't try hearing aids until I was an adult. 

It took awhile for my family to realize they needed to talk to me on my right side, too, and come up with alternate ways to call out to me when they needed my attention. It sounds like you're paying attention to your baby's habits and how he's communicating with you. As long as you stay aware of those things, you should be able to figure out ways of communicating back to him and fall into a dynamic that works for both of you.

I'm the same. 2018 I got a kanso right ear and that's the ear I sleep on the most, I sleep on my side if I do roll over it's not for long. I don't know why but I've been like that since 🤣 Then when I'm talking to people I tend to turn my head so my implant picks up what they are saying I do wear a hearing aid in my left ear but I can't hear that much, need another implant really but only aloud 1 on nhs. But yeah weird how some people sleep on one side glad it's not just me lol 😁

Yes! I was born single sided deaf and ALWAYS slept on my hearing side. It’s just easier to sleep because it’s silent. He is almost certainly looking toward his hearing side because his attention is going toward the sound, which just so happens to always be on that side. The deaf side is probably just less entertaining.

This was all very similar for me growing up. I will echo that even though he can hear out of one ear, you should LEARN ASL and introduce him to the Deaf community. This is still so beneficial even with one functioning ear, and in my case I’ve lost my hearing in the other ear as a young adult. This would of been devastating, but thankfully I already knew how to sign and was connected with the Deaf community :)

I've been completely deaf in my left ear since adolescence (I'm 32 now). I can't sleep if I'm not laying on my hearing side, although that ear is starting to lose hearing now so maybe I'll be free to sleep on either side eventually lol. My brain likes to kind of... ignore everything from my left side. I have to ""work"" really hard (mentally) to be aware of *anything* happening on my left side. It'll be a learning process for your son as he grows up and starts to interact with the world but he'll be ok :)  


It might be worth checking with his pediatrician, in case this is something neurological, but I guess it's probably just that his hearing side is keeping his attention.

I actually usually sleep on my bad ear. But my hearing loss is conductive due to pressure/drainage/bone problems, not sensoneural. Idk how to describe it, but it just feels better to sleep on the one side over the other. Maybe a pressure change or something. Maybe just bc I'm used to it? Or because of where my bed is located in the room and having my back towards the door? Not too sure to be honest. But I suspect having a sleeping side preference is common among Deaf/deaf and hearing people alike for a variety of reasons. It being quieter may be a part of it!

He want sleep quiet so he chooose to block the sound

I’m single sided deaf since I was 18 y/o. I prefer sleeping on the good ear side since as it keeps noise low and that helps with sleep.

He prefers the quieter version it seems like! 😆 To be fair, he was floating around (extra) peacefully in amniotic fluid unit 12 weeks ago, so it's probably a bit of an adjustment. A lot of babies aren't fans of loud sounds when they're really little.

My ex was similar. She would sleep on one side if it was the weekend and the other if she needed to get up early with an alarm. 

I was a tad jealous of that feature, not that I could be relied on to stay in any position over night. More like a rotisserie chicken me.",2025-05-07 18:45:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kh54zs/my_3_month_old_is_diagnosed_with_profound/

Can anyone tell me some CART providers whose platforms are HIPPA compliant? I am just done with shitty medical interpreters who don't really seem to care that much if they kill me by making up names of medications and diseases so long as the hearies can't tell they're making mistakes.

I am specifically looking for one where the CART tech can be in a telehealth appointment listening like the interpreter and then type what they hear and have it pop up on another app on my screen.

The way the medical group does it's app means nothing works with the app. The have the money to change it and have known for years they need to, so now I am looking for a CART providers whose own platform they supply for the captions is HIPPA compliant.

I am stressed over this &amp; please I do not want suggests for anything else (except perhaps a lawyer prepared to work on contingency against a huge medical corp). Please just keep it to just HIPPA compliant CART services that my doctor's medical group can hire. (Otter and other craptions that the medical company has also blocked me from running on my device during telehealth visits are not a viable option.)

1kgb2k8,deaf,"Want to show appreciation to my crush, tips?","Hey! So I’m a hearing woman and I recently met a deaf man. We met at his school which is specifically for deaf people and I was there to do a play with him and other people from the school.

Over time, I found myself really attracted to him, like, REALLY. I’m rarely interested in anybody romantically so it really hit me hard. Since I was at that school I was mainly around deaf people so I learned some SL, but I still find it hard to properly communicate since I’ve only been there for a few days and have only learned so much.

Now I really like him, but can’t communicate very well. We’ve had some small talks and he’s really nice and understanding to me, but I always find him almost avoiding me (ex: if he enters a room and finds me in it he’d turn around and walk out)

I became really good friends with his friend who is HOH, so it was way easier for me to communicate with him. His friend told me that he’s pretty shy around women and kinda insecure when he’s around hearing people, and I feel terrible considering I might’ve unintentionally left the impression that I pity him for being deaf.

Now I really want some tips on how to be more considerate, I’ve already been to 2 SL classes and going to a 3rd one tomorrow, plus some classes that I took online or on YouTube and I’d say I’m getting pretty good at it, if anybody has any tips I’d really appreciate it.

Probably the widest, thinnest wall ones you can find. Also depends on the size of the hole in your earmould. You'll probably to have to go through some trial and error to find the right size. Don't over-order though as even unused tubes stored properly eventually go hard.

Any chance you can just buy tubes at the reception desk without seeing the audiologist?

Size 13 is the standard size. I order on Amazon. You have to wiggle them onto the arm piece of the hearing aids. It's easy to do. I've done it for over twenty.

with my audiologist, I could email an order and they'd mail them to me.  With these aids, I now have a 100 or so tubes in an airtight lightproof bag.

1kfp2rc,deaf,Has Anyone Else Noticed This? German Measles and Deafness in Males,"I’ve been reflecting on something I’ve observed over the years.
In every case I’ve come across where someone became Deaf due to German measles (rubella) during pregnancy, it’s always been male. I haven’t personally met a single Deaf female who was born deaf because of rubella.

This got me wondering:

1. Could there be an underlying biological vulnerability in male fetuses to rubella’s effects on hearing

2. Or have females been underrepresented or misattributed in these cases historically
Did early research miss something due to its heavy focus on male outcomes

I know the textbooks say congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) affects all sexes, but my lived experience suggests a pattern that hasn’t been widely acknowledged. And patterns matter, especially when they come from the lived experience of communities affected.

Has anyone else noticed this
Especially those in the Deaf community, healthcare field, or those with historical ties to rubella-related cases. I’d really love to hear your thoughts.

[댓글]
I know a woman who was born deaf for this reason. If more people would get their children vaccinated, there works be fewer and perhaps no cases of pregnant women catching rubella.

I know a woman a few years older born deaf because of german measles, and she was lucky it was just deafness, some of the other side effects are terrifying. 

the anti-vaxxing generation has become complacent, they never grew up during these outbreaks and never had to see their classmates suffer the effect of these easily prevented diseases.

Am woman. Born deaf from German measles (rubella). Mom contracted the disease while 3 months pregnant with me.  

Many of my deaf classmates growing up, both male and female, got it due to their mothers getting sick with the disease while pregnant. 

Baby's gender has absolutely no relationship to ""who gets it or not"". Viruses do not discriminate.

My mother had German measles and pneumonia when she was two years old. Apparently she had a high fever and ended up losing all of her hearing. She is 88 years old now!

My mother had that when she was pregnant with me. Yes, I am affected.

There was a [Rubella epidemic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962%E2%80%931965_rubella_epidemic)in the late 50's early to mid 60's.  I was one of those rubella babies.  I consider myself somewhat lucky, deaf + astigmatism + AuDHD, I got off pretty easy. Many other babies died or had congenital syndrome, defects. 

&gt;The rubella epidemic of the 1960s in Canada, particularly between 1963 and 1965, caused widespread concern and significant public health impacts. While rubella (German measles) is usually a mild childhood illness, infection during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, could lead to serious birth defects, miscarriages, and stillbirths. The epidemic led to the development and widespread use of a rubella vaccine, significantly reducing the incidence of the disease and its associated complications in Canada. 



&gt;Thanks to widespread vaccination, rubella has been effectively eliminated in Canada, and the last case of congenital rubella syndrome/infection (CRI/CRS) was reported in February 2024, says Health Infobase. 

It was nearly done for ... now it might make a comeback as the US side of the border is abandoning all the vaccines at the behest of the idiot oligarchies. 

ElbowsUp 💪💪🪖🍁

I am Deaf because of congenital rubella syndrome and I'm a woman!! I was actually the only person in Australia to be born with CRS during my birth year haha. My mum wasn't vaccinated because the vaccine didn't exist when she was born, and she basically never went to the doctor since she moved to Australia because of fear and the culture/language barrier so she didn't know it was a thing. She reluctantly went to a free GP clinic when she was sick while pregnant with me and had a positive test for rubella, when she got the result she casually mentioned she was a few months pregnant and the doctor freaked haha. My mum felt horribly guilty because she felt like it was her fault for not knowing about the vaccine, but I know it's not ""her fault"" in any way because she would absolutely do anything she knows about to help her kids. I was born with a heart defect and a small head circumference, I was developmentally delayed (e.g. I didn't walk until I was 3) although they're not sure now if that was CRS or the autism lol. Surprisingly the rubella didn't come for my eyes so no glaucoma or cataracts for me

My father was born deaf for this reason.

I'm female and likely deaf due to measles in pregnancy.

I am a female born with congenital Rubella syndrome. We do exist. Deaf in one ear and blind in one eye. And a few other things. Let me explain that the condition has no preference to gender. If you were to actually look into to it, there wont be much specific data on which gender gets it the most. My mom was oddly vaccinated (according to her) and I was still affected by it. Dont ask me how. I wouldn't know. But to assume that there's a a biological reason that the people you've met with the condition happen to be male, then you have only met a small portion of the people who have it.

I know dozens of deaf women from the Rubella Bulge generation and even dated a few in college. I was born hearing a few years prior to that and became deaf after contracting measles.

Males are more vulnerable to congenital rubella syndrome and other congenital syndromes in general.

Apparently, male fetuses are more likely to be miscarried than female fetuses. There’s speculation that male fetuses are more vulnerable to all kinds of things, not just illness, than female fetuses. From a purely reproductive point-of-view, it’s beneficial if female fetuses are sturdier and are more likely to survive so they can be born, grow up, and produce more humans someday.",2025-05-05 22:35:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kfp2rc/has_anyone_else_noticed_this_german_measles_and/

That’s so cool. Sadly I’d be stuck with plain old clear ones, if I’d have got my BTE’s a couple months back - my NHS Audiology Dept. don’t do colours….

awesome!

Nice, enjoy the new hearing aids! I got my ears gooped a few weeks ago myself lol

I’ve never had hearing aids like these! What is it like?

I can totally understand that! I distinctly remember the day my parents and I got home from my hearing test when I was 13 and told me I needed to get hearing aids. I threw a tantrum and hid under the kitchen table 😂 We knew for a long time that I would end up needing them but I was so stuck on “old people” only being the ones allowed to wear hearing aids, and if I showed up at school with them, I’d get bullied for it. My brother was a prime example (my dad sold his 75’ impala to get my brother hearing aids similar to the ones you have in elementary school and he refused to wear them - still does 🤦‍♀️) so my dad let me go another couple years without them till I dropped out and finally gave in before I turned 18. And I can totally agree! I had my “best friend” constantly picking at me and bullying me into believing I could change how much I heard by trying harder so I struggle a lot with being able to talk about it with hearing people. Are you willing to talk privately? I could send you a picture too! And it’s not silly! I would actually really love that too. I’ve never been with anyone who truly cared enough about my disability to be part of it too, even indirectly

I'm probably going to need hearing aids in the next decade. 

What I will do is use stanbard in-ear bluetooth headphones and my phone.  I will add a mic to my phone and place that mic close to or pointed at the source of the sound I want to hear.  I have no interest in amplifying everything that is incident to my ear.  I've seen too many people struggle with that approach in crowded or noisy places.

Amazing!

That Roger On device looks cool. I’ve been using my hearing aid with my phone and iPad for years, love that I can go on long walks no stream my music and calls! The TV is my only device that requires a 3rd party device to stream. I’ve always wished TV makers would simply add the stream capability to TVs be the Bluetooth functionality appears to be input only.

Best feeling in the world 🙂

That's a huge huge part of the oral deaf / late-deafened world. Welcome!  I'm a little older than you and it's rough because people our age have kids or other obligations and nobody seems to have time for anything any more.  Do you have a partner you can do things with?  If so doing things as a couple can help with finding community.  I suggest volunteering and see if you find some like minded people that way.  Plus people who do things like volunteer their time tend to be less likely to be bigoted and more likely to meet you half way with a communication barrier.  Good luck!

Are there things that make socialising with other Deaf people hard, or is it just that you don't click with the specefic Deaf people you meeting? It can be hard if the the only place you are meeting other Deaf people are at like Deaf pub style events, and the only thing you have in common is being Deaf, but like someone else said it's totally worth volunteering, or trying to find or start interest groups based on other hobbies you have,

Honestly the number of mainstreamed deaf kids are higher than those who are culturally, big D, deaf school, deaf families, etc - but they are louder. I wouldn’t let it bother you, you’ll find your own pocket in the deaf community.

hello, lip reading and no signig deaf-since-birth here. I'm in your same situation: non disabled people view me as a dumb disabled person and don't actually take me seriously most of the time, disabled people treat me like im not disabled enough for them since I navigate with ease the non disabled world.

My relationship with hearing loss is difficult.

Today I was told by the other LSA that the SM was telling her that she is thinking of demoting me from LSA to SA because of my hearing impairment. SM said that she “fears I’ll have an altercation with customers” over not understanding them. 

I wear hearing aids, have for the last 13 years. However in my long work history (I’m 33, been working since 18), I’ve never had issues with customers. Most are very understanding when I ask them to please speak clearly and speak up a little. I always apologize and let customers know that I wear hearing aids and they generally abide.

My SM knew about my hearing impairment since my interview and since my first day of employment. It’s only been 23 days since I started. I do my job, do what’s asked of me. I don’t know what to think or do about this as I’ve never had this happen to me before. 

Any advice/thoughts are much appreciated.

That illegal!!!! Go look up ada laws abd get a lawyer

She’ll just deny she ever said this. Then find another reason to demote and probably fire. I always thought i’d be protected by the ADA etc .. it is so
difficult to prove, speaking from experience with multiple times something similar has happened to me.

I don't have a ton of information.

I did have some experience with something similar, but I was in a union environment.

If they wanted to demote me, they could, but my pay would be required to remain the same. 

This was also because I'm deaf and their unwarranted concerns with customer interactions (seems like you, months in and NEVER an issue). 

If they were to demote you, would you also take a pay cut?

I feel demoting you based on your hearing, or lack of, would be a form of discrimination?

Hopefully someone more knowledgeable can help.

Contact a lawyer TODAY! get everything in writing as much as possible.

That’s illegal to do, to demote because of hearing loss is a form of discrimination. Take them to court if necessary.

For recording make sure it is a one party recording state so that you’re not facing civil or criminal penalties.

There are tons of memoirs and biographies by and about the deaf. Type something like “deaf memoir” into WorldCat.org and you’ll get lots of options. The issue you’re going to have is finding one that gives you insight into your girlfriend’s experiences, since deafness—especially partial deafness—is such a widely variable experience. If you want to understand your girlfriend, you have to communicate directly with her.

True Biz is a novel by a Deaf author that centers around Deaf teenagers. It also has little nuggets of historical information. I’d recommend it

It depends on whether your girlfriend uses sign language, and/or considers herself part of Deaf culture, the wider deaf community, or neither. These are all different parts of the deaf world, and it’s hard to recommend resources without knowing this.

I agree about talking directly to your gf about it. Perhaps just googling and finding blogs and essays as well. Not sure of your specific issues. The Sound of Metal was an interesting film about someone losing his hearing, just fyi. Prob not much to learn from it, though. 

As someone who is hoh I can only guess: 

- she wants to isolate a lot
- she’s tired of people after coming home from work 
- mental fatigue of trying to piece together verbal info all day 
- subtitles on movies 
- crowded, loud restaurants drive her crazy (if she wears hearing aids) 
- talking to her from the other room or not looking at her when you talk to her or you’re a low talker who doesn’t annunciate 
- not really wanting to see movies in theaters due to lack of subtitles 

Btw… “Disability” is a nuanced discussion, I guess, as there is capital D disability and so on. But I have about 60% hearing loss (and other disabilities) and I do not find the word disability to be offensive or a dirty word. In fact, in my job, it’s the elitist (and ableist) parents who have the biggest problem with that word (“differently able” ugh) and that’s annoying af to me. But to each their own. 

Oh, and I’m glad that I fall under a disability to ask for a reasonable accommodation at work, if needed.

Why don’t you ask your girlfriend, and actually listen to the answer? Far better than reading a book by some rando you’ll never meet. 

Better yet, if she knows sign, start learning it, and immerse yourself in the local deaf community with her.

You could start by not viewing Deafness as a disability.

Not viewing her deafness as a disability is a great start. Empower her instead.

You’re Welcome, Universe; Future Girl; The Silence Between Us; A Song for a Whale; El Deafo; Five Flavours of Dumb; there’s two more but I can’t recall the titles. One has a yellow cover, but I don’t remember the plot very well. The other follows a Deaf kid around through school, but either he may have to switch mainstream or School for the Deaf is closing, or smth like that.

What makes you think that anecdotes or stories from other deaf people will help you learn anything about your girlfriend, who you say yourself is ""partially"" deaf. 

Are you on the autism spectrum? (this is a serious question)

Are you aware that communication is always a 2-way street. If you desire communication with this person you are equally responsible for mitigating communication barriers, such as lack of hearing ability.

1keq6gk,deaf,Deaf or hoh tattoo artist/creative professionals?,"Hello, I’ve noticed a lot of us struggle when it comes to work as it’s a common topic in the sub… 

I’m looking to pivot careers and, as silly as this may sound, my best skill is… drawing. 

As I lose further hearing I wonder if tattooing might be a good field for me? I’m told that communication in tattooing is important but I’m assuming there are deaf/hoh tattoo artists out there who are able to accommodate themselves to make sure they are on same page with client. 

Any other creative field ideas? Seems like graphic design is dying and never really paid well to begin with. 

Thanks!

If you think you would enjoy tattooing then go for it, especially if that means you get paid for a skill you enjoy. Communication is important in every field that involves working with the public, but that doesn't mean it has to be spoken communication.

 I think you could even advertise yourself as a more relaxed experience without the small talk and filler conversation. A lot of people, especially us deaf/HoH folks, are anxious and overwhelmed in situations like these where staff try to make small talk with customers throughout the lengthy appointment.

 You can write back and forth with your client when necessary and when you're working just let them relax, watch a show, or listen to some music of their choice. I think a lot of people would love that experience rather than sitting in a room with a stranger for hours trying to make conversation so it's not awkward.

You just made me laugh - again, this sounds exactly like I wrote it. 😂😂😂

There is a deaf tattoo artist out in La Jolla, CA. You can find her on Instagram at forestsoulstattoo. I actually kind of knew her from when we were at RIT.

Have you made a tattoo on someone? i’m artistic but Ive always thought doing tattoos was very different than drawing.. Curious what you thoughts are on this?

Don’t you hate when people tell you that you can’t do something? Actually this always makes me more determined. So maybe i can use the hate to fuel my energy and prove people wrong 😂

I hit send accidentally.. 

i wish you all the best! I look forward to seeing how everything goes with you. Please do keep me updated.

Not a single response! This makes me bummed out, this is me to a T, although im 100% Deaf. I feel that I’m very good at drawing, i’d love to put this to good use. If you’ve learned anything please let me know! Good luck to you!

Definitely looking forward to it! All the best!

I’m hearing but fairly tattooed, and I can think of a ton of accommodations you could implement. Most of my sessions have been totally silent anyway, I’ll listen to a podcast while my artist does their thing. The most communication happens BEFORE needle gets put to skin, with making sure the client likes the design and stencil size/placement. 

For during the actual piece, the most important things are telling the artist you need to move/stretch, and when you need a break. You could very easily come up with signals (sign, a different gesture, waving to get your attention) for the client to let you know those things. 

In my admittedly limited experience, I have no doubt that a Deaf person could be a tattoo artist! I wish you all the luck in the world, and if you do go that direction, I’d love to see your work and maybe get a piece from you!

I never would’ve thought of this! Something to definitely look into..

Hello, I have been looking for a Deaf artist to design some cover-up tattoos. I have plenty to choose from. If you are interested in working on the design, I am happy to pay you for your work, even if I have to find a different person to do the tattoo. Please feel free to message me.",2025-05-04 18:04:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1keq6gk/deaf_or_hoh_tattoo_artistcreative_professionals/
1kenfg0,deaf,Trying to make Deaf friends,"Hi everyone, my name is William. I’m hearing, but I’ve been learning ASL through online courses for quite a while now. My goal is to become an ASL interpreter in the future so I can support and communicate with the Deaf community.

I’m really interested in Deaf culture and would love to make Deaf friends and have real conversations in ASL. I’m also a really outgoing and friendly guy who loves meeting new people, so if anyone’s open to chatting or practicing ASL together, I’d be super excited to connect!

If there’s ever anything I can help with, I’d be more than happy to lend a hand as well.

I think you mean well, but it’s coming off as condescending. 
If you want to meet up with people Facebook tends to be the best bet, find a deaf group local to you and go to one of their events.

Question: what do you think we need your help with hearing online stranger? What do you think we aren’t capable of? Why would we need YOUR help?

You don't know ASL, but want friends who primarily communicate using ASL, and then ask how you can help like we need your help. 

Why would someone want to be friends with someone who comes across this way?

You need to be socializing with your local deaf community - in person. 

Doing it online isn’t the way. 

And also you shouldn’t be using deaf people to practice with. You need to be socializing and that’s a different kind of interaction.

“Hi! I see you've asked a question. Have you searched this subreddit or checked our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/wiki/hearing) for your question?""

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/deaf) if you have any questions or concerns.*

1. Find a practice group first to get out some of that IM SO EXCITED TO USE ASL ENERGY. Online is fine if there is nothing local, but local is better, and this can be a good gateway to finding out what local Deaf events are also suitable for ppl learning ASL. 


2. If by I can help you are imagining like unofficially interpreting for people, don't.

I don’t think this what the the poster intended.

Go to your local deaf coffee night, check out your community college ASL club.

where i live, there is a couple of coffee houses that hosts a 
d/Deaf meet up every month. 
maybe there’s something similar where you are?",2025-05-04 16:08:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kenfg0/trying_to_make_deaf_friends/
1kemupp,deaf,"Someone, for the love of God pay attention","This sub is pretty dead now, outside of random Hearies looking for ASL. 

Please, PLEASE look at this. Because out of ALL the outrage happening in this country, our community is being decimated. And no one is talking about it. 

Sign language is ""cool,"" and ""beautiful,"" until it means paying attention to the complete, utter, systematic dismantling of everything that those before us fought for. 

EDHI was *never* perfect. But they just added funding in 2024 to measure language acquisition outcomes. Does ANYONE know how hard that was to fight for? 

My friends, colleagues, BRILLIANT people are being fired. Swept under the rug. Funding for Deaf/deaf/DeafBlind/Hard-of-hearing/DeafDisabled survivors of violent crimes...gone. Access to communication, language, the world at large...*poof*

I don't know how to have hope anymore. Please...pay attention.

As an individual with MAGA family who recently learned their baby is deaf, I am 100% sending this to them so they know that it affects their favorite cutie pie grandson, and it matters.

I AM paying attention and I feel hopeless and angry. Full of rage toward Trump voters, particularly my Deaf friends who voted for this destruction of our beautiful community/culture.  My job is at a risk and I don’t know what will happen to my Deaf/HOH clients.

Thank you for the info, I'm a KY resident &amp; will contact Chairman Guthrie's office. My daughter was born with moderate hearing loss and if it wasn't for the newborn screening we might not have known until kindergarten/school screenings. EDHI helped us kick off the early intervention services and now our almost 3 yr old is absolutely thriving. I'll check with the KY Hands/Voices group to see if we can phone/email blast (there was recently a bill in KY, 2025 Senate Bill 93, to improve insurance coverage for children with hearing loss...requiring insurance to cover devices, audiology/medical services, etc and all us parents contacted our senators/reps so it's been passing thru the house &amp; senate).

I see awareness on IG. The issue is people are so apathetic and so me focused that they don't see anything as a big deal until they are personally affected and it's too late by then.

Very few Deaf people are active on Reddit. Too English-based. 

You’re better off finding them on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or even DeafVideo.tv. Spaces where it’s much easier to access information via ASL.

Just saw the cuts (and admission closures) for education programs at Gallaudet, too.

I'm not from the US but I'm from Germany, a country that heavily suffered under Milan 1880 consequences for a long time, so I feel your pain.

I'll try to spread the word to German Deafies who have US friends.

This is infuriating. Obviously these idiots never researched the high percentages for Hearing loss/deafness in the future. Argh. This is a huge set back

Consider my reps contacted.

Any word on if funding for Video Relay and video phone services are going to be impacted any time soon?

I’m not a part of this sub but it popped up. I was raised by two deaf parents. One non verbal. I wasn’t aware this sub existed. I’ve been on Instagram fighting &amp; saying this. We had a recent podcast with our sexual assault shelter where I asked about interpretive services for the hearing impaired. They had not even thought about it because few come in, I explained because the community is isolated &amp; feels unsafe to come forward. 
I appreciate this subs existence &amp; someone from Kansas how we can do more to help? These barriers to care need to be stopped.

I'm here. Lurking but paying attention.

We need to band together and create a hub for activism and advocacy. A place where we can discuss and  develop materials that we can distribute among the deaf community, like scripts on what to say when making calls and etc.

I think it’s impossible to be unaware at this point. The maga militias chaos is completely intentional. I feel sorry for the clowns that still think the orange menace and his maga morons are going to make America Great again. This is what Great looks like to them. Do you have additional suggestions of what to do after we’ve paid attention?

I can understand being upset about programs for the deaf and HOH being eviscerated by this asshole of a president, but EDHI? Please. 

That organization is responsible for language deprivation among deaf and HOH children. They misinform and coerce hearing parents into refusing deaf children the privilege of the signed language. I have zero sympathy for that audist program and the people involved in it. 

Downvote me all you want, but I want to focus on other programs that benefit the deaf and HOH, and this one ain't it.

We all have to pay the price for stupidity of left until now.",2025-05-04 15:44:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/deaf/comments/1kemupp/someone_for_the_love_of_god_pay_attention/
