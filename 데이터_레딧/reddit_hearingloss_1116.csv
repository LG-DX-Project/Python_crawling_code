1oy14m0,HearingLoss,How has my father not lost his hearing yet?,"For as long as I can remember, my father has hunted with his rifle - it's a simple rifle. But I've read that even the most basic weapons can exceed 140 decibels; he doesn't wear any hearing protection. However, I have never heard of any symptoms in the ear, no ringing, no feeling of stuffiness, no pain. Sometimes he asks us to repeat what we said. But overall, his hearing seems to be good, and he's also almost 46 years old. I don't think he ever even dreamed of having audiometry done.

[댓글]
You said he's almost 46 like he's ancient. It's not like like that's old.

Are you sure he has not lost any?

He’s only 45. Give it 10-15 years. That’s when it got noticeable for the people who hunted in my family. Their hearing loss was gradual and they sort of adapted while it happened.

I started competitive shooting in high school. They didn’t do hearing protection back then. Since then, I’ve usually worn some form of ear protection when shooting, but between that and motorcycles, and probably other factors just including genetics and luck, my hearing started falling off in my 40s. Now in my early 60s and I’m borderline moderate to profound hearing loss depending on how good I do at a test. 

It’s slow and cumulative and the effects are often noticed years later.

Would he consider wearing hearing protection?

with shooting, it is often a trauma of just one ear. it is very likely he does have hearing loss, but often times one ear is not noticeable

Give him time   It was all downhill for me once I turned 60.

Plus, occasional exposure isn’t always enough to cause immediate damage. That said, repeated exposure to gunfire without protection does increase the risk over time, even if he doesn’t notice it yet.",2025-11-15 19:51:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oy14m0/how_has_my_father_not_lost_his_hearing_yet/

1oxnyp0,HearingLoss,Anyone here had an exploratory tympanotomy for otosclerosis? Looking for experiences.,"



Hi everyone,
I’m 49M and recently diagnosed with bilateral otosclerosis (Grade IIC) after an HRCT temporal bone scan. I’ve had progressive hearing loss since 2011, currently using CIC hearing aids (since 2022), but my hearing has worsened recently.

Audiogram:

Right ear: ~66 dB loss

Left ear: ~58 dB loss

Mixed hearing loss with a significant air–bone gap

Tinnitus in both ears


HRCT Findings:

Classic otospongiosis around the stapes footplate

Lesions extending around the cochlear turns

Both ears affected symmetrically

No middle-ear or mastoid disease


My ENT diagnosed bilateral otosclerosis with mixed deafness and recommended:

1. Exploratory tympanotomy on the right ear (under MAC)


2. Possible stapes surgery depending on intra-op findings


3. Counseled me that:

There’s a small chance of hearing worsening

Tinnitus may not improve

I may still need a hearing aid after surgery because of the sensorineural component




I’m trying to understand what to expect and hear real-world experiences.

Questions:

Has anyone undergone exploratory tympanotomy leading to stapedotomy?

What was your recovery like?

How much hearing improvement did you get?

Did tinnitus change at all?

Any regrets or things you wish you knew beforehand?


Thanks in advance — hearing from people who’ve been through this would really help. ",2025-11-15 10:00:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oxnyp0/anyone_here_had_an_exploratory_tympanotomy_for/

I wear hearing aids, and I have for years but over the last few years I can tell my hearing has gotten much worse and I am more dependent on my hearing aids, especially to work or when I’m around people in general. I have been to several ENT/audiologist who can’t pinpoint what is causing the hearing loss. One doctor told me Meinere’s disease, but I don’t have any vertigo or balance issues along with my hearing loss. I do not have a history of chronic ear infections, nor have I ever had any damage to my ears. Overall, they look healthy. I am seeking advice on what could be the cause of this and/or what testing I should ask for moving forward to try and get some answers. I fear I will go deaf in the next 5-10 years.

Have you ever had immunological tests or anything like that done?

Bilateral hearing loss is sometimes caused by autoimmunity.

Does your hearing loss get worse when you're sick?

Does it come and go, or do you just notice it's getting worse?

Have steroids helped you when you've had episodes of hearing loss, or not at all? Have you ever been given betahistine?

Decades since I was first diagnosed, still don't know the cause of my HL. Even if the cause of HL is known and is progressive in nature, it is not possible to predict exactly when. My HL was stable during the first couple of decades but then I had quite a steep decrease. 

I had MRIs, test to check for dead zones in my cochlea (which was confirmed but that does not explain the cause), also had gene testing but thus far nothing conclusive. 

While obviously having a diagnosis helps, do think about getting support regarding strategies to manage your HL, this is what is going to be more helpful on a day to day basis.

Hello, is your hearing loss more in the lower frequencies? Has anyone mentioned choclear hydrops? There is a very effective medicine (Betahistine) that’s used for that and it can reverse hearing loss in some. Has anyone told you that besides offering steroids?",2025-11-15 02:59:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oxgne8/hearing_loss/

If I get sick or a virus it attacks my ear cells  and everything is higher ringing and it still attacks me when I’m not sick. 

For the last 20 years my hearing has remained the same as what I’m used to which was moderate hearing loss and got some of it back from taking high dose steroids. 20 years later I’m taking high dose steroids again to prevent the loss of hearing and my parents hope to regain some of my hearing back by having take the steroids.  It’s now severe hearing loss currently and I can barely hear anything. And I’m okay with that. 

It’s surprised me on how much I’m okay with the loss of my hearing and that I am hoping that my high dose steroids don’t work as well as it did last time. Because I accepted the fact that a high probability of me being deaf could happen at any given time. And I’m okay with the fact that someday I’ll need. A cochlear implant.

1ox3vyq,HearingLoss,Sudden profound SSHL in Right Ear. What Now?,"Hi everyone.

Back in March I lost hearing in my right ear. I was at work, had a bit of tinnitus and within a period of about six hours I lost most of my hearing. The actual loss of it felt quite sudden. I had finished up a shower and was getting ready for bed and it felt like my hearing got ""sucked"" away. I was 35 years old at the time.

I went to Urgent Care first thing in the morning, got told there was fluid behind my eardrum, and was provided with a script for flonase and eardrops. This logically made sense to me, as I'd just had a bout of tonsillitis, and with swelling I could see how it might have ""gummed up the works.""

  
The Flonase did not work. Due to some circumstantial crap in my life, and with the presumption I was probably going to need to get tubes in my ears, I was just kind of living with one ear until this month, when I finally got in to see an ENT.

No fluid behind my ear drum. It just stopped working, apparently.

My ENT has floated a cochlear implant, since my main contention is not knowing where sound is coming from. My left ear is perfect, but if I can't see whats making a noise my dumb-brain just assumes Its coming from the side I can hear out of. So being a pedestrian sucks. I've been afraid to ride my bike (which I love), and locating my epileptic dog in my house when he has a seizure has come up a few times (I can hear the noise of him thrashing, but will need to literally search rooms until I can get eyes on him). 

So, I guess I'm wondering if I should go ahead and pursue an implant?

[댓글]
Have you tried a hearing aid ? A CI is a serious decision, not to be taken lightly.

I totally feel you, I went through same thing - sudden hearing loss in one ear at 35, from moderate to profound in a couple of months. when the hearing aid stopped being useful, I was so anxious being out and about. not to mention that besides lack of proper sound direction, my sense of balance and coordination was off too. I was depressed for a while, even stopped listening to music and limited social interaction as much as possible. 
so I went for the implant. 3 months since the activation and my life is back to normal 80%. not fully, because my brain is still adapting to hearing again on the left side, especially with loud background noise.

You

sounds dumb, but is there a reason you need to know where sound is coming from? im Deaf so im just asking because its totally possible to live with no hearing, so im trying to think of why you would need to know where the sound is coming from. best of luck!

I experienced sudden profound SSHL in my left ear 2 years ago.

The biggest concern I had was a sense of disorientation when trying to determine where various sounds were coming from.

I went with a CI and am very pleased with the results.",2025-11-14 18:08:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ox3vyq/sudden_profound_sshl_in_right_ear_what_now/

Only an audiologist can tell, wear earplugs from now on. I didn’t go to events any more frequently than my peers and still ended up with mild hearing loss at 22. It only took 2 years for this damage to happen because prior to going to college my hearing was fine.

&gt;I don't know how I could already be dealing with hearing loss when other people go to loud events constantly and have zero problems.

Some people are more susceptible to hearing loss than others. Kind of like some people are more susceptible to weight gain than others. Sometimes this is hereditary, as is the case with me.

Also, there is an increasing amount of evidence showing that viral infections can cause hearing loss. So, you may have gotten an infection that others didn't.

Go to an ENT, have an audiogram. According to the result, avoid loud events or at least wear appropriate ear protections.",2025-11-13 19:42:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1owat60/temporary_or_permanent/

[댓글]
The ENT is doing genetic testing to determine if my hearing loss is linked to some sort of genetic disorder

Idiopathic. Just woke up one day and had the loss in one ear. 🤷🏻‍♀️

For me, it was Covid...

medication side effect, not progressive but can be.

My original loss was caused by mumps and/or measles, both of which I had at around age 4, before vaccines for them came out. One or both caused moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. I'm told that if I had been born with this level of loss, my speech would not be ""normal"". Because my eyesight was excellent and I'm reasonably smart, and hearing loss was less on the radar then, it wasn't caught until I was about 15. 

I did get tested at school once before that, so someone must have suspected, but they didn't know to conceal their face when reading words, and I lipread. By then I had gotten very good at it, though I wasn't conscious of doing it until much later. A nurse relative met me when I was 15, and instantly made my dad take me to an audiologist for a proper test. I can remember trying my best to lean around the sheet of words they were reading from so I could see the tester's lips. I was very anxious to do well, you see! (I did poorly on the tones part of the test both times, which is another reason the school tester was incompetent. They should have investigated further. Maybe they told my mother she should and she didn't. That wouldn't surprise me.)

I am now in my sixties and have normal aging loss on top of the original loss. That part is progressive, I'm sure. Fortunately, hearing aids have improved amazingly over the decades since I got my first one.

Tympanoplasty for a small hole gone wrong somehow. The graft is currently building sort of an airpocket towards the inside of my middle ear, only holding onto my eardrum on some edges and sitting on the hole like a bubble, mixed hearing loss, conductive and sensorineural from moderate in the mid-frequency range to severe for the low and high ranges.  
Surgeon can't tell me yet if there's anything they can fix and needs me to sit out the last bit of the third month, but so far no changes with my hearing nor with the healing process of the hole, which i check frequently with one of those small cameras.

TL;DR: I got recommended to get a tympanoplasty done to prevent hearing loss and it caused me to lose my hearing on the affected side

I have conductive hearing loss stemming from ear infections, cholesteatoma. May of been other things since this was when I was a kid.

Covid caused inflammation in my sinuses and ears. That compressed a nerve in my right ear. Sensorineural hearing loss, doesn’t seem to be getting better or worse.

I wish I knew the cause. My hearing comes and goes, and my audiograms are still normal, even after almost three years of this starting.

I suspect it's bilateral hydrops and has a certain autoimmune component, since getting sick triggers episodes of hearing loss. The other day I almost got pneumonia, and the high frequencies in my left ear were severely affected

A mix of Cholesteatoma and genetics. its likely not progressive but time will tell

I was a late 70s, sickly kid. Doctors said it was antibiotics, possibly one particular brand.

🤷‍♀️


I've always been like this. Got my first pair of hearing aids when I was 8. At 43 my audiograms are almost identical to what they were when I was a kid. Got lucky in that regard.

ISSHL. They have no clue. Went to bed perfectly fine, woke up without hearing on my one side. Super fun

Not sure but I am allergic to ear drops I was prescribed as a kid and found out one of the medications in it is ototoxic. My original audiologist had said he thought I had hearing loss since I was a kid (from some of my answers to his questioning) so that med is my guess.

No idea but whatever it was (SSNHL) was definitely nerve related as my face, neck and chest went numb at the exact same time and took a few weeks for the numbness to go. (Was the same feeling as dentist anaesthetic)

Genetic for me and progressive. Father and one older brother have impaired hearing. Two out of three of my brother's children have hearing loss. One is in bilateral hearing aids, the other in bilateral cochlear implants.  All of us have physical signs of the condition which is pre-auricular pits.  Other siblings with normal hearing do not have the pre-auricular pits.  It was determined that the disease is called BOR(branchio-oto-renal) syndrome. Branchial portion is the pre-auricular pits. Oto is genetic hearing loss. Renal involves potentially anomalies with kidneys which manifested in my older brother as congenitally missing one kidney.

High dose chemo &amp; stem cell therapy.  Signed up to lose hearing, but it saved my life. 🙏

In my case due to cervical injury and a lot of stress and anxiety😔

Not sure yet. Covid seemed to trigger it so they are leaning towards autoimmune inner ear disease

Baby, I was born this way 🎵

Well for me part of it is from too many concussions in life. Another part was from having caught some weird sickness for 6 weeks straight. But now come to find out, I might have an autoimmune disease that did some damage as well (so far I only know I have celiac disease, but ENT thinks I might have some autoimmune inner ear thing)...

I was told it is progressive. I have moderate loss in right ear and moderate/moderate-severe loss in left ear.",2025-11-13 12:21:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ovzn2d/what_was_the_cause_of_your_hearing_loss_is_it/

I tried a bone conduction device, and for the first time in a long while, I felt part of the world again. Not totally, of course, the negative was still there. 

If you have struggled with hearing loss, what's helped you feel connected again?

I certainly miss ""laughter, whispers, and moments you can't rewind"". But I also notice things that people with normal hearing take for granted like the body movements, facial expressions, gestures and even the space between silences ... these help me connect differently.

Learning to let go. Let go of the things you can’t hear, the moments that you missed, etc. I’m still struggling with it, but I stopped isolating myself. I came to terms with the fact that I’ll inevitably miss some moments, but I’ll miss even more moments if I avoided interaction.

You did a great job explaining what it's like to gradually lose your hearing.

yesss. i am not profoundly deaf but even in the last year my hearing loss has gotten a bit worse. i was just telling my boyfriend about how i can't hear rain outside my bedroom window anymore unless it's like pouring and i miss out on so much social connection at school. i had a moment on halloween where i thought someone was breaking into my house bc i had my hearing aids in while just sitting around (which i never do i usually take them out as soon as i get home but my bf and i were planning to go out) and i heard the fridge noises for the first time! it was so loud. and i never realized that my footsteps are not completely silent. i'm not some quiet-bandit sneaking around to get snacks at night. its funny sometimes with these little things, but then i really get to thinking about it and it's so isolating. having to lipread constantly, having to give vague nods or answers because i can't hear.. i never feel truly feel like i am a part of a conversation with people unless its in asl

  
i'm still struggling to find positives too but i think that for now, one of the best positives is that none of us are truly alone in this. there are other people experiencing the same things no matter how far away they may be

I have hearing loss and tinnitus (I'm almost deaf in my left ear) I tell people who are close to me about my issues. Its good to talk about it from my own personal experience so people that are close to you have a better understanding which helps in social settings.

1ovvntd,HearingLoss,how to cope with my mom?,"i am 20 and i found out i have ssnhl last november (2024). i was retested a few weeks ago and my hearing loss has gotten worse. i have had hearing aids since january 2025 (so almost a year as well) and typically when i am home, i don't wear them. as soon as i get home from school i will take them out and rely on asl with my bf or him and my family needing to speak rlly loud. this has caused some issue i guess with my mom. she refuses to talk about my hearing loss or acknowledge my hearing aids. she's always done this when i've asked her to repeat, but its been worse lately \~ she'll ask me to do something and i'll have to ask her to repeat 3-4 times. on the last time she'll either shout it at me angrily or if she's not in an angry mood, will do a ""deaf"" voice/accent and move her hands around to mock me and signing... i've told her its ableist and she's told me idk what i'm talking abt and to stfu with that. i told my bf about it recently because i guess he hasn't ever seen her do it to me (i thought he had), and he kept telling me that that was really really bad and that he was really sorry and couldn't believe her. now i've been thinking about it so much.. i usually will just walk away from her and not interact for a little. how do i even deal with this? i'm terrified of losing my hearing fully, i miss hearing the rain outside my bedroom window, or not having to feel so isolated in conversations.. and she's made no effort to understand me. how am i to cope??

[댓글]
I have a person in my life like this too. I think really the only advice I can give is that instead of telling her ""that's ableist"" when she mocks you (even though it totally is), try to express that it hurts your feelings specifically. I have family members that will say incredibly prejudiced things, and I've had more success with expressing to them why those things are painful to me personally than I have with labeling their behavior for what it is. Sucks, but it's worth a shot.

Have you talked to her about why she's having such a hard time with your hearing loss? I know it's a pain in the ass to be empathetic in these situations to someone doing and saying some cruel bullshit to you, but if you can get her to give you literally any information about what's going on in her head with this it may lend to an actual conversation between you both. Where you can maybe get your point of view across to her too.

Of course, your hearing loss is your hearing loss. And you shouldn't have to do so much heavy lifting to get people to understand and stop being dicks about it. So if you'd rather just ignore that shit and figure out how to cope in your own space, that's more than fine. I recommend looking up blog posts or articles from others who have shared their stories about navigating hearing loss, how they've made positive space for it in their lives. And don't be afraid to be upset about it! It's tough. But there's community everywhere and it never hurts to reach out and see what people can lend a hand with.

I'm losing my hearing too, and it's incredibly scary at times. It's even scarier to have people who just don't get it. I feel for you my friend. Hope things get easier soon!

She doesn’t care about being ableist and she might not care that it hurts your feelings, but people who don’t feel much guilt can still feel embarrassed.

So use that. Tell her that the fake accent and signing gibberish look dumb. Laugh at it. Tell other people about it. She’ll probably throw a fit but then the behavior might stop.

My parents are more reasonable, and sometimes taking a different approach helps — telling them that I *want to hear them*.

I have tinnitus at times it comes and goes, it ear also feels like it's muffled or i have an ear plug in all the time. My right ear also is very sensitive to pressure changes and will shift my balance if I'm walking or running.

1ovfk4a,HearingLoss,Middle Ear Fluid/Hearing Loss-Toddler,"I am hoping to get some advice. About four months ago now my 16 month old son (then a year old) had a series of colds, fevers etc. While they may be unrelated, it is also around this time he seemed to start a speech regression. He was saying about 12 words regularly and would repeat when prompted. Then he stopped and with some words would only mouth them. For example UP was a very clear loud command he would use several times a day and then one day he just started mouthing UP with no sound and then stopped doing that a few days later. He still says Mama and Dada but not often and they sound different to how he used to pronounce them which was once very clear. The rest of the words he completely dropped and has not spoken any new words since. 

 I took him to the doctor this week to address his speech regression and she checked his ears  said there was no visible issues but suggested he may have hearing loss and scheduled a hearing test.  Unfortunately the nearest available appointment was a month out. 

When researching speech regression and some of his behaviors, it seems to me like he may have fluid in his middle ear. His symptoms and behavior seemed to line up with discriptions of that condition. 

My concern is that if he does have middle ear fluid resulting in hearing loss/muffled hearing, I feel terrible to make him wait a month to find out. Is there any way or any suggestions of how I could possibly have  a Tympanometry or other test to diagnose this sooner?  How can I help address this in the meantime? When I go to the hearing test in a month will they automatically do this test? 

Some additional information:
-My son can hear, which is why this never occured to me. He can hear music and TV but the doctor suggested he may not be able to hear the frequency of voices. 

-He used to love being read to, he would sit for long periods of time and listen to us read to him but now is impatient and wants to turn the pages without paying attention to reading which makes me feel like he can't audibly follow along with the story. 

- My daughter had her adenoids/tonsils removed due to fluid and frequent infections. Additional family members have required ear tubes. 

-He almost always sputters on fluids when drinking no matter the cup or vessel type. 

-He makes eye contact, has good fine and large motor skills (it is hard to gauge balance and clumsiness at this age) but he seems to walk, run and climb well. He makes noises but more like laughing and shrieking when happy or crying when upset. He can shake his head ""no"" and point to things he wants. 

-He does seem to prefer to play solo and mostly ignores other kids his age. 

-In addition to scheduling a hearing test, he is also scheduled for a speech therapist and early intervention appointment to assess and evaluate his behavior and aid in whatever is going on but again those are all a month to a month and a half from now.

1oveckt,HearingLoss,Help please,"My husband has experienced sudden hearing loss in his right ear. Prednisone brings the hearing back. After he's completed the course of steroids he loses his hearing again. 

1st ENT he was tested by an audiologist, unfortunately, while he could hear due to being on Prednisone. MRI was performed and was normal. He refers him to another doctor. 

2nd doctor says he needs a hearing aid. He went over the hearing test being good, which we kept expressing was taken while he was able to hear normally. He said he's never heard of anything like steroids bringing hearing back like my husband is explaining and it going away once the course was completed. 

My husband has been on two 16 day courses of steroids and two 3 day courses with a current 10mg a day after the last course. As long as he's on it he can hear. Once completed, after a few days he loses hearing in that ear again. 

The doctor suggested a hearing aid. I think he should have a tearing test when he can't hear to see what it is.  

Does this sound like age related hearing loss being in one ear only and with it reacting to steroids in this way? 

Any suggestions for the next doctor would be helpful and appreciated.

AIED (Auto-immune inner ear disorder) causes sudden sensory-neuro hearing loss that can be restored (not always, but often, in part or full) with corticosteroid treatment (prednisone). The prednisone weakens the immune system, which decreases or removes inflammation. Inflammation is the cause of the sensory-neuro hearing loss (if other causes have been ruled out via MRI and basic visual inspection of the ear for blockages or damage).

Some ENTs and audiologists say that this type of hearing loss can come and go; others think it's weird that it repeats. That prednisone results in your partner's hearing improvement is indicative that inflammation is the underlying cause of their hearing loss. An ENT or other specialist (not an audiologist) can help determine why and what to do about it.

They always recommend prednisone for hearing loss. Whether he needs to take it long term is the question. Or something that works that he can take until it resolves

It sounds like an autoimmune condition; it's important to return to an ENT specialist soon to continue steroid treatment and slow the progression and/or restore hearing

From your description, I think that your husband needs more doctor investigation to get to the root of the problem.

He has some kind of recurring inflammation in that ear that’s causing the issue. The docs need to find an anti inflammatory drug he can be on more long term whilst this is being resolved.  
You could potentially test him on Etoricoxib daily for now and see if it helps?

Steroids injection will be the better option

I have recently been diagnosed with SSHL and have been very impressed with this android app for doing home measurements of hearing. And you can easily view/compare the results of tests over time.

1ov96y9,HearingLoss,Acute Acoustic Trauma Is There Any Hope (22),"This past Saturday I went to an outdoor shooting range for the first time where I shot a 9mm, .380 handgun, and a 12 gauge shotgun. I was there for about 25 minutes shooting a few rounds of the handguns and a few shells of the shotgun. I only wore the little foam plugs they give you. After I I noticed ringing and hearing loss in my ear. Stupidly my uncles took me to bar where I was there for 2-3 hours watching a Mizzou football game. The next two days the pressure in my ear decreased and the tinnitus tone and ringing fluctuated but I didn’t feel much improvement of my hearing. Three days after the shooting I had an audiogram that showed severe loss in my right ear and I was prescribed prednisone which I took about 75 hours after the incident. I am trying to come to terms that I do have some permanent damage, but is there hope it will get better? Currently on day 4 and the tinnitus feels a bit softer and lower in volume and my ear pressure continues to feel down.

It's severe damage, and there will probably be some permanent damage, but it's hard to know how much until you finish treatment in a couple of weeks.

The tinnitus subsiding could be a sign of improvement.

And this why I don’t shoot guns hopefully you’ll have to cope with it as hair cells in your ear mostly likely died as they don’t regenerate. Bright side they”re hearing aids and they work wonders my friend don’t give up hope I heard they are finding a cure for hearing loss.

the bad news is  its a pretty severe cookie bite loss (mine looked so similar when i first started losing hearing). the great news is its only one ear! most people with unilateral hearing loss dont notice it too much. when i had unilateral loss, i really only noticed it when my right ear was blocked (like laying on a pillow)

🤔🤔🤔🤔

75 hours is still kind of OK, consider early intratympanic injections since your loss is severe.",2025-11-12 16:05:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ov96y9/acute_acoustic_trauma_is_there_any_hope_22/
1ov8g7w,HearingLoss,Hearing Loss and Tinnitus - First time at a gun range,"Went to an (indoor) gun range 4 days ago. As soon as I removed the over the ear hearing protection, I noticed that my one ear was muffled and felt off. 

It’s been a few days and I’ve improved in the sense that I no longer feel ringing throughout the day (now it’s only once or twice) and my hearing feels way clearer than the day that the noise exposure occurred. 

But given that it’s been some time I feel so unsettled and just want my hearing back. Has anyone had a similar experience? Did the muffled feeling go away? That’s all I want at this point. I’ve seen a doctor who said my ear drum looked normal. They gave me a referral for an audio test but that’ll take a while in order to get scheduled apparently. 

Any help, advice, or personal stories are appreciated.

See an ENT ASAP (some medicine could limit the damage). Unfortunately, once the hearing cells are dead, they don't grow back. Have an audiogram to evaluate the damage, if any.

You can get into Costco ASAP to get an audiogram. That should be the priority. Don't delay treatment for this. Steroids *could* help with some of the hearing loss if there is damage, but only if they are started very soon after the trauma.

Did you at least get to enjoy the range? I'm assuming you're a new shooter or went with a friend. Probably were shooting a rifle/shotgun, and your affected ear is the side you shouldered it on. In the future, make sure to wear standard hearing protection plugs under your ear muffs. Some of the ear muffs can fail under certain circumstances so you'll at least have some stop gap. Also have your friend / range instructor check your form when you shoulder it. It would be good to have some plugs on hand for concerts as well!

Wishing you all the best and a speedy recovery! The improvement is a **very** good sign, but please do follow through with testing.",2025-11-12 15:38:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ov8g7w/hearing_loss_and_tinnitus_first_time_at_a_gun/

* Needing more focus in noisy places
* Speech sounding “less crisp” than before
* Ringing that comes and goes
* Ear fullness without pain

1ouz7ww,HearingLoss,Help me decide if i should continue with the traumatic Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy,"So my SNHL happened on July 8th, I started Valacyclovir, Prednisone on the 5th day. Until then i had the hearing and tinnitus issue only on the right ear but after the first dose, could be coincidence as well, i started getting T in my left ear as well. My T kept fluctuating for 1-2 months and then settled for about consistent and more charged up on the right ear, and minimal on the left. The left one mostly resolved with ear wax removal and i feel that only at few times. The right one is a mystery! Since end Aug it was escalated and then in between i had 1-2 days of calm. In past few weeks i experience what i fear was a mini vertigo attack but has not occured since. I didn't and don't have vertigo.

Now a few weeks ago, i started taking a homeopathic medicine Chinnium Sulphuricum 6C for about a week 3x daily. Unfortunately i ran out of it and could use it till a few days ago now when i got another bottle. Close to this time i also started taking milk mixed with tumeric at night and omitted tea. My ENT also upped by betahistine from 16 to 24 mg so all these 3 things happened simultaneously. Then about 4 months into it i was about to give Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy a try and just 1-2 days before i noticed my T had calmed down alot. I had only 15 mins of oxygen therapy for my 1st session and my T was good for the whole week. Then i did 3 more sessions and my T has been fluctuating but there has been a lot of stress as well due to my upcoming  MRI which had to be cancelled hours before, etc. As of today, my T is back to being quite noticeable but i just had a very bad day yesterday so i think it all affects it.

Anyways coming to my dilemma now…Should i continue with hyperbaric? I was told it has very less chance of working at this stage and i am also not being able to take the sessions consecutively or fully.

My 1st session- 15 mins

My 2nd session- 81 mins

My 3rd session- 90 mins

My 4th session- 75 mins

My 5th session- 45 mins

\*These are the times i was in 2.4 pressure and does not include the time it takes to build up the pressure and exit.

I have Claustrophobia and the fact that i was able to even do as much as above is shocking for me. I do take lorazepam as prescribed for it. But I don't know i have yet again since 2 days ago developed a fear of going in the chamber again. It could be due to the stress in last few days as well as in my last session i almost panicked as i was trying to call the attendants but nobody responded and i had to knock in panic twice while in chamber. Mind is a very tricky thing, it made me go in the chamber for these sessions for sake of healing but now its acting up again.

At most i would be able to cover 10 sessions as i go away 1st week of December and will come back in Feb.

I have noticed that my stress level can really affect my Tinnitus ALOT. My hearing loss is considered mild with dbs lost at 500, 750 and 1000 and 45 dbs being the highest. I don't feel issue in hearing in general, i think our bodies adapt quickly to these changes as well and the other ear perhaps compensate for the loss. My left ear also showed slight hearing loss in between but as per last test in Oct it has resolved. However the right ear and the low frequencies loss remain about the same.

Please tell me what should i do? I am very anxious about this decision as i don't want to regret that i didn't try this as it could have helped recover the hearing, or helped with the T. On the other hand i feel i am putting myself under alot of pressure and stress.",2025-11-12 07:52:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ouz7ww/help_me_decide_if_i_should_continue_with_the/
1ouy7f7,HearingLoss,I didn’t understand how bad it was.,"I’m 33m. I have hearing loss with tinnitus and misophonia. I got my first hearing aids today. Holy shit, I didn’t realize how much I was missing. ENTs and audiologists had told me that I had mild hearing loss. So thought mild can’t be a struggle, deal with it. I also have “mild” cerebral palsy and this was the attitude trained into me from childhood. I was nearly 30, before I could even accept that I am disabled. I’d constantly miss what people were saying, have to ask them to repeat themselves or I’d just give up on conversations. My biggest struggle was my own volume. My dad would say, “you have two volumes: mumble and scream.” But I really thought I was speaking clearly. It’s become more of the struggle the past 10 years. I got my hearing aids programmed today. Work was so much easier, phone calls were so clear. I didn’t realize how hard I was working at things other people had no struggle with.

Wow, I am so glad it is working for you.  You have motivated me to get one myself.

1ouhfg1,HearingLoss,Help deciding if to start prednisone,"Hello,

My husband (55 years old) with a history of some hearing loss and tinnitus, suddently had on the right ear a feeling of muffled sound, fullness, and increased tinnitus pitch (but the hearing test showed the right ear has a decrease on 8K from 40 to 70).  He did not have any cold/flu or other symptoms. Can it still be caused by a virus that needs Prednisone?  He was waiting to see if the feeling of ear fullness got better (it did a tiny bit), and we did not know we had to act right away and we are on 3-3.5 weeks right now :(  (we waited for an ENT appointment, then for a hearing test, then for labs to check his glucose and pre-diabetes levels, then checking with his primary doctor, etc...).  All this to say, it's probably 3 weeks or so since his sudden hearing loss, and that it seems we took too long to act not knowing there was a time element.   We are concerned about taking Prednisone 60mg for 14 days (and then tapering) since the doctor said it may increase his glucose (his glucose is 97.1 and Hemoglobin A1c of 5.8% and we read about steroid induced diabetes). We also heard it may mess up your gut (he has had issues with ulcers and gut issues in the past and he is finally in a good place with his stomach). His primary doctor said it should be ok to take Prednisone, but we are wondering if it is worth the possible risk, and also we are not sure if it will still make a difference on his hearing since it has already been like 3 weeks.  Will it still make a difference to start this late?  Is there a big chance of Prednisone having permanent effects like diabetes or ulcers?  If we start Prednisone 60mg, do we take them all 60mg at once, once a day?  Or do we split it in like 30mg in the morning and 30mg at night?  Thanks!

I could not tell from the post, but if there’s a new onset hearing loss, it is always worth a try to give steroids. If you’re concerned about diabetes or other side effects, ask for intra-typmpanic steroid injections.

Start prednisone ASAP. The sooner you begin treatment the greater the likelihood of recovery. Prednisone is an anti-inflammatory medication, not an anti-viral medication. Your husband’s blood sugar is normal, if in the upper range, and the doctor would not have recommended prednisone if s/he didn’t think it were best and advisable. Short-course corticosteroid treatment is unlikely to induce diabetes. If your husband can walk before/after meals or exercise daily, that will decrease his blood sugar while on prednisone. Typically, a physician will prescribe omeprazole (generic Prilosec) with high-doses of prednisone to decrease stomach acid and alleviate potential gastric symptoms caused by prednisone. Omeprazole also is available over the counter. You should speak to the doctor about dosing. In my experience, total daily prednisone doses are divided by 3 and spread out through the day (every 8 hours or breakfast, dinner, supper). It’s best to take prednisone with food. Best of luck to you and your husband. I hope he will recover more of his hearing.

Worth a shot. It’s a chance to regain some hearing. Prednisone is a common steroid. Taken it at least 5 times.  Yes the mg for hearing is a lot

14 days of prednisolone at that dosage has a very low chance of doing any of those things. 

This is sudden hearing loss. It's a debilitating disease, and you're telling me you're afraid starting the only treatment that has shown any kind of improvement, because it might increase his already normal glucose levels to maybe the upper normal limit. 


Find a proper doctor and do whatever he tells you to do, you're not informed enough to decide if he should start treatment or not.

I’m not a dr and I can’t give you medical advice. BUT, Drs at least here in the UK have to weight up benefits of treatment vs potential complications or side effects. 

If your Dr has done that (sounds like they have) then I would start treatment. You could always get a second opinion. 

For what it’s worth, I’ve taken steroids on and off for years due to asthma. In terms of side effects, I’ve only had heat intolerance. But we are all built differently.",2025-11-11 18:34:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ouhfg1/help_deciding_if_to_start_prednisone/
1ouf31k,HearingLoss,Hearing aid costs,"I noticed I’ve been asking people to repeat themselves more often, particularly my young children.  I’ve also always struggle with conversations in noisy environments.  So I went to get my hearing checked and I have mild to moderate hearing loss (30-50dB) in the high frequencies (1500hz+). 

The audiology center was a Beltone practice and showed me hearing aids that were $5500. They weren’t pushy or even suggesting the higher end models for me. But it still felt expensive for minimal benefit.

I did some internet searching and I have seen other options that are $1500. So for someone with my amount of hearing loss what’s the difference between a $5000 and $1500 hearing aid?

EDIT: I have insurance that will cover a good chunk of the cost of the more expensive option, so for is about the same. Just wondering the difference in quality, features, etc.

If you have a costco in your area check their prices.

If I were you, I might speak to the audiologist about it. Some more sophisticated hearing aids can be set up based on your audiogram, and so in that way, they are able to focus on the frequencies you need most (and can change those frequencies as your hearing loss changes over time). They also can focus on amplifying the frequencies used most in human speech, to improve word recognition. Similarly some of these hearing aids can dampen loud “noises,” things like pots banging around or dog barking. Some over the counter hearing aids simply amplify all sounds at all frequencies. If the price were going to be the same to you, I would tend to go with a hearing aid option from an audiologist.

It's at these times that I'm grateful for the existence of my country's public health system, lol.

1ou67qp,HearingLoss,My ENT left me confused.,"Recently, I was diagnosed with hearing loss in the 6000 hertz and 8000 hertz frequencies. The most likely cause was excessive use of headphones, which as far as I know is characterized as NIHL. However, when I asked my ENT on Instagram whether this type of loss is progressive, she said that my case is not NIHL. So, I asked her what type of loss I would have, but she didn't answer me. I still don't understand.

[댓글]
...On *Instagram*?

Your audi isn't going to get into details about your medical condition on insta. That would be a HIPAA violation. Call them or go see them.

Can you show us the audiogram? Either way it’s impossible to tell exactly what caused your hearing loss. Typically, and speaking by the textbook, classic pure noise induced hearing loss is sometimes evidenced by a “notch” hearing loss, usually between 3000-4000 Hz. Depending how old you are, there may be several reasons behind why you have a hearing loss from 6000-8000 hz. Just make sure to face people when you talk to them, reduce distance, and reduce background noise when communicating.

High frequency hearing loss at 6000-8000 Hz is actually common with long term headphone use. Your ENT may have said it’s not NIHL because classic NIHL usually shows a notch around 4000 Hz, not 6-8 kHz.

What you likely have is high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which isn’t always progressive unless noise exposure continues. Reducing headphone volume and taking breaks can really help.

If you are unsure, getting an audiologist to explain your audiogram in detail can give you much more clarity. You are definitely not alone. This happens to a lot of people.

No idea why you have your medical professionals on social media lol. Anyways, noise induced hearing loss is only progressive if you continue what caused it. If you continue the noise exposure, it could get worse. If you stop, it wont",2025-11-11 10:38:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ou67qp/my_ent_left_me_confused/

Could be hearing loss in low frequencies, ""reverse slope"". You need to get a hearing test from an audiologist to know for sure.

Overwhelmed by cost and having imposter-syndrome about wearing them. Need to know if ppl with similar diagnosis wear hearing aids and if so, has it helped you?*

*Where my cookie-bite pattern people at? as they say... (No one says that....) (Or maybe we just didn't hear them.)*

Hello,

First time poster here. I was diagnosed with mid-frequency hearing loss  in 2020. I realized that I had trouble understanding masked people when I couldn't read their lips anymore. My mom told me that she noticed her hearing declined starting at age 30. I was 31 in 2020. So, ENT/Audiology concluded it is a genetic hearing loss (after my MRI results showed no brain tumors, or whatever.) I got another hearing test this year and it showed the same ""cookie bite"" shaped pattern, only slightly worse.

My high and low frequencies are pretty ""normal."" But my mid frequencies are 60-70 dBHL, so like, moderately severe. Human speech is mid-frequency so, I notice it the most when communicating with a group of people or in public at all. I often dissociate and once I realize I've lost the plot of the convo, I just give up and dissociate more, or pretend I'm contemplating. I just always assumed that my dissociation was mental illness, but I am starting to think that my hearing loss is literally severing my connection with people, slowly over time. Dramatic? Maybe not. **Does anyone here (hear) relate?**

It's pretty silly but I have a sense of imposter syndrome, especially when I talk about this with friends or coworkers, like if I were to get hearing aids, I have this intense fear that I'm actually faking a disability. (Yeah, I should prob see a therapist about that one!)

I did recently test hearing aids with my audiologist and the *Phonak Audeo Infinio Ultra R* seemed like the best quality for me. I am reluctant to buy because of the cost but, 1) I fear my hearing will get worse if I don't use hearing aids and 2) I hope it will improve my quality of life (at work, in group settings, and boosting my confidence overall.) Though I worry that the latter won't be true.

1osj5zo,HearingLoss,exposure to loud sound,"Hi there,

for background information - my school provides a metal technology program which includes welding. on Friday (2 days ago) whilst welding i had lit my hand-held torch but forgot to turn on the oxygen. the residual oxygen in the torch allowed the flame to last for 7-ish seconds before the flame went out and produced a loud *pop*. i was slightly taken aback, realising the oxygen hadn’t been turned on, and realised my right ear had a mild ringing for about a minute. this may’ve also been occurring in the other ear, but i hadn’t taken the time to notice. 

fast forward to Sunday night (right now) i’ve been feeling pretty anxious since the ordeal and i feel i’m slightly hoaxing myself into believing i have tinnitus when i lay down if i truly focus on my thoughts but i havent given it much thought whilst ive been out this weekend.

do you think i have experienced hearing loss? i may add, no, i havent given not been to the doctor (albeit, all damage is permanent, so i see it as a waste of time) but - why not a reddit post to clear my head id appreciate any and all opinions!

1os1gsf,HearingLoss,"After 30 years, I lost patience with my husband.","After 30 years, I lost patience with my (now separated) husband. I have told him for DECADES to 1. get my attention before he starts talking, 2. face me when he speaks to me and 3. speak in proximity.

For decades, he has been irritated at me when he's speaking but he's not in proximity and often not facing me. He has a very quiet accent and talks to me from other rooms, in hallways, and walking in front of me. Even in proximity, he will begin speaking at a reasonable level but then he trails into more quiet speaking as he continues to ramble.

He constantly blames me for 1. not listening or 2. not getting hearing aids. I have a very large social circle and work in noisy places and he is one of the only 2 people I have trouble hearing. Both speak especially softly and with accents.

I used very harsh words with him and I'm taking a time out.

Even if /when we divorce, I'm hoping we will retain our strong friendship but I'm just DONE with 30 years of him not modifying HIS behavior when I give him explicit directive on how easy it could be to just get my attention first, speak in proximity and speak facing me.

Advice?  Thank you.

Both of you should see an audiologist and counseling for speech understanding 
We see patients who describe what you’re going through and it’s helpful for the spouse to hear the audiologist say “with their hearing loss you need to face them etc”.

My other advice would be to get hearing aids. It appears you do need them even with your large circle and hearing others fine besides one or two soft speakers with accents.
You are missing pitches/tones because you have a hearing loss.  It will get worse over time and you are increasing your risk for cognitive decline. Addressing it now instead of eventually or never will increase your quality of life (and your marriage). Yes he needs to face you when speaking to you but you also need to address your hearing loss. Do it together. 

If you both don’t want to address the issue and solve the problem together you will divorce. You will not be friends.

I recommend couples therapy. it appears that you both have a communication problem. I have a partner who mumbles, but I took a hearing test and discovered I had hearing loss. Hearing aids have helped - not perfect - because HAs won't help you understand someone who mumbles (you will hear their mumbling better - haha). Seriously though, try couples therapy and get a hearing test. There's nothing to lose.

I don’t have any advice but I feel your pain. I had to sternly tell my partner that if he thinks my hearing loss is a PITA for *him*, imagine what it’s like for **me.** 

I wore hearing aids for 30+ years but I’m effectively deaf now. I have to use an AI transcription app to “hear.” My partner is still struggling with having to get my attention before speaking (even though I’ve always needed him to do that, but I need it now more than ever.) He wants to talk while the tv is on but my app picks up the talking from the tv and it shows up as a garbled mess. I’ve explained this to him but it’s like an abstract concept he won’t grasp.

OP, I don’t think either of us are asking too much. It *hurts* to be refused such simple accommodations. I don’t think most people understand the mental effort it takes for a HOH person to keep up with conversations. It’s like we’re always one step behind having to use context to figure out the words that were said in the *last* few sentences. It’s literally exhausting. If you explain this to people, especially a spouse, you would think they’d be more empathetic, but obviously that’s not always the case.

In regard to hearing aids, they are helpful , life changing even, but they only do so much. They’re not the easy solution your husband thinks they are. Not everyone can wear them all day either. Mine gave me headaches towards the end of the day. Taking them out gave me as much pleasure as taking my bra off at the end of the day, lol. Even if you got HAs tomorrow, your husband would still be disappointed one way or another.

With all that being said, I think you would be doing *yourself* a favor by getting your hearing checked.  Well, if you can afford it that is. In which case, consider making it a goal for sooner than later. Anyway, I suggest a hearing test because if your hearing declines further, you aren’t necessarily going to notice until it starts being too much of a strain on you. It’s like dealing with pain, you want to stay ahead of it.

Sorry I don’t have any real advice for you, but I hope things get better. ❤️‍🩹🫂

Now, my hearing threshold is at 45-50db. I don't really feel it. Hyperacucis was really annoying and painful but it kind of eased off so at home I can play games or listen to music with no discomfort at all.
Because of that now the tinnitus has started to bother me more, it bothers me just because it's still there. It's a mild tinnitus, many people have it way worse but I still regret any decision that led to me losing hearing like this. 
Anyway, what do you think of the improvement? I initially thought it would stay as it was, but it better on its own.

Thank you for your responses! I’m seeing online earmuffs with Bluetooth. My hearing aids have Bluetooth already. Can I connect my headphones to the hearing aids? Any idea?

In what context? I can technically wear hearing protection earmuffs over my hearing aids with no issue but I don't because there's not really a point? Like I can't think of a situation where I would need the earmuffs but also want to hear people/where people with normal hearing would be expected to hear people. Are you thinking of something more like loops?

I’m not sure if this will work, but when I go to the shooting range, or when I’m doing yard work with gasoline power tools, I wear Peltor Electronic hearing protection. It is the over the ears style and it covers the behind the ear hearing aid as well, so you can use it while wearing your hearing aids. 

The earmuffs decrease the sound reaching the ear by 22db when operating in passive mode. In active mode, the electronics pass the sound through to the ear so that conversation, music and low db sounds can be heard. 

The earmuffs also have Bluetooth technology that allow your smartphone to be connected and passed through to your ears.

1oq1tki,HearingLoss,Hearing aid recommendation for profound hearing loss?,"I recently had my latest audiogram (dated 10/17/2025) and compared it with my old one from 2012. It looks like my hearing has gradually declined over the past 13 years. I have bilateral sensorineural hearing loss since birth. 

Back in 2012, my hearing was in the severe to severe–profound range, but my most recent test shows profound loss in both ears (around 100–120 dB HL across all frequencies) with no measurable speech recognition.

It was honestly upsetting… during the word test, my left ear only picked up a faint whooshing sound, and my right ear heard nothing at all. The last time I took that test years ago, I could at least identify some words.

The audiologist said this decline appears gradual and age-related, which makes sense based on my experience. Over the years, I relied more on my left ear as my right side started struggling (sometimes causing auditory overwhelm). Lately, though, my left hearing has been cutting out, and I used to assume it was my 13-year-old hearing aid acting up due to moisture… I’d air it out and it would work again. But now I’m wondering if it was actually my hearing declining rather than the device.

During my appointment, the audiologist tested an Oticon hearing aid (I’m not sure which model - it’s one made for severe to profound loss), but it didn’t help much. Everything still sounded faint, and all I could really make out was the whooshing sound.

She mentioned I’d be an excellent candidate for cochlear implants, though I’m hesitant since I feel the pros and cons are pretty mixed. She suggested trying the Phonak Naída L50-UP hearing aids first and recommended wearing both, even though my right ear currently has no usable hearing, explaining that there are still potential benefits to binaural use.

I just got fitted with the Phonak Naída hearing aids yesterday, and honestly, I’m really disappointed so far. I’m not getting any sound clarity… everything is extremely faint. I can hear some sounds, but they’re very, very quiet, almost like distant muffled noise.

It’s frustrating because my old hearing aids actually gave me much better sound clarity, even though they were over 13 years old. That’s making me wonder if what I assumed was the hearing aids failing might have actually been my hearing continuing to decline over time.

I do have a follow-up appointment in two weeks, so I’m hoping they can make some adjustments or at least explain what’s going on. I understand that I probably won’t regain speech understanding… I rely heavily on lip reading and environmental sounds… but right now, I feel like I’ve lost even the little bit of sound awareness I had before.

Has anyone here tried the Phonak Naída L50-UP (or the higher levels like L70 or L90) for profound loss? Did you notice any real difference in clarity or loudness?

I’d really appreciate any input or recommendations from others who have profound hearing loss. Have any of you found hearing aids that still give you useful sound awareness or clarity at this level of loss?

[댓글]
What age are you? I would inquire about CIs because you're at the point where HAs can't do all that much for speech comprehension, regardless of what model.

I agree that CI would likely be most effective, but typically Phonak is considered best i think

Thanks!

[댓글]
I find I have to regularly train my brain with sounds in order to ensure it can process it well - for that means I need to make it a point to be out in public in different environments that force me to ""exercise"" my hearing. I'll go for a meeting at a coffee shop with less than ideal acoustics and get lunch in places where I have to hold a conversation. I have to be quite focused during these times but I find if I don't do these regularly that my ability to process speech drops off (I have moderate-profound hearing loss).

I have severe hearing loss.  Meaning I struggle even with hearing aids. For phone, innocaption. Like iPhone has their own version.  But innocaption is really good and free. Of course texting is godsend. Asking for quieter areas of restaurants. Seating right next or directly across your partner. Seeing there lips of course really helps. Ask people to come closer when speaking to you. For going to movies. There have cc units that are available to use at your seat. For TV at home. Pair your aids or ipod to your tv

1oplf89,HearingLoss,Hope for SSNHL,"I wanted to share some good news and hope because I have almost fully recovered from sudden sensorineural hearing loss. When it first happened the internet felt really doom and gloom and hopeless so wanted to share my recovery story in case it helps anyone hold out hope for their hearing returning.

I woke up one day and suddenly couldn’t hear out of my left ear. I literally thought I had wax or something so I went to urgent care. The doctor started me on anti virals just in case and 60mg of prednisone for 10 days and an urgent referral to ENT. My first hearing test indicated severe loss and two weeks later I am almost back to normal. My MRI is clear so very likely idiopathic.

I credit my recovery to the following:
1. The urgent care doctor taking it seriously and acting FAST. Seek medical attention immediately and advocate for yourself. If you can’t get in, go to the ER. Your hearing is worth it. The Dr told me I had to pick up the prednisone that night and not to wait until the next day.
2. I received my first ear steroid injection on day 10. This helped tremendously. It is not comfortable but worth it and a few hours later you forget how painful it was.
3. By the time I was referred to hyperbaric oxygen therapy it was a little late and I no longer qualified due to improved hearing. I would explore this as soon as possible and not wait for a provider to recommend it.
4. I tackled this from every angle including eastern medicine and some “woo woo” stuff. Find a good acupuncturist immediately. There are a lot of meridians that can impact hearing. I also did some somatic work (look into the workout witch on instagram). I also repeated Louise Hay mantras and healing meditations. I know it sounds annoying but when the internet and doctors say it’s a low probability your hearing will return, it is important to remember healing is possible. It’s so hard and you don’t have to be perfect. I repeated to myself “I am safe, I am loved” every time I felt anxious.

No matter what you will be okay. It’s amazing how resilient humans. Day 1-3 I was SO disoriented. I couldn’t go into indoor places because the tinnitus was so bad. I thought all of my relationships would change. That my whole life experience would be different. A few days in I got used to it and knew it would be okay. My mindset shifted from “I will do anything to get my hearing back” to “I will do anything for a clear mri, I will figure out how to adapt to hearing loss.” It’s so hard and scary but there is hope. Not all stories end in permanent loss and even if you have permanent loss you will adapt to your new normal.

[댓글]
I appreciate your write up, I had nearly the same psychological ups and downs and treatments (although due to acoustic trauma). Probably the most difficult week of my life which I feel in your story too.

Insurance wouldn’t cover hyperbaric for me either for the same reason so I had to pay it out of pocket, didn’t help the tinnitus though.

Congratulations on your recovery. Your post is a good take, except acupuncture. Acupuncture has absolutely zero benefit in ssnhl. 

Act fast, start prednisolone early, take intratympanic injections in the first 7-10 days if no improvement, consider HBOT early. Also, valacyclovir, if diagnosed in the first 48 hours. 

These are evidence based recommendations. For ssnhl, acupuncture, meridians whatever are snake oil.",2025-11-06 01:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oplf89/hope_for_ssnhl/
1opjdf8,HearingLoss,Unbalanced hearing...??,"Hi! I'm not sure how to title this or explain this so I will try to be direct. Asking here was not my first option but I'm not getting answers so I apologize if this post doesn't qualify of being here. It's a long post so I hope you can read it fully.

So, my hearing has been good for all my life. After some events in 2022 involving CPTSD (diagnosed) one of my ears started ""sharpening"" my hearing sense, but the other kept on decreasing. I guess the hearing loss may be normal after I have to put music very loud to cancel the other sounds that affect my right ear, so I stopped putting it so loud.

I tried to go to my medics and all they did was compliment my right ear instead of. Actually doing something. I will explain. It hurts physically when I hear certain... Frequencies? Peaks of volume? I'm not sure at all. But it's not like I'm actually hearing anything, or that it hurts all the time. It's just with different noises (sometimes there's none, then it happens randomly), my right ear feels like it's getting pierced through my head and it hurts so much. It's enough to make me physically drop to the floor in pain. The people I live with think I'm being overdramatic but it hurts as much as period cramps.

As well it often goes silent and a static noise replaces the ""sharpened"" sense in the same ear, but it gets way more haunting because it makes me paranoid, unsure if there's actually something making that sound or if it's the ""static silence"". I must say here that my ear can also detect a buzzing sound from electronics even if they're far, so I hope that explains why the paranoia. It's very similar.

I don't know what should I do with this anymore, I'm worried, confused and desperate. One of my ears hears more than the other and it hurts, it's driving me mad. I hope I was able to explain everything and that it's clear that this started happening after 2022.

I try to deal with this but having one ear going from ""I'm so good at hearing that I can hear the neighbors"" to ""Could you repeat for the 13rd time please?"" Several times a day at mostly random times or with certain noise it's draining me completely...

Too me it sounds like you're hearing sounds that your brain isn't used to hearing.  Everyone who is new to hearing aids goes through an adjustment period.  Typically, our audiologist gradually increases our hearing until we reach our prescription target.

So, unfortunately for you this is your ""natural"" hearing.  My thought is that if we can decrease your hearing to a comfortable level and then gradually increase it, your brain would have time to adjust and you would perhaps enjoy your good hearing.

Can you buy OTC HAs that you are able to program yourself?  Perhaps the Apple Airpods 2?   Please check on them.  The weakness is the battery life is short.  But still a hearing break in an especially noisy listening environment would be a blessing.

Could you please check the recruitment phenomenon?",2025-11-05 23:47:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1opjdf8/unbalanced_hearing/

My hearing test today showed 25-40dB high-frequency hearing loss in my left ear. The audiologist said I should consider a hearing aid.

I have noticed I need to ask people to repeat themselves every once in a while when I'm not paying close attention but I still think my hearing is decent. I also don't know if my hearing will come back again. I'm feeling weird and conflicted about it and I'm sad that I'll probably need hearing aids eventually no matter what. I'm 34 years old.

Should I wait for my next appointment in 6 months?

I also experienced the same before and was crying, knowing that I didn't know how to react. Someone recommended me to try something and anything else, and then I saw this [https://www.jabees.com/products/audio-hearlink-bluetooth-microphone-transmitter](https://www.jabees.com/products/audio-hearlink-bluetooth-microphone-transmitter) and used it for a while. it doesn't go in your ear, and that's weird it just sends sound through bone conduction, so it felt safer for me to test out before going for hearing aids. It might be worth looking into while you wait for your next check-up.

It's entirely up to you. I have more hearing loss than you, and my audiologist said I didn't need them yet (but also that I could try them if I wanted to). My ENT specialists have all recommended against hearing aids at this point, with the opinion that avoiding using subtitles and practising keeping up the hearing I still have will protect from further hearing loss due to disuse / lack of practice. (There are lots of people in this subreddit that disagree with that advice and are likely to downvote the comments where I share the advice that I've been given.)

Since your hearing is still fluctuating, you may want to wait at this point to find out if your hearing will stabilize and what the long-term prognosis and potential treatment plan is for your specific condition. Or ask some follow-up questions, and to someone who's not just an audiologist.",2025-11-04 20:40:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ooinfx/should_i_get_hearing_aids/
1oofs5m,HearingLoss,Hearing Loss after Ear rupture,"Just posting this hear if anyone has any feedback or advice to give.

A little under a month ago I ruptured my ear drum (I was stupid and removing ear wax on my own)

According to an ENT I damaged (but not ruptured) my ear drum and damaged another part of my ear that resulted in fluids to come out. After about 3 weeks back and forth of hearing getting better and worse and fluids draining causing thumping in my ear, It seems my ear drum healed (I think that because when i swallow I don't get that crunchy noise, but not officially said by ENT).

Now, my ear has less intense beating (with some drainage while sleeping) and the last 3 days my hearing has been muffled, going to see my ENT again on 11/6/2025.

Just hope my hearing returns to normal

Update:

Went to see my ENT today. Says my ear has fully healed and once I told them I had hearing loss I took a hearing test.

They said while my ear drum had fully healed, there was some fluid build up behind it and I had to cover my nose and mouth and breath gently about 3-4 times a day.

They said my hearing would return to normal

Edit2: 

As of 11/13/2025 my hearing hasn't quite fully returned yet, but it has been slowly improving a little each day",2025-11-04 18:53:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oofs5m/hearing_loss_after_ear_rupture/

i would think you might be a candidate for an implant

Hey! Thanks for sharing this, it takes courage. 

  
Looking at your audiogram, it shows severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, especially in the higher frequencies. That definitely explains why noisy places like restaurants and airports feel really difficult, background noise overwhelms speech for your ears.

Since your current Signia 312NX hearing aids are 5+ years old, their power and technology may not be enough for your current hearing levels anymore. Hearing changes over time, so it’s okay that you feel the difference.

Hearing aid options for you:

Phonak Naida Paradise (P-UP / SP models)  
Great for severe profound loss + excellent Bluetooth + strong noise reduction

ReSound ENZO Q  
Designed specifically for people with profound loss, super powerful &amp; clear

Signia Motion Charge&amp;Go SP  
If you like Signia, rechargeable with strong power output

Oticon Xceed  
Really good for noisy environments and speech clarity

A re-evaluation with real-ear measurements + proper fitting will make a huge difference, too. And don’t worry, many people upgrade after 4-6 years because newer tech performs so much better.",2025-11-04 09:43:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oo38d4/i_need_some_advice/
1oo0rks,HearingLoss,Hearing Loss makes listening to music impossible,"It just sounds completely awfull, as if someone plays it through water and misconfigures the frequency bands additionally with hugely missing clarity and loudness. On the other hand making louder strains on my headphones and is very uncomfortable and harmfull and only improves the situation by little, and for that also only a short time because the hearing loss increases in an acute manner. It mostly returns after I quiet listening for some days but graduary increases a little on the long term. 

  
This is realy bad if music is important for well being. 

  
That said, sounds still annoy me, even more than without hearing loss. (Some people think it helps to have hearing loss hear but it doesnt actually)

[댓글]
I used to be like that but I tested airpods 3. I use it mainly for listening to music and calls now.

Putting the hearing up louder increases the volume in all frequencies.  You need to be more selective by using a graphic equalizer tuned to your hearing or hearing aids.

Edit-  better to follow this advice.  They seem to know more than I do. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/s/4Kb7K0RRGQ

I totally feel this. I have been dealing with hearing loss for the past month from a ruptured ear drum. My hearing has gone up and down over the process and the couple of times I tried listening to music it just did not sound right. I could hear the music but parts I remember hearing before were just not there. Very sad.

That sounds super frustrating. If music's important to you, it might help to get your hearing checked again and ask about a ""music"" setting that's less processed than the speech mode. Or you can adjust your source via EQ. That's what my uncle does, he has moderate hearing loss and uses audien hearing aids. It won't make everything perfect but it can help bring a lot of that richness back.",2025-11-04 06:58:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oo0rks/hearing_loss_makes_listening_to_music_impossible/
1ontyxz,HearingLoss,Parents won’t speak up,"Hi, I’m 34 years old and I was recently diagnosed with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss after having poor hearing for several years. My parents are both mumbling, turning away when they speak, or only voicing half of a sentence at normal volume. They are both fully capable of speaking normally and they speak to other people at a regular volume. Not me. If you’ve had this problem with family or friends, what helped? Did you get them to talk normally?

[댓글]
I'm 23 and have dealt with parents (particularly my dad) either refusing to speak up or straight up SHOUTING when I ask them to repeat themselves as if they don't realize there's a middle ground my whole life. It's beyond frustrating. I wish I could magically make them understand how hard it is for me

I’m so sorry this is happening. What if you just don’t respond to them if you can’t hear them clearly? Be polite or act oblivious, vs. complaining, but don’t respond and don’t ask them to repeat. If they want to communicate with you they will have to shift if you just won’t respond otherwise.

My son (age 16) resists speaking up. Saying it's a ""resistance"" is key - I think loved ones find it hard to accept that we're fallible. They want to pretend everything is fine, and can't accept that it isn't.


You said your diagnosis was recent. So, the acceptance takes time. When people don't want to accept reality, it's a slow process. 


But things can improve... Others can eventually be more understanding. It just means you have to push for it. I've had to constantly remind my kid for years that I won't hear quiet or distant talking. And things have gradually improved. Not enough and not quickly. 


Tldr: others may have emotional resistance to your hearing loss. With time that might improve.

Take them with you to see your audiologist. The audi can help them better understand what you're going through and how to best communicate with them.

If this isn't a viable option, walk them thru some literature from your audi (or on-line) on communicating with people with hearing loss.

The first of those two options will be much more effective, as long as your family members believe medical professionals know what they're talking about.

If they like movies, watch Sound of Metal. It will give them an idea of what you're going thru.

Lastly, this will take your reminding them of how to communicate with you. After decades, I still have to remind my spouse not to try and talk with me from another room.

my mom is like this too. i ask her over and over to repeat and she'll continue to mumble until the 3rd or 4th time when she'll get visibly angry and shout it at me. it's frustrating.. i've learned that if its not a request she is asking of me, to just nod and laugh depending on her face. i give generic answers until i figure it out on my own. why are they like thissss

I don’t think they’ll magically change. It’s infuriating. I’m sorry.

[댓글]
ENT here. First step is to see an audiologist and get a hearing test. If you are in a mild to moderate category, you can consider an over-the-counter device if you are somewhat tech savvy and a self starter. If not, or you have more than moderate hearing loss you definitely need a prescription device.  Good luck!

As others have said, you need a professional audiogram to even begin to understand what your losses are and what would help. If you're in a Costco country, that can be a very good place to start as they sell very teputable aids at a fraction of the cost of regular audiology offices, snd there's a 6 month trial period.

You need an audiogram first... Yes, they are expensive. They profit on people suffering. I have severe loss in my right ear. I tested a few and the single bet is on the high end stuff. Oh by the way. Do you know how much the chip of the top of the range Phonak hearing aids is costing when is going out the factory door? 35 Euro. They add some mics, some batteries and there you go: 4000 Euro for both ears. This is unacceptable. I don't recommend any cheap hearing aids. They are really toys. Keep in mind, the number of channels are very important. The more the better. Don't go under 14 channels no matter what.",2025-11-03 13:13:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1onbexw/new_to_the_hearing_aid_world_i_need_some_advice/

1on538y,HearingLoss,Is it possible to get an extended hearing test beyond the 8k hz mark?,"I say this because since January 2024 I have been losing my hearing. I’ve had two hearing tests one in June 2024 and another in October 2025 and they show my hearing is normal. But I can only hear up to 13k hz. I know those tests online aren’t reliable but I’m only 18 and music sounds so shallow and cars driving past and electrical hums are quieter. I’ve also had tinnitus since September/October 2022. 

[댓글]
The slice of the audible frequency range between 13k and 20k is TINY. It's not even a full octave. It's possible that you never heard much sound above 13k. 

If you have hearing within a normal range up to 8k then you should just accept that as a good thing and move on. You have absolutely nothing to gain by going down this rabbit hole.

Speaking as a former full time / professional audio engineer and musician: you should be much more concerned about below 250hz. Even 125hz, which some places test, isn’t all that low. There is not much useful information above 8k.

I would assume it's not a matter of how high you can hear, but rather that your entire high frequency hearing or a region in the treble is recessed. I have complete loss of everything above 10KHz in my left ear, but things can sound bright and clear still.

Doctor of audiology here: testing the extended HF thresholds is becoming a serious consideration due to the role of HF in various supra threshold auditory abilities and the relationship between HF thresholds and hidden hearing loss / cochlear synaptopathy. I am testing my patients if they report reduced speech perception in noise and tinnitus even with normal hearing thresholds in routinely tested frequencies. 
Btw online tests are more unreliable for extended HF since calibration is trickier. So it is better to get tested in a proper clinic

Try this app. At least with one of my older smartphone (with analog headphone jack) it surprisingly match a real calibrated audio test. If you have a real audio test, do the test immediately after and compare at least the tested frequencies. If you know someone with perfect hearting (preferably in his late teens or early twenties) ask him/her to calibrate it.

Always use the same smartphone and the same buds to do the test.

1omrcko,HearingLoss,Improvement in my hearing (NIHL),"So I am kind of awestruck due to what happened recently ,so let me begin from the start.

I am 20 y/o ,I loved listening to music eith my earphones ,I would use my earphones at very loud volumes very frequently for longer periods of time ,I had no idea that this could cause noise induced hearing loss or whatsoever. And I never felt aby problem with my ears.

Around 2 months ago I had to take a full body medicals due to my profession and I happened to discover I have noise induced hearing loss when I further tested at a different lab it showed that I had  moderately severe noise induced hearing loss (attached results) I had no idea about all these things after some research I realised that the damage done was a lot and the only reason for it was my long term use of earphones, I started to regret all of my life choices and felt very low. Also I would like to mention that I have never felt any hearing loss in my day to day life even as of now ,I can hear everything well and fine so even though the audiogram shows such a loss am still having a good hearing in day to day life and never felt any issues ,except for the occasional tinnitus which doesn't really bother me cause I learned  to just not focus on it and it goes away.

 After 10 days I went to a ENT specialist for their help regarding my hearing ,they made me take the audiometry test again (results attached) .This time the graph was slightly better very slightly ,the reason for this was during my first test I was very tensed and my heartbeat was very high so it put me under a lot of pressure so I couldn't hear the beep correctly. So now it's still moderately severe, my docter suggests me some tablets in which throughout most of the course it was a vitamin tablet ,she said am still young there are some chances of recovery,she said me to recheck after 4 weeks .

So fast forward to now ,after approx 1.5 months I went back to the docter without any hopes for improvement, but once I took the test again there was s very good amount of improvement (attached results), which was unbelievable to me because I had no more hopes of any recovery since my earphones usage was a longterm damage .after my 2nd audiometry test ,along with my medicines I completely stopped using my earphones which was the main culprit and I bought a earplugs to use in very loud places ,and by taking these precautions there have been a good amount of recovery. The docter has suggested me another 15 vitamin tablets to take alternatively for the next 30 days ,she said me that we can't hope for much better results from this current one but we can hope a slight improvement. So now am just hoping and praying  that I can get even slightly some more improvement in my audiogram .

Thank you for reading my story.

Glad you are improving. What exactly are the supplements are you taking?

Glad you're being proactive about it! I don't want to be a downer but true NIHL usually doesn't ""recover"" the way other things might. My uncle's audiologist explained that once those hair cells are damaged, you can't grow really them back, but you can certainly make your hearing experience better. He's now using hearing aids (audien ion pro) and swears they make speech and daily stuff so much clearer. Vitamins can't hurt but yeah, stopping the damage and protecting what you have is what really matters long-term.

am not a doctor. But I know that loud hearing induces a temporary hearing loss that recover in a few hours. Have you used your headphones shortly before one of the test? That could explain the improvement.

But honestly the 3 charts doesn't differ that much.

You don't necessarily conciensly notice a problem. The difference could be notice if you participate in a social event with many people talking. You may notice that don't hear what are said as easily as others.

But stop using hour headphones. Your tests are not catastrophic but not stellar, especially for someone in his '20.  I have slight/moderate hearing loss but I am 54. Still I am a little over you in my right ear.

A persistent tintinus usually means hearting loss. Once you have it, you obviously better ignore it but this is not something to be dismissed.

As a hearing instrument specialist, I test ears for a living. First thing I noticed from the Sept 5th test was the clinician didn’t mask (important to determine if inner ear vs outer ear hearing loss) at 4kHz. You have to mask when the BC [bone conduction] (&lt;&gt; symbols) is more than 15dB higher than AC [air conduction] (xo symbols). Because the didn’t mask, that test doesn’t actually determine if the hearing loss is permanent or not. Inner ear hearing loss is most commonly permanent, outer ear hearing loss (conductive) is most likely treatable. The clinician also didn’t do BC at 3kHz which would be really important to determine if the AC results are as severe as they seem. I would say the first test was definitely not an accurate test. 

As for the second two tests, the BC score was within 15dB to the AC score so it does show that there’s an inner ear loss which is more worrisome. However the second clinician still didn’t test 3kHz BC which I’d love to see to make sure the result is 100% inner ear. 

I’m glad the results are improving every time but I’m still shocked there’s improvement solely due to the supplements and stopping noise exposure. I’ve never heard of supplements improving SNHL (inner ear) unless someone had a viral ear infection or had been taking ototoxic medication.",2025-11-02 20:05:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1omrcko/improvement_in_my_hearing_nihl/
1omlfnr,HearingLoss,Brain compensating for the hearing loss in the other ear?,"I had a weird yet beautiful surprise in the last 2 moths or so. My left ear always had a normal bass level in audiogram. Around 20dB loss (within normal range) at 125Hz, 250hz etc... I lost my bass and middle frequencies in the right ear on 7 March 2025. In all this this time also the left one was so so but withing limits. Since August though I noticed a booomy powerfull bass in my left ear. I took two consecutive audiograms 1 month appart. Same place, same equipment same conditions. I noticed my 125hz was with 5dB over what's considered 0dB (upper human normal hearing) and the 250hz and 500Hz stand strong at 0dB. I'm not complaining. I never had such bass even when I was younger. Now I'm almost 45, but I wonder how is that possible? Anybody else experienced this? Man that bass kick ass. I watch movies with my g.f. and sometimes I go: ""woooow baby this sound will brake my bones"" and she's like: ""whaaat? dude.. is just a regular bass"".

1oma134,HearingLoss,Ent told me I could have otosclorosis currently undiagnosed,"This is really a vent and seeking some advice. Hey all I’m 34, I’ve been somewhat struggling with the thought of otosclorosis and thinking I could lose hearing in both of my ears. Currently I have mild hearing loss in left ear that I’ve noticed for 3 months in the last month tinnitus has been present and distracting/ annoying. 
I was put on a a steroid to rule out other causes but coming to the end of the medication and no change. 

I’ll have one more hearing test to see if carharts notch is detected as it wasn’t in the last test.. perhaps it’s too early to see. Then I’ll see my ent where I’m assuming I’ll get the diagnosis with otosclerosis. He said this condition can be a genetic condition but I haven’t heard of anyone in my family having it.. 

After my last ent visit I was pretty upset thinking my hearing will get so bad in my left ear and reading that it eventually affect the other ear. I’m thankful for solutions like hearing aid and the possibility of surgery but I’m also scared that, that’s what it could come too. 
If I’m able too with mild hearing loss I’m considering a hearing aid for my left ear if it can help with tinnitus and of course improve hearing.

It can be frightening initially to get a diagnosis. It's important to rule out other causes first and/or other contributors exacerbating your symptoms.  For myself, I had a lot of anxiety surrounding my diagnosis, however, in time it lessened and became something I accepted. I would recommend continuing to follow up with your doctor, understand all your options, and be gentle with yourself. Stay well.

I have otosclerosis and the gradual decline in hearing has been a challenge, but hearing aids help a lot with it and the tinnitus. It has been associated with genetics, autoimmune diseases, and pregnancy hormones. I think mine is a combination of all three but it really was noticeable after my second pregnancy.

If you’re diagnosed with it, a stapedectomy is an option, but I’ve not yet gone back to a surgeon to discuss. Six years ago with moderate hearing loss, I didn’t qualify. I now have moderate severe loss and would likely qualify. 

There is a great group on Facebook to discuss others experiences with their stapedectomy (both or one ear), recovery, and more, but definitely invest in hearing aids early. I waited too long.

I have advanced otosclerosis. Find a great ENT and do annual visits. My hearing loss is severe -profound and I've been a hearing aid wearer since 7th grade. Aids make a profound difference. I had a stapedectomy in high school and it helped keep one ear in the moderate level for many many years. Never did the left ear and eventually may get a CI because otosclerosis is so advanced in that ear. 

My ENT ordered an MRI to better understand that stage of otosclerosis which was helpful. Everyone's journey is different but the best advice I can give is annual hearing tests, hearing aid adjustments and finding a great ENT you trust and just go along for the ride as the technology keeps improving.

I was diagnosed at 37. I think it probably often goes undiagnosed because it either isn't severe enough or people just think hearing changes are normal with age. I went about 10 years without seeking a diagnosis - finances were a part of that decision.


I now use a hearing aide for my left ear only and only in certain environments. Even if you don't need it to hear, I do think it's important to stimulate your brain with sound from both ears if possible.


Sometimes I'm even glad for my hearing loss in one ear (like when my partner snores and I can turn over onto my good ear and not hear anything...haha.)


It can be scary to get the diagnosis but at least then you can move forward with potential options or at least peace of mind.",2025-11-02 06:12:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oma134/ent_told_me_i_could_have_otosclorosis_currently/

There’s a whole community out here waiting to welcome you OP.

I remember being really upset at first but I promise over time, it’s become something I would never change about myself. Give yourself time and grace to accept you and we’ll accept you too❤️

That's a frustrating level of loss.

When you do get fitted, just be aware that the first few days will be rough.  Your brain will probably have a hard time reacting to hearing a whole lot of sounds when it has become used to quiet.  

You may want to spend more time in a quiet environment, you may just want to prepare yourself mentally for what may be a little anxiety or stress inducing or maybe even cause headaches.  This is normal, and it should pass within a few days.  I think it's better to be warned than find out the hard way.  Stick with it!

Good luck!

Sorry to hear that. I myself have been in your situation when I first found out that I also have hearing loss. 

I believe that tinnitus is also related to stress. So try to reduce stress if you could.  I used to work in a very stressful environment but after I changed job it was so much better. I just have the ringing in my ears rarely. Mostly when I am very tired or when I hear a very loud sound.

As for wearing hearing aid. It helps a lot!!! But...

It just helps if you have the right fitting. I used to hate wearing them initially because It does not help me at all(not helping with hearing things). My first audiologist just dismissed my opinion about them and told me that I need to get used to it. I really did not like that hearing aid at all.

Years later...I have decided to go to a different audiologist and change hearing aid too.This audiologist made the right fitting and I was very surprised by the changes! After this experience I communicated things I am having a hard time with when using them and my audiologist would adjust them. This is where it has helped in my life a lot. I am a proud hearing aid user for 8+ years already. 

So I Iearned that as a patient we need to find the right audiologist for us as well. Hearing aid won't stop our hearing loss but it can delay it. So far my latest hearing result is somewhat just a bit higher than previous. I use to have mild-moderate hearing loss.Now its in moderately severe.

I pray that you get over this. I myself use to be very afraid too when I found out about my hearing loss but having a supportive people around me has helped. They assured me that its normal or that its not a problem since I am still able to communicate and that is good. 🥹

might be experiencing something called diplacusis it’s when the ears perceive the same sound at slightly different pitches.
It can happen after an ear infection, fluid buildup, or hearing loss.
Basically, your brain is getting mismatched frequency information from both ears,
It’s not usually permanent, but it’s really important to see an ENT.

If you hear ringing on one of your ears constantly, you might have tinnitus which cannot be healed, i got this on the internet",2025-11-01 18:46:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1olvmxq/all_sounds_are_lower_pitched_now/
1olvljk,HearingLoss,Hearing loss in 3 month old - conflicting ABRs,"Hi!  Hoping to get this group’s thoughts on the current situation with my almost 3 month old son.  He failed his newborn hearing screen in August.  At a September ABR, he was diagnosed with bilateral mild sensorineural hearing loss (30 db @ 4k hz).  The audiologist explained it was permanent etc.  They did a bone conduction test that showed pretty wonky results (45 db @ 4k), so they said there was no fluid but also said those results are probably wrong because the headset didn't fit the baby well and to kind of ignore it.  The hospital's protocol is to do another ABR 6 weeks later and meet with the pediatric ENT.  We did that last week and his ABR was normal/borderline normal (see attached - 20 db @ 4k).  My head is spinning!  I spent the last 6 weeks processing the news about the permanent hearing loss, expecting progression, and figuring out next steps and resources for him and now this.  The ENT said we shouldn't completely ignore the first ABR so we'll do another test and keep monitoring, but that this is a really ""good spot.""

Does anyone have any advice on how to reconcile these two ABRs?  We have a third ABR scheduled for early December.  Are there any questions I should ask the audiologist and ENT to rule out things?

I've attached both ABRs, if that's helpful.  We live in a major city and these were done at a major children's hospital.

Thank you so much!

Not sure if this is helpful at all but hearing loss can sometimes fluctuate so the ENT saying to have another one, I guess you're just in waiting mode.

im not an AuD but these two reports do not seem to have meaningful differences. ABRs are not exact, and even regular audiograms have a 5-10db margin of error",2025-11-01 18:45:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1olvljk/hearing_loss_in_3_month_old_conflicting_abrs/

1oksl0u,HearingLoss,Looking for Encouragement (Terrified of Intratympanic Steroid Injection),"Today, for the first time, I may have an intratympanic steroid injection, and I’m honestly terrified. So anxious and afraid of the pain and the vertigo. Does anyone have any strength, hope, advice or recommendations to share. I’m just feeling beside myself. 

I have autoimmune inner ear disease and have been losing my hearing progressively for 30 years now — some times gradually, sometimes in significant decreases. Three weeks ago I had yet another significant decrease in my only ear with any hearing — significant enough that my world went silent overnight. I’ve now been on high-dose steroid therapy for three weeks with only a modicum of improvement (hearing still unable to be improved with assistive listening devises and hearing aids). In my fourth follow-up appointment since the event, we’re expected to discuss whether or not the intratympanic injection may be the next best step. I trust my hearing specialist and will follow her medical advice. But I’m just shaking in my boots scared. (My younger brother also has AIED and has had a couple of the shots. He said the initial numbing shot really, really hurt and that the steroid shot was painless but caused him to have considerable vertigo. UGH!! 😩) 

[댓글]
I have had the steroid shot twice. It definitely wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The anesthetic stung a little but the shot itself was painless although I did feel my ear filling up. I didn't experience any vertigo. 
Good luck. I don't think it is going to be as bad as you are thinking.

Do the injection!! It's not a comfortable procedure, but honestly, we can handle discomfort easily. It's not a big deal. I had 4 shots total, and am glad I did them as I started to get some hearing back from them. Don't overthink it, it's definitely worth it. Think of it as a mild discomfort for potential hearing gains - it's a no brainer! You've got this.

I had four of them, and it was easy... They use drops to numb the ear, and that does make you a bit dizzy for a few minutes, they then warmed   up the fluid so the injection wasn't so cold. There really was no pain, you do feel the ear fill up, and a metallic taste, but it doesn't last very long. Then they had me just wait for 30 minutes and it was over. I did regain a little bit of my hearing, but not much, but anything is better than nothing. Good luck with yours.

It's literally one of the most common things the ENT doctors do all the time. No, it's not painful and no it doesn't cause vertigo every time.",2025-10-31 11:58:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oksl0u/looking_for_encouragement_terrified_of/

1ok3um1,HearingLoss,Panic attack after micro suction? Is this actually ok?,"My ent had to suction out my left ear due to it being blocked. I saw what came out and was like holy crap. 2 huge black dmn near balls that idk how even seemed to fit out if there. But ive read horror stories and almost told her no dont do it. Ill live with the blockage. Im now in a panic attack. Ive heard horror stories of it making hearing worse, or making your tinnitus worse, i asked her and she said it can temporarily cause issues like tinnitus spikes or dizzyness from the suction sensation but goes away.  But now in terrified and regret it as i feel alittle off afterwards. 

[댓글]
Your ENT is right. The removal of a significant blockage can lead to temporary tinnitus because you've been depriving yourself of stimulation, sound, leading to your brain being surprised at the sudden input. That temporary sensitivity can cause some degree of dizziness.

Your story is a bit hard to follow. Did you fully clear the blockage, or did you stop mid-way? Did you get any clue as to what the ""black balls"" were? What are you regretting? I'm not sure why you would want to sacrifice hearing properly for such a small procedure with temporary, minor side effects. Microsuction, by an ENT, is very safe.

[deleted]

How did you find it out ? I constantly feel that there is a blockage on my ears, when I ask to the doctor look, she just do it superficial, and says there is nothing, but I feel it does have something in there

A little disorientation is normal- a blockage like that was probably causing you balancing issues that you'd subconsciously adapted to, and now your body is trying to recalibrate without that in the way. Your brain has also probabky gotten used to less sensory input coming from that ear with a blockage that bad (sounds like inpacted earwax to me but idk), so it will need tome to adjust to that as well. If it lasts longer than a couple days to a week, though, then a trip to urgent care couldn't hurt if you have an affordable one near you. I don't want to sound callous in saying this, but panicking won't help either. Try to keep your mind occupied doing things you enjoy, spending time with friends and family, getting your favorite sweet treat, whatever will take your focus off of how weird you feel.

See a therapist, your issue is not hearing loss.",2025-10-30 16:08:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ok3um1/panic_attack_after_micro_suction_is_this_actually/

It is next to impossible ..!!
Still who knows some mircale could happen..
Till thn protect what you have..!!
But for now,we can only hope!!

I'm  optimistic as there have been promising stem cell trials done to regenerate  hair growth.

There’s promising treatments I’ve read about, but they’re closer to 20-40 years out.

Similar posts were made 10 years ago.
The answer unfortunately is still no.
I used to read up new advancements in ear treatments only for them all to prove failures.

I think it’s better to not to follow this stuff for peace of mind.
If it does eventually become a reality it will be so huge it will be covered in the regular news.

Eventually, I'm sure. But 5-10 years sounds maybe a little lofty to me

In my opinion, yes. People really underestimate the improvements in technology and science and think they things will stay the same pace as it’s been. This is not true. Especially with continuous improvements in AI, development and research in gene/stem cell therapy will accelerate at a rate much faster than the past 10 years. I’m very certain that at least by 2035, there will be some sort of hearing regeneration treatment, at least proven to work effectively in trials. Next year, keep an eye out for cil-001 and rincell-1 and their results. (They are for auditory neuropathy and cochlear synaptopathy)

I'm of two minds on this.

On the one hand, it remains the fact that differentiation of supporting cells to hair cells has not been achieved yet. Organoids could be instrumental in achieving that step but it's not really a sure thing. Perhaps they can iterate more rapidly with organoids, which are getting more bioequivalent.

On the other hand, so much knowledge has been accumulated with some recent discoveries that could be truly groundbreaking. In the obituary of Dr. Hudspeth, there is mention of some treatment that Rockefeller University has optioned. Sadly no info on how effective that is or at what stage of development. That could be the TRULI molecule or the derivative they have been working on for many years - which only solve the replication of supporting cells to some extent - or it could be something much further along, but we do not know. 

Also important to note is that until recently scientists have had no way of observing the cochlea in humans - except post mortem. There are recent developments such as maintaining cochlea alive outside the body, organoids (again) and development of new imaging technology such as more advanced OCT such that treatments can be developed and evaluated more rapidly.

Overall, who knows. Perhaps we'll have treatment in the next few years or it will remain a pipe dream for many years to come. My understanding is that ears and hearing are some of the most difficult parts of the human body to address. Most anything else can already be transplanted. Innovation may allow for lab grown replacements or in situ regeneration but I doubt either can be achieved for ears before other organs.

Ending on a depressing note, sorry about that.

Another issue is that hearing loss has other consequences such as recruitment and tinnitus which may not necessarily be reversible with regeneration of hair cells.

I would have very little difficulty living with the level of hearing loss I have suffered except for those two issues that are really bothering me.

It would be a huge letdown if any treatment would only be effective if applied very soon after hearing loss occurs before what I consider maladaptive responses mostly by the brain.

No, unfortunately. It's an extremely complex topic.",2025-10-30 07:11:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ojt1hl/is_it_promising_that_we_will_be_able_to_revive/

[댓글]
If you don't taper you are asking for trouble

oh and yes, this is for a blocked right crustacean tube and mild hearing loss

Not a doctor, but a frequent prednisone patient. Prednisone is best taken with food, and I believe the advice is generally to take the pills three times a day (so roughly 8 hours apart). You could do an early breakfast, midday lunch, and then a late before bed snack. I wouldn’t advise taking a full day’s dosage all at once, though. Doing so would be hard on your stomach and would reduce the therapeutic benefit throughout the day.

you can take half in the morning with a meal and the other half in the evening with a meal.  You should have the same outcome.

Contact your pharmacy. Usually, you're going to take one dose every morning with food, once a day. If they said to start with 4 pills a day, you would eat breakfast, take 4 pills with water, and be done for the day.

In other words, for X number of days, you take Y number of pills in the morning with food. After that many days, you decrease the dose to Z number of pills (in the morning with food). And repeat. Instructions should be on the label or accompanying paperwork.

When it says take 4 a day, take 4 in the morning.",2025-10-29 22:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ojj1t7/prednisone_taper/

Your hearing is within normal range with no meaningful change between the two audiograms.

there is no hearing loss nor real changes on either audiogram

&gt;My question is why has hearing been getting worse since January 2024 no matter how much noise prevention I take?

That is the million dollar question. 

Besides the obvious sound-induced hearing loss, I see more reports suggesting viral infections are causing hearing loss. ([Here ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4222184/)is one example.) Unfortunately, people sometimes don't know they've contracted the virus until it's too late.

I've personally noticed that sinus/ear infections have dinged my hearing, so I am assertive about taking Emergen-C, etc. when I feel something coming on.

The change is negligible. You wouldn't even notice such a miniscule drop on an audiogram

Those tests means nothing! You don’t have the necessary equipment! Also I want to ask you how loud you should turn up the volume? One device is louder other less loud at maximum volume and so on. You need special headphones used for measuring this stuff and calibrated sound generators. I mean when I test if you hear 1 kHz at 5dB then I must be damn sure about the level that reaches your ear when testing and that’s impossible! If you have an iPhone your safest bet is Mimi app! However when testing low frequencies is off by much! I have low and middle hearing loss in my right ear and while the official audiogram is showing a medium loss of 33dB, the Mimi app shows just 20dB! So you can’t trust that either. However for you at home is the safest bet to do a fast check.

Do not do those tests, they are vaguely helpful at best and incredibly dangerous at worse, especially for extended periods of time and high frequencies. Similar to whats already said, your best bet is to get your hearing properly tested at an audiologist.

1oh0r63,HearingLoss,"What to expect, 2yo sedated ABR test","Hi all,

My son (2 years old) has a speech delay, a history of frequent ear infections, ear tubes that fell out after 4 and 7 months, and two inconclusive hearing tests. The first one was done back in March and the second was done in July. The audiologist could not determine if his first results were due to fluid buildup from a cold or not, or whether his second results were due to him not hearing vs ignoring them. Toddlers!

After the second failed test, his ENT recommended a sedated ABR test. It's later this week (provided he doesn't get another respiratory infection... we already had to postpone once). We haven't gotten much information in advance about what to expect. My questions for this sub are:

- If your child had a similar trajectory, was the ABR conclusive?
- Did you get results immediately, or did they take some time to process?
- If the test wasn't conclusive, what did you do next?
- Anything you'd recommend we ask the doctor/nursing staff when we get to the hospital?

Thanks so much!

Make sure you understand the difference between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. The ABR will first try an air conduction test and if hearing loss is present, will try a bone conduction test to bypass middle ear and test for potential sensorineural hearing loss.

Results should be immediate. If it’s conductive loss it’s typically correctable.

My son has had multiple ABRs with varying results as his ear fluid reduces over time. The results have been improving each ABR. 

Also, some babies are delayed in speech for no real reason. My mom always says I didn’t say much until I was 3 and then I started talking out of nowhere.

Best of luck on the ABR.

Ask how they monitor breathing during sedation and whether you’ll be allowed in the room before and right after the test  every hospital has slightly different policies. Bring comfort items (blanket, stuffed toy) and plan for some grogginess afterward.

my niece went through almost the exact same thing around that age. The sedated ABR sounds scarier than it actually is. It’s basically a way for them to get super accurate results while your little one is totally still (since movement can mess up the test). The sedation is light, and most kids bounce back pretty quickly afterward just a bit groggy for a few hours.",2025-10-27 00:37:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oh0r63/what_to_expect_2yo_sedated_abr_test/
1ogpb2n,HearingLoss,How is my hearing?,"So, for context, I had a cracker bursting near my ear in 2023, I was 12 years old at that time and currently I am 14. The first audiogram is from 2023, and the second one is just from a few days ago. I know it has improved a lot, but I recently exposed myself to some headphones. I had been told not to, and it has caused some tinnitus. The thing which is going on in my head right now, is that will there be a time when I can listen to loud music and go clubbing without worrying about my ear. Also, when I close my left ear, I hear a muffled sound from my right ear.

Use earplugs if you want to go to concerts and clubs, they throw a huge punch, there are already headphones that reduce the dB without altering the sound quality

When did you see the improvement after first hearing test??

Protect your ears and avoid further damage to them.

Still near normal. I'd not f around with anything that might remotely damage my hearing, if I were you.

There will and there should never be a time you can go to clubbing and expose yourself to unnecessarily loud music, frankly, no one should do that.

1ogp7fy,HearingLoss,"Hearing loss as a child, now a mechanic","Looking for help for our youngest who was diagnosed with hearing loss at approximately 6 yo. He is now 23. He used hearing aids when younger but refused to wear them once he hit middle school

I had his ENT and audiologist records, but failed to print or download them due to moving. He did request an updated link for those records last week. I recall that he had both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. His first audiologist reproduced the way he heard things on the computer, it sounded like he was listening to a conversation, but was underwater. He struggled with soft sounds, he always said ice cream come (a la home) instead of cone. 

His hearing loss has progressed substantially in the last ~5 years. He finally agreed to allow us to help him see an audiologist and see if there are any HAs that may assist him. At the time of dx we were unable to have the labs that would determine if this was genetic, I do have an uncle with profound hearing loss and recently received a CI. 

I fully understand he will have to be evaluated again before any definitive answers can be received (waiting on those records), but I’m curious if any of you are a mechanic and use HAs while working, what are your pros and cons?

Thank you, any insight is appreciated, any particular questions we should ask the audiologist, etc. i’m so worried about this kid’s world narrowing into a pinpoint, developing dementia due to hearing loss, etc.

Absolutely worth going to an audiologist to get a test done. If he had hearing aids at some point he should absolutely continue to wear them, but given the time frame they'll definitely need to be adjusted by an audiologist after getting the test done.

diagnosed with what? your hearing is within normal range

You still have normal hearing according to this audiogram, I would seek a second opinion regarding your diagnosis.

Just a voice of reason, it is very possible your ENT was correct idk why people are doubting that. That said, you do not YET have hearing loss if you ever do, so the otosclerosis sub you originally posted it in is more appropriate than this group.

Just of curiosity, how old are you? If you are in your early '20, you might be considered a little borderline in some frequencies (normal is &lt; 20). As other have said, this is not hearring loss. If your ENT said it, please have a second opinion. Caveat: I am not a doctor.",2025-10-25 22:26:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1og4hiq/newly_diagnosed/

i found out about my hearing loss last november (2024) and had a one year retest this past monday as i felt i as starting to struggle again even with my hearing aids. my hearing dropped again in the past year to where it is now (in my audiogram. both are included so before and after is shown). i don’t know what to do. we only did pure tones this time and then an adjustment to my settings. i started last year with philips 9050 RIC BTEs but switched to jabra power BTEs in april because i felt i wasn’t getting enough clarity. i noticed a change right away but now that i’m used to them, i don’t feel that i’m getting speech clarity at all. everything is loud (not painfully loud. everything is just louder like every noise is louder not just speech. the volume is not a prob, it doesn't bug me but i need voices) and oh my god does it make a difference vs when i don’t have them in at all… but that’s just it. everything is louder but i still need to ask people to repeat all the time. 

my boyfriend is usually my passenger and so he sits on my right which is my worse ear. i struggle sooo much to hear him and its the worst when he’s on one side of me (and even worse when that one side is my right!). i feel the change in my hearing aids now after my retest but i’m still struggling. even in situations where i’ve been talking to my lab partners in a quiet hall, i miss a lot of what they say. everyone mumbles!! every environmental noise is so loud and there’s so many?! i’m not sure what to do. my grandma suggested CI evaluation but i think only because she has no idea a) how much that costs b) what it is and c) the qualifications.(we call her dr gma name because she always suggests medical procedures or diagnoses that she has no idea about lol. she just wants to help of course!) i don’t know if i’d even qualify but i need some sort of solution. would this be an option? 

i’m pre-nursing and now an EMT and soon to be in nursing school. i still feel isolated. i still feel like i’m a bit held back. thankfully in my classes, i really only have 1 that’s requiring me to hear everything. but that 1 is a major requirement and a HUGE class for me. my EMT class was extremely difficult because i was missing so much dialogue all the time but they were able to help me a bit since i was open about my situation. 

i’ve been using ASL with my boyfriend everyday now that he’s learning especially in public, which has been a wonderful way to be able to communicate, but my family doesn’t treat me like i have hearing loss at all so it’s difficult. i get yelled at a lot for not doing chores my mom mumble-asked me and i totally missed. 

i’m unsure what the next step should be. i’m worried my hearing will continue to deteriorate and that i won’t be able to find a solution that works for me

\* yes i understand that i am not particularly CI candidate material. i had looked up how to get more engagement thru titles and so the title is the way it is so i am able to lure people in for opinions :) doesn't hurt to ask either, tho! \*

You might need to go back for adjustments. Make sure you cleaning and maintaining them correctly, that can also make a huge difference. 

You only have mild to moderate hearing loss. A cochlear implant is normally approached with someone who has severe hearing loss. But this audiogram doesn't show word recognition, and that is another key to the puzzle.

Edit: I'm so sorry, I just realized the second picture and then reread what you wrote... do you have what your word recognition is for the second test?

Let me first say, that's such an awful situation feeling like you're held back because of your hearing. I know exactly what you are talking about. I really hope you get the issue resolved in time for your important class.

As others have said, your hearing loss based on the audiograms is not so bad that you would need CIs. There are numerous HAs that should help. So, it's either that

* you have the wrong HAs
* you have the correct HAs, they're just not adjusted/fitted properly
* there is something else going on (e.g. bone conduction issues)

You didn't say where you are getting your hearing tests done and the qualifications of the person(s) conducting the tests. A half decent audiologist combined with an ENT should be able to determine what solutions will work best for you.

definitely not a CI candidate

As others have said, not a CI candidate. Audiologists look for a pure tone average of 60 dB or worse at 500, 1k, 2k, and 4k Hz. 

Ask your audiologist for word recognition testing and SII (speech intelligibility index) technology. That should help them reprogram the hearing aid better. What type of hearing aid do you have? 

If you still don’t see improvement after their adjustments, maybe try another audiologist. IMO this level of loss shouldn’t be terribly difficult to get decent results from a hearing aid. 

Do you have a mini mic? It’s a device that someone can wear and its microphone picks up their speech and transmits it into your hearing aids. Super helpful for situations where there is a lot of background noise.

Depending on the type of hearing loss, you might qualify for BAHA

Likely not a CI candidate depending on word recognition. Do you have a mold on your hearing aids? I'd follow up with your clinician to see if they can make any adjustment

What is your word recognition score? You need to know that before jumping in to a CI. Also maybe you need to move up from Costco and try a different place because as a power user, with your latest tests, you should have seen an improvement but if not, then you need to go to another provider since the Costco one is failing you.

That’s the worst part, when you can hear the sound but not actually understand what people are saying. Have you had a word recognition test done lately? Sometimes the issue isn’t just volume but how your brain is processing speech frequencies.",2025-10-25 22:02:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1og3ynn/my_has_arent_cutting_it_anymore_could_i_qualify/

I don’t think anyone can really tell you anything without (a) being a doctor and (2) looking at the CT scan and hearing test results.

My son had a CT scan for hearing loss so I have some experience here. Yes the only info you should be listening to is from your son’s doctor but I understand being concerned and wanting to understand what the results could mean. 

It sounds like EVA which is an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. This can be a stand alone finding or part of Pendred Syndrome. Your son’s doctor might suggest genetic testing.

Going to be honest, never heard of it and I’m not a Dr.

&gt;any advice for the tinnitus?

The more you're bothered by it the more you're going to hear it. Accept it, ignore it and carry on with your life. Just make sure it's not a symptom of a medical condition.

Bilateral sudden hearing loss is very rare, did you take any ototoxic medication, or recently had a covid episode?

masking sounds can help a lot, though it's hard to recommend something specific without knowing exactly what frequency range your tinnitus is in. experiment with different things and see if any of them work for you. just search youtube for tinnitus masking sounds and chuck em on low when it gets bad. there's also the Widex app that's got some good looping ones for your phone.

personally this vid works wonders for me, no guarantees it'll do anything for you though [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq8KQkrgkxU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq8KQkrgkxU) (my tinnitus is quite high pitched)

Online tests, in my case, always told me I have mild to moderate hearing loss across all frequencies.

The other day I had an audiogram, and my hearing is normal across all frequencies (many within the 5 and 10 dB range, so nowhere near hearing loss).

I honestly wouldn't trust online tests too much, at least based on my experience.

""Is it common that people don’t even notice hearing loss that much?"" Absolutely.

Online tests are very inaccurate, very vulnerable to uncontrollable environmental factors. Can't hurt at all to go get a professional test done.

Since you’re a musician and already tuned into subtle changes, it’s more likely the stuffiness is from something like mild congestion, fluid, or Eustachian tube issues not a sudden moderate loss in both ears. Still if it’s been lingering for more than a week or two, it’s worth getting a proper audiogram done. That’ll give you an accurate baseline and help rule out anything more serious.

How did your severe hyperacusis change to mild?

You are a musician and you can trust an online test? I mean I’m a producer and I can tell you they mean nothing! You know what a dB is right? You are a musician! For measuring hearing loss they use pure sine waves at different levels and frequencies! You need calibration equipment to test that! Your usual headphones no matter how good are not flat! I have gear as Beyerdinamic and Audiotechnica monitors and they are not even close to the ones they use for hearing testing! They favor certain frequencies! Let’s say I test your hearing at 125hz and at 1 kHz! The difference in “music” headphones between those frequencies can be high! Let’s say your headphones they are at 0dB at 1khz right? Well they might reach +10dB at 125hz let’s say and drop 20dB at 8 kHz! You need equipment worth thousands of euros to test this kind of things and dedicated for audiometry. Also they must be calibrated! Very expensive to replicate at home!

Higher end models tend to have many adjustable programs that allow you to decrease background noise but work best when the other person is directly in front of you. Using these programs, in my experience, really limits hearing from sides and behind.

Bowling alleys super hard to hear even when I switch settings, my local Costco,  one of my local malls. Where it’s mostly better is another mall , a different Costco and Sam’s Club.

Also on the radar are Rincell 1, 2 and 3, from Rinri Therapeutics. The one that catches my attention the most is Rincell 3, because it seeks to regenerate the hair cells of the ear.
Rincell 1 has already begun its clinical trials in humans, and if everything goes well, that could accelerate the development of Rincell 2 and 3, which for now remain in the preclinical phase.

And besides, the Bionics Institute (in Australia) is doing very interesting things. It is a leading center for hearing research and is currently working on an experimental treatment with nanotechnology that seeks to repair ear cells and restore hearing.

you have a mild high frequency hearing loss in the right ear

Your left ear (blue line with X's) is totally within normal tolerances. Your right ear (red line with O's) is slightly worse across the board but still within completely normal tolerances except for the very upper range which has mild hearing loss (anything under 40dB is Mild).

The letters are the sounds in human speech you might have trouble hearing. Anything under the lines you can hear totally fine, anything above might be harder. In this case, that F, S, Th sounds.

1ocerb2,HearingLoss,Just Tired,"I have had hearing loss since middle school, now late 30's/early 40's. Loss continues to progress and is now profound in one ear (68% speech recognition) and severe in the other (80% speech recognition). I am fairly advanced in my career which also means I have to field lots of questions, supervise staff, do presentations and facilitate workshops. It's just exhausting. I rarely hear questions from the audience and need others to repeat them and every work gathering is just exhausting due to the extra attention that is needed to hear and process. My answers are sometimes off or odd bc I don't always give my brain the time to process, trying instead to keep up with the conversation. I once took a public speaking class and the teacher noted in front of everyone ""you present like English is your second language"" (he was unaware at the time, that I had a hearing loss)

More just coming to vent but also, does anyone have accomodations that have worked for them? Hearing aids are three years old but will probably see if there is any newer technology at my next appointment, as well. 

[댓글]
I completely understand what you are saying.  I haven't lost speech recognition, but when in a group of people I have an extremely hard time hearing people as all the sounds mush together.  Sometimes I just nod and smile at people because I just can't hear/understand them.  My biggest accommodation is having either my girlfriend or one of my kids with me.  For some reason I can always hone in on their voices, even in a crowd.  A lot of times I will lean in to them as ask what the person said and they repeat it to me.  However, at work, very hard to do.

Try a remote microphone that works with your hearing aids.

I’m so sorry. I have about the same speech recognition. I retired early because of hearing loss from a job that required intense listening, daily meetings and presentations, often in two languages.  Sometimes when I want some extra cash I think I might get a job in my field again (I loved my job), but the feelings you are describing keep me from going back. Best of luck to you.

Find out if you qualify for a unilateral cochlear implant. For me, it's a miraculous technology that restored the clear hearing I'd been denied for years by hearing aids. The implant bypasses the damaged part of the ear, delivering the signal directly to the auditory nerve, while the hearing aid only amplifies what's left, so the sound is distorted.

I’m so sorry you’re struggling with your hearing loss at work. I know how frustrating that can be for me. How limiting it feels. I have an Advanced Bionics cochlear implant with a Naida Marvel sound processor and a Link M hearing aid. These hearing aids (and others) have built-in Bluetooth capabilities that allow the streaming of audio directly from compatible devices (table mics, individual remote mics, television, t-coil). These assistive devices greatly improve sound quality for me. In group settings, having questioners ask their questions through a connected mic can be a huge help. Also, using [owls](https://owllabs.com/products/meeting-owl-3?srsltid=AfmBOoo_zxRoK13PHq0gKbefKQ5MaAbyhSGfov_KCDyO1geEUp6lvKhA) in remote meetings is immensely helpful, as the hard of hearing listener can more easily read lips while listening. For me, [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/?utm_campaign=SEMB%7CG%7CAMER%7CUSA%7CMeeting%7CEN%7CBT&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_semb&amp;ampDeviceId=9f7921a0-8fae-442c-b48c-d81540389919&amp;ampSessionId=1761134221787) meetings set up with an owl are ideal. With Zoom, individual speaker’s faces can be zoomed in on; the audio can stream directly to my cochlear implant and linked hearing aid; and there is live transcription as well. Perhaps you could try a similar set up; and, if it’s helpful, as an accommodation more meetings could be set up that way. Best of luck in finding a solution that works for you.

Sign language interpreters!

Your hearing aids, depending on how old, well fitted and programed by a competent Audiologist should work well enough to accommodate your hearing loss in a noisy environment. I had the same issue, however after having ear-molds made ($80) the voice separation and recognition is much better in a noisy environment. Best of luck! If your hearing aids are older, you may want to upgrade to hearing aids with dual processors that do a much better job with the help of AI technology built in. Last, I bought my last pair at Costco for $1600 vs $5000+ at a hearing center store.

I’m tired too. I can relate 100%. I’m 36 years old with otosclerosis and recently experienced an episode of sudden hearing loss and tinnitus. I lost a significant amount in what was my “good” ear. my life change at 16yrs old when I had my stapdectomy surgeries, it was like a miracle to hear. Now I’ve reverted back that age and feel that struggle all over again.  I’m going to get hearing aids idk if they will help me or not but I’m trying to find a remote job in the shittiest labor market to compensate. I would like to start a family soon too and I know otosclerosis worsens with pregnancy.

1ocek6b,HearingLoss,Rinri - Phase 1,"A Sheffield-based firm has found a therapy that may one day replace hearing devices
The world’s first human trial of a stem‑cell therapy designed to rebuild the auditory nerve and restore natural hearing has begun in the UK. 

Developed by Rinri Therapeutics, which was spun out from the University of Sheffield, the therapy, called Rincell‑1, targets severe deafness caused by damaged auditory neurons, a condition that modern hearing aids or cochlear implants cannot correct.



How the trial works
The next stage of the trial will involve 20 participants undergoing cochlear implant surgery in select NHS centres at Birmingham, Cambridge and London. Half will have age‑related hearing loss; half will have auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. 

Within each group, some will receive an injection of Rincell‑1 at the time of implant surgery, while others will proceed with the implant alone. The cells used are derived from stem cells and programmed to mature into auditory neurons, delivered via a novel surgical method to ensure precise placement.



Regulatory green light
The MHRA, the UK's medicines and healthcare products regulator, has officially approved the trial, with proof‑of‑concept data expected within 12 months of initiation. Preliminary results could emerge as early as 2027. 

Professor Doug Hartley, chief medical officer at Rinri Therapeutics, remains optimistic about the therapy’s potential. However, ENT experts like Professor Nish Mehta caution that injecting cells into the inner ear carries risks, such as further damage to residual hearing.



What success would mean
About 1.2 million people in the UK live with severe hearing loss, and 12,000 rely on cochlear implants, each costing around £20,000. While current devices provide sound perception, they don’t regenerate neural pathways and often fail in noisy settings. Rincell‑1 offers a chance to repair the underlying damage, moving toward restoration of hearing.

“Rebuilding the auditory nerve has the potential to redefine hearing care,” said Micaela Stonestreet, Clinical Audiologist at Hearology®. “This trial goes beyond simply promising improved hearing; it represents a step toward restoring natural hearing and delaying long-term reliance on external devices for severe sensorineural loss.”

Get an appointment with your ear, nose, and throat doctor if you have one, with your primary care physician if you do not. When hearing loss runs in your family or when you’ve experienced past problems with ear infections or hearing loss, it’s vital to keep your ears healthy and to react swiftly. Some hearing losses must be addressed within 72 hours to have any hope for reversal.  Godspeed! And take care of those ears. I hope you’ll feel better soon.

Also, if you don’t have an ENT, please consider becoming an established patient with one. That will make it easier to see a specialist when needed.

Hi! Thank you so much for offering your insight. I’ve been trying to make sense of a pretty rough ear experience I had a couple years ago and would love your opinion.

When I was 31, I started having pressure in one ear. I’d never had chronic ear infections or tubes before, but I was told I needed a tympanostomy tube. After it was placed, the pain was unbearable. It didn’t feel right at all. The ENT who placed it said it was one of the “post-COVID tubes” (which no one’s ever really explained to me), and ultimately, it had to be surgically removed — he couldn’t get it out in-office.

After that, the pressure in my ear never fully went away. I kept being told by different ENTs that it was just “scar tissue” on the eardrum, but it didn’t make sense — I had no prior ear procedures or infections.

Eventually, one ENT said he saw a black speck on my eardrum. He had me apply ointment and leave it alone for a week, then flush it. After that, I began having fluttering sensations and strange sounds in that ear. I was miserable, and when I went back to him, he suctioned out layers and layers of dead skin from my ear canal. He thought I would feel better, but I still didn’t. I’ve also since developed tinnitus in that ear, and it’s been constant ever since.

Later, I was diagnosed with TMJ dysfunction, and I’ve now been undergoing maxillary expansion treatment to address that. I do believe I’m starting to stabilize, and I’m hopeful that my symptoms may improve as the jaw and surrounding structures decompress and realign.

But I’m still left with some big questions:
	1.	Why would a tube placement cause that much pain and pressure in someone with no prior ear issues?
	2.	What could that black speck have been, and why did so much dead skin build up in my ear afterward? Was this possibly some kind of early cholesteatoma, or something else entirely?
	3.	Was it really just “scar tissue,” or could it have been a reaction to the tube or something related to disrupted epithelial shedding?
	4.	Could TMJ and undiagnosed Eustachian tube dysfunction have made the tube placement a poor choice for me in the first place?
	5.	And lastly — do you think my body may have gone into prolonged fight-or-flight due to the trauma of the procedure, and I’m just now finally healing as I address the root causes?

I know that’s a lot, but I’ve struggled to get real answers and would truly appreciate any insight. I’m just trying to understand what happened and whether this kind of experience is as rare as it felt. Thank you again so much for your time",2025-10-20 19:36:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1obrecz/hello_reddit_im_dr_mallory_raymond_an_ear_surgeon/
1obo58u,HearingLoss,Sensorineural Hearing Loss with Tinnitus - Treatment options?,"I’ve had sensorineural hearing loss since 2018 on one side. My hearing is completely gone on that side. It happened overnight, literally woke up one morning and bam nothing. Since that day I’ve had constant tinnitus in that ear. Somewhat like white noise like TV static but more leveled out and less chaotic. Actually kinda like pressurized air cans or air compressors. Most people I know that have had tinnitus have ringing but mine is not that at all. It’s always there though. It’s never stopped since that day I lost my hearing. Most times I can hear it at around 60-75% of the volume I can hear my own voice. I’ve had trouble being in large crowds, movie theaters, etc. When I’m around a lot of people or just loudness in general the tinnitus tends to get louder as well. Falling asleep sometimes can be very difficult if I don’t have something else like a fan or music going to cover up the tinnitus. I’ve kind of made my peace with it over the years but I’ve noticed it getting worse lately to the point sometimes it becomes overwhelming. What realistic options are there for treatment that aren’t just quackery?

Sadly there aren't really any treatments.

I have SSNHL as well.  I just lost the low tones down to 50db in one ear.  Like you, I woke up one morning and the hearing was gone, replaced with tinnitus.  The tinnitus is low sounding.  I also have high pitched tinnitus as well.  All the doctors have told me the same thing...the hearing is gone and can't be recovered.  The best that I can do is learn to cope.

Sounds like you are completely deaf in the one ear?  What you can do in loud situations is try to use something like a Loop earplug to calm the noise down which may help keep the tinnitus lower.  Or use one airpod to try and mask it.

Good luck to you!

About 10 days ago I developed ear pressure and sound sensitivity after listening to loud music in headphones. I saw an ENT this Monday (October 13th), I had audiometry and some other tests, results were OK as she said. I was advised just to rest my ears and avoid loud environments.

The recovery has been a bit up and down. Some days I feel almost normal, but other days the pressure (mostly in my left ear) comes back, especially after kitchen noise or work calls.

I took some courage and consulted doctor 5 years ago and still relying on the same doc. I just told her the above symptoms and she did audiometry that's all and said I have bilateral moderate sensorineural hearing loss. However this time I got my general body check up from a different hospital and it had ent included in the package. I was shocked seeing the audiometry result. Because my older tests and new tests are pointing to different dBHL. The duration between 2 tests i.e, older and newer one is just 6 months. All I know is this disease is progressive and this is what my doc told me and suggested me to do not wear hearphones, cover ears in cold, avoid loud noise places. I did follow all her advice yet it progresses which I can see during my audiometry test. Also she suggested me to take Meconerve Forte tablets on daily basis and I do consume them. But during my new test, the guy told me to wear hearing aids so that my inner noice is gonna stop and this will prevent hearing loss. Although I can wear hearing aids but they are too costly to make a decision. So yeah before that I wanted to know if it is true that wearing hearing aids would stop my ringing ears with preventing further hear loss? Also I want someone to guide me to understand this graph. Because 2 tests point to different result. Honestly I want to understand my disability.

I have attached my test results. The one with 35dBHL is newer test from different hospital and 42dBHL is older test from my regular hospital. 

Thanks in advance....

Basing on my experience I confirm that the ringing goes away when I'm using my aids. 

Regarding the average degree of hearing loss, there is no single formula to calculate it. IMHO it is pointless because of science of acoustic waves propagation and practical significance of different sound ranges in everyday life. 

Just keep in mind that for the most of people these lines go almost straight from top left to top right. And imagine another animals sensing much wider range of sounds from horizontal (Hz) chart.

Short answer: likely hearing aids would get rid of tinnitus and reduce deterioration of hearing. Possibly could continue to lose hearing over time based on a variety of genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and causal factors.  

From my research (new to knowing I have hearing loss and I love research). This looks like sensorineural hearing loss. Keep in mind I’m not a doctor and could definitely be wrong but something i’ve learned on SNR loss is that it can be due to a factor that causes immediate damage or (what this seems like) an underlying progressive condition. Looking up progressive causes of SNR loss online and getting a second opinion from another audiologist (if necessary) could help. 
As an aside note. When we lose the ability to hear high frequencies the general clarity of noise goes down leading to the need for increased volumes for comprehension when untreated with hearing aids. If you listen to loud music/TV or are in loud environments often this can exacerbate HL.",2025-10-19 04:31:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oagktx/want_to_understand_my_disability/

When you're looking at your audiogram, you have across the top your frequencies (kind of like keys on a piano, it goes from low pitch on the left -- 500Hz to middle pitches like 3kHz and high pitches like 6kHz). Generally speaking, the DoD and VA only categorize you as having hearing loss when any of the thresholds hits &gt;/=30.

You have normal hearing in both ears and your thresholds have not shifted significantly between your reference tests.

I work in an office environment and my office does echo I usually don’t have a hard time hearing when a lot of people are in the office and it’s loud and im on the phone I can still hear things like my grandpas old pick up truck pulling into the cul de sac when I’m home watching tv I don’t have any ringing

Not Medical Advise! Coming from an audiologist (registered in Canada), it is not typical for there to be a difference in the level of hearing loss between your ears (which is what it appears to be based on your results). It may be worthwhile to investigate further, including being referred to an ENT specialist. Regarding the enlistment, there is typically criteria for how much hearing loss you can have (based on what I have seen). If you have more than the specified hearing loss, you may still be otherwise fit to enlist if the hearing loss was treated (ie, hearing aid).

Echoing Ok-Ostrich here but with US specific information:

In the US you have to be evaluated by a doctor of audiology then subsequently medically cleared by an ENT (as you have asymmetrical hearing loss) in order to be considered for a medical waiver to join the service. You will be prohibited from going into certain career areas with your loss (ex., air traffic control). 

The ENT will likely order an MRI to rule out retrocochlear pathology (just a standard practice for asymmetries in the US and yours meets the FDA criteria). If it comes back clear, the ENT and AuD will provide supporting letters for your medical waiver. Your recruiter will likely need to provide you with the current DoD forms for the waiver. I've been out of the service for damn near 20 years so I doubt they use the same ones now that we did (hearing loss was an automatic DQ back then). 

Based on my work with active duty members at present (primarily Air Force where I am), they will likely want you to have hearing aids in both ears because of where your notch is at 1500 and 2000Hz in the right ear.

Typo I don’t have any ringing in my ears

You have a pretty substantial notch at 1k in both ears, and overall the left ear is much worse. Doesn't look like noise induced hearing loss tho.

Did your doctor suggest a possible underlying cause? You will want to know if this is going to get worse.

As for a hearing aid, that's kind of a personal decision. You're definitely missing some high frequency content but if you don't think you are having a hard time day to day, then maybe you don't need them yet.

Hey, thanks for sharing this, totally understandable to be confused after getting different feedback and especially after the military test.

From what I can see, your audiogram shows mild hearing loss in some frequencies, probably more noticeable in higher pitches (where consonants like “s”, “f”, “t” live). Your speech clarity scores (92-100%) are actually really good, which explains why you don’t feel like you struggle too much in everyday conversations unless there’s noise or echo around.

So no, your hearing isn’t “really bad,” but it’s also not perfect and the military has very strict requirements, sometimes even mild loss can make you fail their screening.

The hearing aid suggestion is likely because, in noisy places or echoey environments like your office, clarity can be affected. It doesn’t necessarily mean you *must* wear one right away, it’s more of a ""could help"" situation, depending on your lifestyle needs.

If I were you, I’d:

* Get a second opinion from a licensed audiologist (not just a hearing aid seller)
* Ask them to explain your results in plain English
* Only consider hearing aids if you actually feel you are struggling day to day
* If joining the military is still your goal, ask about specific branch requirements and waiver possibilities",2025-10-18 16:17:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1oa00fe/is_my_hearing_that_bad_based_off_my_results/

Hi, not to fearmonger but most sudden hearing loss should be treated as a medical emergency. (see ER, get ENT + audiologist referral)

If your hearing gets better with flonase/nasal spray,  that's less serious but still worth seeing an ENT to get ur ears checked.

 Anything else and you should see a doctor now  

Linking my old comment about how the whole treatment usually runs: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/s/ENHIFLbjjj

As said in other posts see ENT right away and treat like an emergency. You may need steroid treatment. I went through the same 18 months ago lost low frequencies in my left ear only.  Unfortunately urgent care treated me incorrectly and by the time i saw an ENT, through the normal slow referral process, 6 weeks had passed. I was told i had mild to moderate low frequency loss and a hearing aid could help and due to time since onset it likely saw permanent. Fast forward to yearly checkup my. Hearing has recovered to barely within the normal range but if i dont have my hearing aid in i have a heavy muffled feeling.  All this to say get to a ENT as soon as possible.

I had chronic sinusitis for many years. That can do it.

Another chronic sinusitis sufferer here.   I had sudden pressure and hearing loss in my right ear last.  I thought it was just sinus related and I waited two weeks to see my ENT.  

My ENT treated me with high dose prednisone but it was too late.  I have permanent moderate to severe high frequency hearing loss in my right ear and now have a hearing aid.  

I’d never heard of SSNHL before.  Now I know. 

Don’t wait to see an ENT or go to the ER.",2025-10-18 09:34:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o9rfdj/low_frequency_loss_due_to_cold/
1o9jtnw,HearingLoss,Hearing aids for severe hearing loss,"I experienced SSNHL earlier this year in my right ear. After oral steroids and intratympanic steroid shots my hearing loss improved slightly, but it's still moderately severe/severe hearing loss. I don't qualify for a cochlear implant so I've been trying out CROS hearing aids but they're not helping much in situations where I need the most help (loud restaurants, for example). The hearing aid specialist I talked to made it seem like I couldn't use regular hearing aids because of my level of hearing loss, but looking online the Oticon Xceed says it's for severe-to-profound loss. Does anyone have any experience using a non-CROS hearing aid for severe sensorineural hearing loss? 

[댓글]
I have profound hearing loss in my left ear. I have a set of Jabra enhanced pro from Costco. I still have difficulty hearing in loud situations (restaurants, shopping Costco, bowling), but it’s much better than have my nothing.  It’s t did take me a good 3-4 months to get used to hearing in them though.

The Oticon Xceed UP BTE is a work horse. I have professional musician's in them and they do very well. Just make sure your audiologist does Real Ear Measures on you or they're just a hack (or a high school graduate working at Costco -- minus the Nashville area where they're all AuDs).

ReSound's Enzo Q UP is really great as well and actually hits prescriptive targets on my patients. Jabra is a ReSound company, but that model is not a UP BTE and is NOT appropriate for a severe to profound hearing loss.

I used to recommend Phonak, but I can't get the damn things to hit past 4kHz (a real disappointment). Ironically, while Unitron is Phonak's sister company, their aids are more powerful than Phonak and hit prescriptive targets better.

Anyone putting a person with severe to profound hearing loss in a model with a wire (receiver in the canal, receiver in the ear --- RIC/RITE) shouldn't be dispensing hearing aids. For moderately-severe to severe, if your best unaided threshold is &gt;50 then a UP BTE is still the most logical choice. You'll hit saturation way too fast on a RIC/RITE and the battery drain is just stupid. I prefer having a lot of power because it brings clarity without risk of hitting the gain ceiling. Plus, if your hearing continues to change, it's better to have a model where you can keep having the volume turned up appropriately than to be told to buy a new aid.

I tried the phonak audeo sphere 90 from May until just last week. I wore it during all waking hours the entire time to try to help my brain adjust. 

I have a similar story and timeline as you, it seems. I did go fully deaf and then recovered to a steep slop into severe. 

Pros- it helps me hear better and better sound echolocation. I loved the streaming component, even though that ear really stinks. It was so loud my good ear could hear and help out my bad ear in clarity. 🤣

Cons - my word recognition is sh*t. Only 35%ish. I have a lot of “extra noise” interference from the broken speaker in my head. I think going fully deaf in that ear then bouncing some back just means my brain is super confused by the two different signals and when it combines them it spits out extra noise. 

Sadly, I recently realized this extra noise is so much louder with the hearing aid. It’s amplifying distortion. So…. I’ve decided (after consulting my audiologist), for now, my hearing aid will be used strategically and when I need it. 

I think you should try it and see how your brain does!!!

1o9igs1,HearingLoss,Normal range but muffled in one ear,"I've had trouble with my ears since around 4-5 years old when teachers picked up on it when I first started school and they noticed I was lip reading. I have had grommets twice in right ear and a myringotomy and grommets once in left ear, had loads of ear infections as a child and also had a hearing aid as a teenager which they said I didn't need further down the line although it did help a lot, I’ve had a perforated eardrum and also have a retraction pocket and head of malleus is visible. I have had muffled hearing in my right ear as long as I can remember and went to ENT for another hearing test (pure tone) this year which showed hearing within the normal range (20db) although it had got slightly worse since my last test. I also had a tympanometry test which showed that my right eardrum is very stiff which I’m assuming is probably due to scar tissue. After the hearing test they said there was nothing they could do and I wasn't bad enough for a hearing aid but I know my hearing isn't great in my right ear and if I cover my left ear I can barely hear out of my right one and it is all muffled, whereas if I cover my good ear the sound is unchanged and seems to me that’s where most of my hearing is. I was referred for an MRI internal auditory meatus in 2020 and only got sent to have it done 2 months ago and still waiting on results! I just feel like the audiology department are not listening to me when I say I can hardly hear out of my right ear!

1o95lgv,HearingLoss,What features should I look for as a musician?,"I just did a hearing test and I have been categorized as mild to moderate hearing loss. I play as a drummer in a band, and I struggle to hear clearly, this places me in a tricky situation. I would still like to play music. I’m a bit worried about how hearing aids might change my perception most especially when it comes to tone, balance and dynamics while performing. 


I am not sure what I should be looking at, please share some pointers for what worked for you ? Did you have to tweak the setting specifically for music mode?  I really want to keep playing without losing that natural feel for sound that music gives me.

[댓글]
As a musician, definitely look for hearing aids with a dedicated music mode not just speech optimization. You’ll want models with wide dynamic range, low compression, and minimal noise reduction, since those features can distort tone and balance.   
  
Brands like Widex, Oticon Real, and Phonak Lumity are good to use for a musician for their natural sound profiles.  
  
You can also ask your audiologist to fine-tune a “music program” with less processing, so you get the raw sound you’re used to.

Hearing aids will give you a restoration of normal loudness across the frequencies where you have hearing loss.

Most manufacturers that fit your hearing loss range have a very wide dynamic range (echoing pep\_tounge here), though the current models are:

Widex Allure (many musician's like these though I will say they do have noticeable circuit noise, the sound quality is amazingly clear, crisp, and natural)

ReSound Vivia (my patients have been loving these and I have quite a few percussionists that I see)

Oticon Intent 

Phonak Infinio (I cannot recall ever having a musician enjoy Phonak's sound quality)

Unitron Moxi Smile (yes, they're Phonak's sister company, but holy crap do they sound different -- Unitron is better imo)

Signia IX (I've had a love/hate relationship with this manufacturer)

Starkey Edge AI (they have a great sound quality to them, just don't get their in-the-ear models, they've been troublesome for my patients)

  
Those are all of the current manufacturers and their current models. The majority of my professional musicians wear Widex, ReSound, and Oticon. 

A totally random observation of mine is that those who play bluegrass (especially banjo, mandolin, and steel guitar) LOVE Oticon. 

A lot of my jazz, blues, and lounge musicians prefer ReSound.

I've had everyone from death metal and black metal musicians all the way to folk and singer-songwriters enjoy Widex. 

The only way to know what \*you\* like is to listen to each of them. Just make sure your audiologist is using DSL-5A for you during the demo and, like pep\_tounge said, make sure they put it in the music program and let you listen to recordings of your own band or your favorite bands.",2025-10-17 16:12:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o95lgv/what_features_should_i_look_for_as_a_musician/

1o8qq8g,HearingLoss,Hearing loss and reactive tinnitus - what can help,"I just wanted to share something that may help others.

I lost all my high frequencies in my right ear after an infection in April of this year. Since then, I've had tinnitus which is very reactive after driving/restuarants etc. It will scream at me for hours when it does react.

I bought the apple AirPods and uploaded an audiogram. I've discovered that if I don't use them when out (I often forget to take them and can manage with my hearing in most situations anyway), but instead put them in when I get home - the reactive part of my tinnitus calms down within minutes. This is repeatable for me and helps me manage.

Hopefully this helps someone else.

1o8ifk4,HearingLoss,Looking for others with experience,"Hi! 30 f in NY. I have celiac disease (undiagnosed for unknown years). With mixed hearing loss on my left side. Many years of tubes, ear drum reconstruction and wearing hearing aid. 

Recently (May2025) the office I was seeing told me they could no longer help and sent me to see another more specialized ENT. where they conducted hearing tests and the Dr concluded that I would be a candidate for a bone anchored hearing device (August 2025). We went back for a eval with the audiologist who does the baha (bone anchored hearing aids) and she insisted that my over the ear or in the ear hearing aid just needed updating to match my latest hearing test and a larger dome to trap in the noise that was leaking out around my previous style and that while I am a candidate for the surgical implant she wants me to exhaust all my other non surgical options first. 

Anyone else have an experience similar? Did you go from the over the ear hearing aid to baha and regret it? Does the Baha sound any different? 

[댓글]
Hello this just happened to me. I went to another clinic that was in network and they came up with I didn’t not need a BAHA. I think that’s bs so I ordered a BAHA

I switched clinics to get the baha fully covered but the new place doesn’t seem to be up to sped with this tech like not getting the other place ordered to get it planted into my head!!

I can’t communicate with any of these “professionals” they don’t share what they are doing or ordering

I still don’t have a hearing aid and I saw the audiologist today who wanted me to wear a regular HA in my super small ear that isn’t self cleaning and wouldn’t let much sound through 

ARGH

Yeah, that’s actually really solid advice from your audiologist. It’s always best to max out non-surgical options before going for a BAHA, especially if your current aid can be retuned or refit with a larger dome  
  
BAHA can sound *clearer* for conductive loss, but it’s also a commitment  surgery, healing time, and maintenance. Many people say the sound is more “direct” and natural, but not necessarily life-changing if a good traditional aid still works.   
  
Try the updated hearing aid first; if it still doesn’t meet your needs, you’ll know the BAHA choice is the right next step.",2025-10-16 21:11:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o8ifk4/looking_for_others_with_experience/

I had multiple severe ear infections as a kid, and they did end up affecting my hearing so it is a possibility. I wouldn't immediately assume that he is inflicting too much damage on his ears if he's hitting them unless its while he has had the ear infections, as the tissue is weaker.

However as someone who dealt with hearing loss as a child, he will be okay. He is young enough to adapt and figure out what works for him, compared to adults losing their hearing and having to completely readjust.

That being said, start looking into hearing aids and asl classes (for him and the family). Many states now have decent funding to help cover the cost, and the sooner he gets used to wearing hearing aids is better. 

Also make sure that he doesnt struggle with socializing, as a kid this is likely the biggest impact he will face, as it is easy to miss out on things or misunderstand things when you can't hear. 

If you find him not being responsive to you saying things, (while keeping in mind that kids are stubborn and will definitely try to use hearing loss as an excuse sometimes lol) work on him reading your lips. ""Whatch my mouth"" was frequently said in my household and the skill of lip reading really does go a long way for those with hearing impairments.

Besides all of that, make sure he is aware of what noise damage can do. Especially as he becomes a teen, any loud music, games, headsets and more can damage his ears even worse, so ear protection is a must even if it doesnt feel necessary.

Definitely go to an ent, the main thing i would be concerned about is if his hearing routinely tests worse. But there are surgerys that can be done now that seem to be affective, so don't take any of it too hard at the moment.

No hearing loss for either parent. 

Has had ear infections in the past to some extent. Negative on everything else. He does have a low muscle tone which means he bobbles his head a lot and I have always constantly been worried that he is banging his head too much on things.

First off I'm sorry to hear your kid is going through this. 


I'm not a medical professional, but just sharing what I know when i experienced SUDDEN sensorineural hearing loss: 

Please correct me if I'm misinformed on any of this. 

Only treatment for that would be 
- high dose cortecosteroid for a few weeks (usually oral prednisone) 
- intratympanic ear injections (some ENT refuse to do this for risk of further damaging the ear drum) 
- *hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) 

BUT you mentioned he had ear infections in the past, i suspect that might have played a significant part. Not to fearmonger, but the hearing loss might compounded from older infections/injuries like these. 
 
AS WELL AS the low muscle tone and head banging, I'm not sure. By right your ENT should be referring your kid for an MRI and/or any other further investigation to rule out neurological issues (or any damage to his auditory and Vestiblar nerves). Hope you might be able to seek a neurologist or physiciatrist for more insight.

*HBOT is the only experimental option I've heard about approved for (sudden) hearing loss, the patient is put in a pressurized chamber around 2.4ATA and breathes in 100% oxygen for 90-120minutes over 20-40 sessions. 

The idea is the increased circularion might help recovery with the inner/middle ear functions. But the downside is without insurance, its incredibly costly. 
And there are many private practices they do not actually have medical-grade chambers to go up to therapeutic pressure levels. Also be sure to check they actually use anti-static grounding bands.



And with hearing loss in general, time is absolutely a factor, you'd want to get your kid started on ANY treatment as soon as possible. I'm not sure if his loss was sudden, but the recovery window for sudden hearing loss is pretty short (recovery chances exponentially decrease after 24-72h, 14days, 30 days (salvage) as a rough guideline) 

Wishing all the best for your kid

Do your or the child's father/mother having hearing issues?

Did he hit his head? Have bad ear infections? Deformed eardrum or ear canal? Bad wax? Brain/nerve tumor?

Audiologist chiming in:

Has your son ever have a head injury (sports, motor vehicle accident, bicycle wreck, etc.)?

1. They need to do a CT to see why the mixed hearing loss is there. He has a normal/Type A tympanogram (normal eardrum movement), meaning there is NO fluid in his middle ear space (no infection). 

2. If surgery is recommended, insist on having it done by Alejandro Rivas, MD (neuro-otology). [https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Rivas-Alejandro-1174662977](https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Rivas-Alejandro-1174662977) \-- Yes it's a drive, but that man is one of the most gifted surgeons I've ever worked with and he sees pediatric patients. 

3. You need to get an IEP (Individualized Education Plan) for your son sooner rather than later. Talk to his school about this ASAP.

4. Do not be devastated. He has normal hearing in his right ear and while his word understanding ability is fair in his left ear, it is still a useable ear. If the CT comes back with a result where surgery is not recommended, he needs to be fit with a hearing aid. He will need either a bone-anchored hearing aid (like the Osia -- [https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/home/products-and-accessories/cochlear-osia-system](https://www.cochlear.com/us/en/home/products-and-accessories/cochlear-osia-system) \-- he's borderline for this device, so a neuro-otologist would have to make that call) or an ultra power behind-the-ear hearing aid (like an Oticon Xceed Play UP) because of how precipitous the drop off is at 3kHz. 

5. If the CT is normal (miraculously), consider a genetic workup for your son, you and his father. As another poster pointed out, there may be a double recessive genetic factor going on here (this is common when someone has hearing loss only in one ear). Longjumping also has an excellent point regarding chronic ear infections. I concur with Longjumping that this is a possible etiology for your son's loss. 

  
Keep in mind, &gt;&gt;no surgical intervention will make your son's hearing normal&lt;&lt;. Those little brackets let us audiologist's know where the hearing loss really is because it reflects the quietest the hearing sense organ itself can hear. With the best surgeon in the world, he will have normal to moderate hearing loss \*at best\*. 

It's 2025, there are neuro-otology surgeons with bilateral cochlear implants --&gt; [https://www.chadruffinmd.com/](https://www.chadruffinmd.com/) and we have Deaf pediatricians --&gt; [https://www.rit.edu/ntid/deafhub/news/zachary-featherstone](https://www.rit.edu/ntid/deafhub/news/zachary-featherstone) . Hearing loss is NOT a barrier to success. What matters to him is that you love and support him. We all have our own medical alphabet soup going on, what matters most is our attitude towards what wound up in our bowl and he will learn how to handle things by watching how you handle things. Be his strength!

I’m so sorry to hear that you are devastated that your child has a condition in line with almost everyone in this subreddit that you posted in asking for help. 

The biggest solution is: educated yourself. Support your child by talking to them on the side without hearing loss, empower your child to communicate their needs to others, realise that hearing loss isn’t some tragic devastating horrible thing and no one with hearing loss is happy. Apart from that leave it to the medical experts I guess.",2025-10-16 16:36:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o8b1wh/7_year_old_severe_mixed_hearing_loss/

It’s hard to describe what it’s like. I can say I can’t hear well, I can describe the tinnitus or fullness feeling, the fact that I can’t filter out the background noise, but I can’t make someone understand. I can only tell them how to help (be on my “good side” or face me when it’s too loud). Hoping HA will help, I have a fitting appointment on Tuesday.

I don't bother anymore. There's no point imo. 

Yes, it absolutely sucks having all those moments and such ruined (especially when it's by a lack of patience from whoever I'm hanging out with) - but a) I don't dwell on trying to make people understand negative situations, and b) if people really care, then they'll ask and will likely already be understanding - the rest aren't worth my time. Sorry but I've been deaf for over 30 years - I gave up trying to explain it to people decades ago. The ones I ""have to explain it to"", are the type not worth explaining it to, ime.

Too often people have acted annoyed when I can't hear them, acting like hearing is a choice - they don't need or deserve an explanation at that point 🤷💯

The rest, as soon as I say I'm half deaf, in the high frequency range so there's large gaps in speech, they get it and are understanding &amp; accomodating. Don't worry about willfully ignorant people - the people that care about you will understand with a basic explanation. 🫶

It's so much more than even connection. When I lost my hearing I've had memory loss, confidence loss, and just the willpower to do basic things. It's just incredible what you lose when you lose your hearing.

I was recently wondering if there was a hearing loss simulator so my family would understand what it’s like.

Honestly, I don't. I explain it being like the cone of silence in get smart. (To people my age or older.) But I don't think people *really* get it. 

I didn't realize how many issues I was having hearing because it was a gradual shift. My husband would always talk to me from the other side of the house and get mad when I couldn't hear him 🙄  whenever people would lower their voice to say something quietly, I was screwed. I didn't realize how much I was missing or how much I was lip reading.  It affected my relationships at work and how I dealt with social situations.  (Large crowds=no.  One on one,  yes.) 

Around the time I was going through the process of getting my hearing tested and hearing aids, we got a pair of kittens.  The one meowed so quietly and at a pitch I literally could not hear it.  I about cried when I finally could.

just tell them you can't hear well. most understand and can be very considerate. if you miss something, ask for repeat. if you can't hear well in a restaurant or similar, don't go with a group or at all

I have them do an experiment. 
For one day, I tell them that in order to communicate with anyone they MUST be looking at that person. Face to face so they can see their lips. If they can’t, then they cannot be successfully communicating with them. If it’s dark and you cannot see their lips in the dark, you cannot “hear” or communicate with them. If there is anything in or in front of their mouth, you cannot hear them. If there is any other sound coming from the surrounding environment the chances of you hearing them correctly AND being able to comprehend them is about 20%. 

I suggest that they do this for a week. 

I’ve yet to have any participants last more than 2 days.

I have degenerative hearing loss, but I can still hear most conversation without hearing aids. In crowded rooms I miss jokes, the start of conversations and moments that can't simply be repeated without stalling the conversation. My work has a very busy canteen and we sit on long tables. I am basically cut off from all the people on my side of the table because I can't see their mouths. I have to play a bit of a game of social dynamics to guess which side will dominate the conversation when I sit 

My father's hearing loss is more profound. He lost it slowly for years then an infection removed everything from one ear all at once. He was on a waiting list for a monaural hearing aid for months and the difference was profound. He withdrew and went from being confident and engaged to being quiet because he was concerned he was speaking too loudly or unable to participate in conversations at all. He's better now, though he's still acclimatising. 

My hobbies are role playing and public speaking. I'm terrified of losing that connection with my friends and an audience. I'm learning lip reading with private lessons now to prepare but I worry about the loss of connection.

People honestly cannot understand other than those who knew me before my severe hearing loss. Some think hearing aids should fully compensate. Sadly they do not.

That’s so true it’s not just about sound, it’s about feeling connected. Helping others understand that makes such a big difference ❤️

It's been a struggle trying to explain it to my parents. It's taken a couple of years of fighting every movie night to convince them to turn subtitles on, and they only really do it now because sound editing on modern movies is so bad that even they can't hear because everyone's always whispering and being drowned out by music and sound effects. My dad gets angry with me when I have to ask him to repeat himself a lot, like it's some kind of game I like to play just to mess with him in specific. They try to talk to me from other rooms and act like I'm ignoring them when I don't answer because *I didn't fucking hear that they were talking to me*. I'd say I wish I could just give them my ears for a day and let them hear for themselves what it's like for me, but I honestly think a lot of my problem is also auditory processing issues due to being autistic, so really I'd have to trade brains with them, too. 
Silver linings, though- I got a tube in my worse ear this year that's done a world of difference already. Had to fight for months to get my mom to schedule me an appointment after I started getting on-again, off-again earaches and a different kind of tinnitus than I've been used to my whole life, but I finally got it. I think she understands a little more of it after seeing me cry when Eric Clapton's Wonderful Tonight came on the radio on the way home from the surgery because I'd noticed a whole new layer of guitars that I'd just... been completely unable to hear until now. Music is one of my biggest passions, so having my eyes (and ears, lmao) opened to just how much of it I've been missing out on has been mind blowing these past few months, to say the least.

Too many people around me already suffer from

1o7j137,HearingLoss,Input from your experiences...,"I experienced SSNHL over two years ago.  Because of that I've struggled with the loss and corresponding tinnitus that came with it.  I have come to terms with the loss and have been able to manage my tinnitus most of the time so there is that.

You can see in the pic what my loss is today.   Don't pay attention to the right ear as that loss has been since birth.  It's the left ear that was affected.  When I first experienced the SSNHL in the left ear, it leveled out with a 50db loss at the 250 and 500 range, while the 1k range was about a 30db loss.  Everything else is what you see in the pic.

I'm very aware regarding changes in my hearing and when things sound weird.  In the last two years I sometimes get spikes in my tinnitus when I'm stressed or have lack of sleep.  Once I am able to sleep or lower stress then my tinnitus goes back down.  During spikes I also notice a bit of a dip in the 250, 500, and 1k range...maybe 5db change...but that goes right back once I get some sleep.  Yesterday was different.  My own voice started sounding different...like a touch of a echo/robotic/speaker sound.  So of course I was on high alert and took a hearing test.  I noticed that the 1k had jumped from 30 to 20, and the 500 from 50 to 45.  I was out talking to people and I noticed that voices, especially women, had that same touch of robotic/speaker echo to it.  I ended up going home and going to sleep and this morning my hearing levels are what you see.  It's been that way all day, but I still have that odd echo with voices.  It's faint but I can hear it...I guess because my brain is on high alert.  Yes I love that it seems my hearing has improved a bit, but I don't like it when things change...especially when things sound weird.

So here is the reason for my post...I want to hear from all you people with hearing loss to find out if you've experienced anything similar in regards to changes in loss levels (good or bad), changes in hearing, perceived sounds, etc.  I want to discover if this is normal for people with this type of loss or if it's just me.  

Share your experiences, regarding changes and fluctuations, with me and the rest of this sub as I'm sure it could help a lot of people!

Mimi hearing tests arent a substitute for a booth test so unfortunately it wont tell you much.

it is manageable, you need to stop going to places with loud noise. don’t go to the place where noise is above 75 db, use earplugs in those environments…download NIOSH app to check noise level… you can text me in inbox as well.

1o6ydpr,HearingLoss,just a vent,"posting from a throwaway account because i just need to vent and honestly i feel embarrassed at this point. 

long story short, i had an ABR done and made me seem like i totally exaggerated on my hearing tests. i am so confused and upset. i had been accused of this before, which is why i did the ABR in the first place. i truly went into it thinking it would prove me right and now it seems i have somehow caused more doubt. 

i am just so frustrated with myself. i did my absolute best on the hearing test, but i really struggled due to severe tinnitus and my emotions (i was extremely anxious and cried during the word recognition score part). i gave my honest responses but it still wasnt accurate and it has me seriously questioning myself. 

has anyone else experienced anything like this? i guess i am not a reliable tester despite my efforts :(

What’s an abr?

Sitting in a hearing test booth is pure hell on earth no human being should have to sit in there I hate it too. I e cried too. 

What are the tests saying? 

Are you having trouble hearing?

I’ve also cried during hearing exams, especially the word recognition section. They’re very stressful. Even the listening for beeps can be stressful when you sense during long lulls that you should be hearing something that you’re not. Please be gentle with yourself. 

If you’re experiencing hearing loss, your experience of the situation is what matters. There’s no need to be ashamed because the tests don’t seem to show as grave a loss as you would expect. I’ve had that happen too. Multiple times.

Trust your experience. Keep seeking help. It can take a while to find the right support team. And most importantly, hang in there!!

the difference between booth testing and the ABR appears to be only a difference of ~10-15 dB, which can be variable in the booth with tinnitus and emotions running high. I’d say the ABR confirmed the severity of your loss and you should be a candidate for CI based on those results

i agree. its hard because it follows me too. i went to Penn for all of this and its following me to other hospitals because they keep sending my records so i cant even get a fresh second opinion. so frustrating",2025-10-15 01:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o6ydpr/just_a_vent/

1o6ii45,HearingLoss,Dealing with the disconnect,"I've had multiple medical issues this year, including completely losing hearing in my right ear because I didn't act fast enough. Well, a week ago today, I lost hearing in my left ear as well. I'm on steroids to see if they can help, but it's too soon to know, and as is, I have completely lost hearing in both ears. As someone who always had background noise on, be it a YouTube video, a podcast, music, or the radio, the sound of nothing but my tinnitus has been tough to cope with. I feel completely disconnected from the world around me, even in my own home.

No. Even if your inner ear is damaged, it can be bypassed with a Cochlear Implant. It won't be easy, but you will get used to it and you will be able to hear again. Otherwise, you can wait some time. Cochlear implants will get better with time.. who knows, maybe in 10, or 5, 20, years, or even less, an cochlear implant that's better than inner ear may be released.. or maybe a treatment to restore the cochlea.. I rexommend you to choose to wait, or trying to get a cochlear implant rn. Good luck friend.

1o5ur7u,HearingLoss,Cookie Bite Hearing Loss.. What am I doing?,"Hi everyone, I need some help understanding myself and my hearing needs.

Heads up: Sorry for writing so all over the place, I'm honestly all over the place but I don't know who to talk to specifically about this. If you got the time and  you're okay to read and help with a comment I appreciate it. 

About me: 

I am 20 years old and I recently found out I had cookie bite both ears, instead of normal loss of hearing.

Context: 

I realized I struggle with my hearing when pandemic hit. Up until that point, relying on reading lips and being mostly in loud environments, I had no issue in conversations or overall being affected by it like at home, outside, or in school and I thought that's what everyone does. I don't know how but I managed to get through it. I never knew my hearing was ever lost / not there until we had to wear masks back to school. At that point it was hard to hear anything and hard to understand what's going on around me. Because of financial struggles I haven't been quick in getting my first hearing aids but within a couple months I got my first pair after using my AirPods transparency mode to get me through the first months wearing masks in school or always choosing to do my classes online. All doctors in my city I been to, for getting a proper diagnosis, never mentioned anything about me having this so-called Cookie Bite. They kept asking me when did I lose my hearing and what other health issues I had (heart disease, bad immunity). I couldn't tell them the specifics because I was confused myself and therefore they couldn't give me a specific diagnosis, just that I have severe hearing loss and to get hearing aids. I got my hearing aids, on my second pair now and it's been 5 years and I still struggle sometimes with hearing even with hearing aids. I was told it's normal and to not stress too much about it. Anyways, I came to study in the UK and going into my last year in uni, an ad for a free hearing consultation I found somewhere popped up this summer and I took that chance just to see what thoughts I could get from here. The doctor that examined my ears and tested my ears was very open and helped me understand everything. Also the test I took here was way better than the other many tests I took back in my country. Like. I could finally hear some sounds and click on the thing proper. That's when he explained me the results and  found out it was genetics and I'm missing the mids. 

Problem: I don't know anything about my disability and what can help me. I don't know if I'm eligible for anything in the UK as a disabled person, I tried to apply for allowance but I'm not eligible because I haven't lived in the UK for 3 years yet (I have settled status) and I'm just now in my final year at uni, 3rd year. Do I learn sign language? I would love to be able to communicate this language as well. Where do I find resources in the UK? And there are so many ways to learn it like different styles British, American, etc. I'm so lost and overwhelmed. I still haven't accepted my disability in full, like I'm okay with this whole thing but the problem is I dedicated my whole life to music. And chose a music career. And I also got laughed at for that. Which should not be taken seriously but it's bad because I'm a sensitive person and been bullied before for other things that shaped me the way I am and I'm healing everyday. I'm also feeling excluded and lonely and always struggling to blend in with my peers. Even when I get out of my comfort zone and take the first step. I'm just not on the same line and I'm probably seen as weird. I feel extra behind and helpless and I know it's also because of my fear and anxiety and just overall personality, I used to be so extroverted and everything changed for me since the pandemic. I just don't feel like myself and I'm still learning and taking one step at a time and focusing on stuff that I enjoy.

Question: What am I doing?

1o5t49o,HearingLoss,Exploring the Role of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) in Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL) Management,"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells of the inner ear or the auditory nerve pathways are damaged. This damage prevents sound signals from reaching the brain as it normally would, causing reduced hearing. Common causes include noise exposure, aging (presbycusis), infections (like meningitis), Meniere’s disease, vascular or autoimmune inner-ear disorders, ototoxic drugs, and acoustic neuromas. SNHL affects millions of people worldwide and can greatly hinder communication skills, resulting in reduced quality of life, social withdrawal, and a higher likelihood of cognitive decline. Unlike conductive hearing loss, which affects the outer or middle ear, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) usually results from permanent damage to the sensory hair cells in the cochlea or the auditory nerve, making it much more difficult to treat successfully. Currently, standard treatments for sensorineural hearing loss (hearing aids, cochlear implants, corticosteroids, etc.) focus on managing symptoms rather than restoring hearing. This is where platelet-rich plasma comes in. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous product (comes from the patient's own blood) which is concentrated to contain high levels of growth factors, cytokines, and platelets. These are the very components which are essential for wound healing and tissue regeneration, ultimately supporting cellular growth, differentiation, and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). The regenerative properties within Platelet-rich plasma are particularly promising for treating conditions where traditional therapies have limited efficacy, such in the case of SNHL. The use of PRP in otology is founded on the idea that its growth factors may help stimulate the regeneration of cochlear hair cells and auditory nerve fibers, thus restoring some degree of hearing function. If you’d like to learn more about how PRP and other regenerative therapies may help manage sensorineural hearing loss, the blog below provides an overview of the current information.

1o5jsfl,HearingLoss,Ramble vent,"honestly I don't know what Im intending from this post. Maybe somebody with similar issues to me can make me feel less lost. 

I had moderate hearing loss as a young child and frequent infections/perforations. I had surgery performed for grommets 4 different times. After a certain point my hearing was at least functional and no longer got followed up on. I went through my teenage years with no monitoring of my hearing.

Now I'm 23 and following up on my physical health. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and auditory processing difficulties and wanted to check if any of my issues with understanding speech were related to my childhood history.

So I got a hearing test today. Mild hearing loss. my right ear is worse but still mild. It's caused by scarring on my ear drums. my inner ear works normally and my test results for bone conducting were in normal range and I could noticeably tell the difference.

I feel very unsure of everything at the moment. The audiologist recommended fitting for hearing aids and I feel almost imposter syndrome at the idea, as if my hearing loss is not enough for that. I also feel nervous about how hearing aids will affect/be affected by my ADHD and auditory processing.
But reading about the effects of mild hearing loss feels both validating and depressing. So many experiences match up: finding social settings overwhelming, constant feelings of exhaustion especially after situations of having to take in a lot of auditory information, difficulty with short term memory, hearing what people are saying but not understanding it, constantly needing to have people repeat themselves.

And the weirdest feeling is knowing that this is purely because of scar tissue, that if I had unscarred eardrums I would be able to hear perfectly fine and potentially so many of these difficulties ive been struggling with for years wouldn't have caused me so many issues.

Is there anyone here who has been in my shoes? Where do I go from here?

I have not had similar experiences, but look into bone conduction headphones and/or hearing aids. Your loss is conductive, so it will likely be extremely helpful. Best of luck &lt;3

I can’t speak on hearing aids with ADHD but hearing aids are a great options for people with auditory processing disorders. Someone with APD would benefit from getting even a small boost in sound, which might improve processing and understand. 

However, APD cannot be diagnosed in people with hearing loss. That doesn’t mean that someone can’t have both (maybe they are born with APD and diagnosed with hearing loss later in life). But to diagnose APD, it requires a number of tests. Those test assume that person has normal hearing. Otherwise, it’s impossible to know whether the person scored poorly because of processing difficulties or because of hearing loss.

I have messed up ear drums. Don’t look back always forward. Don’t layer negative feelings and spiral. Onward! Lots of people on here wearing aids. GL!",2025-10-13 13:31:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o5jsfl/ramble_vent/
1o5jpw0,HearingLoss,Starting to get Tinnitus,"Hi yall!

I’m 20 years old and over the past few months I started to notice that my hearing isn’t the same as it used to be. 

For context: I like making music, and for A LONG TIME (13-17 years old) I was a kid that listened to music at maximum volumes with ear plugs on. I was so dumb and I completely regret it. But there’s nothing to do about that anymore.

When I was 18 I gained consciousness and started to listening to things at lower levels and still do (I guess). But anyways a little damage is already done.

I noticed that whenever the ambient I am is silent I don’t feel the complete silence because there’s this cicada-like noise in the background of my head, and even in ambients with a certain amount of noise, if I concentrate, I can still hear it.

Important: I didn’t go to a doctor yet to see what is really happening, but soon I’ll do.

1o511tt,HearingLoss,Am I going deaf in one ear permanently or temporary?,"I went shooting with friend of mine earlier today and now my right ear’s hearing has gradually reduced. We were shooting for about an hour (not very long) with a couple of different guns. We had ear plugs and I brought some overhead noise canceling headphones to use at the same time. It’s not my first time shooting so I know how important ear protection is. My hearing was fine when we stopped, until I noticed when I got home that my hearing in my right ear was noticeably getting lower. 

There’s no ringing but it feels just like if my ear has some earwax or how it feels like after swimming sometimes. I went to the bathroom and tried cleaning my ears with a q-tip and an ear syringe, to no avail. I can still hear from it but more faintly and my left ear is completely fine. The gunstock was on the right side of my chest because I am right handed so I think that had something to do with it. 

Am I going deaf permanently in one ear or will this go away with time? It’s only been like 4-5 hours since we went shooing but how long should I wait for it to get better before I go see a doctor? Any advice would be much appreciated.

[댓글]
Tl;dr same advice as usual. All hearing loss thar doesnt improve within a few hours is DOCTOR. NOW. If you are really hesistant, the max i'd wait is less than 12 hours.
you also have to account for waiting time to see the doctor which can stretch equally long. 

1. Do not aggrevate the ear with qtip/hydrogen peroxide/ear wash. You will make this worse if it isn't earwax. 

2. Did u wear noise cancelling headphones or noise protection EARMUFFS?
 because headphones literally blast a inverted wave of sound into your ears to cancel out whatever the external microphone picks up. (ie the headphones most definitely amplified the pressure from gunshot noise, not cancel it).  

You didn't mention any vertigo or tinnitus, so its a toss up if this is an emergency or urgent.

Regardless as someone who's hearing loss started with the same sensations, please see an ENT or ER doctor ASAP so they can 

1) rule out earwax blockage or eardrum rupture 
2) if any more serious damage is found, they can start you on cortecoidsreroids (which is a controlled substance so only they can prescribe it). 
You're within the first 24 hours, so your chances of a full recovery are almost 100% if you start now. 
Every day you wait reduces those odds drastically.

Weird, as a right handed shooter usually my left ear is affected more

Noise cancelling headphones masks sound, it doesn't lower the dB levels. They're not made to protect you from hearing damage from loud noises.

1o4o5fh,HearingLoss,Miracle healing,"Hello guys. I lost my hearing in the right ear on 7 March 2025. I noticed since yesterday my hearing improved by a large margin. I had a big drop in bass and middle frequencies in the right ear. I did everything, from 4-5 rounds of steroids, MRI 3 Tesla with contrast to check if something is growing inside.  No tumors! I suspected the TMJ. I had all the symptoms.  After 2 days of decompressing neck and head muscles the pain was gone. I remember thinking: ""man clearly this is it with the head pain but no improvement in hearing. Like 5 days ago, after some head stretches I noticed a strong head pain, my middle frequencies in hearing busted, blasting tinnitus. After few days this went away. After months of hearing loss and sensation of full ear I noticed my hearing greatly improved. Like that! Like it went 8-9 months ago , this is how it came back. I had in the past a little bit of ""recoveries"" but this time is very different. The ear is tingling and painful at the same time but in a good way.

Ciao, spero veramente che sia così, ma sarebbe davvero un miracolo; In letteratura , i casi di recupero a 3 mesi sono già bassi, dopo i 6 sono prossimi allo zero, ma forse sei stata molto fortunata !

What stretching/exercises did you do?

One wonders if there was an underlying migrane pathology to this and your trigeminal nerve stimulation resulted in improvements to inner ear blood flow that were dysfunctional. i suspect this as you said you lost low to mid frequency hearing, hence suspected cochlear hydrops, hence we would look to possible migraine-spectrum pathology if other causes (e.g viral) are ruled out.

It’s rare, but spontaneous hearing recovery *can* happen, especially if your loss was related to nerve inflammation, TMJ tension, or circulation issues.   
  
Definitely follow up with your ENT and get a new audiogram to document the improvement it’ll help track any residual loss or stability. Keep doing gentle neck and jaw stretches if they help, but avoid overdoing it.   
  
And protect that ear from loud sounds for a while it’s still healing. Amazing to hear you’ve gotten such progress after months.

ever since i was 14, I've had these fleeting episodes of my hearing dipping and intense ringing. these episodes are known as fleeting tinnitus, but mine were slightly more complicated. they lasted around 10-60 minutes, depending on the intensity. when i was 14 to 16, i didn’t think anything of it. the episodes were annoying but i had them once or twice a year and they always resolved completely within minutes to an hour.

that was until i learned what SSHL was this year. i had about 8-9 of these episodes throughout my whole life. i don’t lose my hearing during them, i understand speech perfectly fine, i even hear birds, but it’s extremely uncomfortable pressure and some sounds appear to be very sharp (rustling, running water, etc.). very distressing!

this september, i had yet another episode and rushed to ENT and an audiologist immediately, in case it was SSHL, keep what was left of my hearing and start steroids. they told me it wasn’t SSL since i had 8 of them in total already. my audiograph showed no hearing loss as well.

they didn’t give me a definitive answer as to what it was. i insisted it could be complicated SSHL and that i am going slowly deaf but none of the ENTs I saw agreed with it. some said it could be my eustachian tube acting up as it happened mostly when i was lying in bed (during sleep, after waking up, etc), or that something’s up with my inner ear. i wasn’t tested for meniér’s since i have no vertigo at all.

should i push for meniér’s diagnosis? keep looking? my neurologist mentioned it could be connected to my complicated migraines as well (i suffer from intense aura migraines). i am extremely scared and locked in a vicious cycle. everyday i fear it will happen again and won’t go away this time. i have lively flashbacks and i can’t deal with normal fleeting tinnitus at all because my heart immediately starts to race and suspects it’s anothe} eepisodw ",2025-10-10 16:32:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o35syn/repeating_sshl/

I don’t know how it is to live with a hearing aid. Can anyone please share what situations/sounds you typically would avoid with conductive hearing aids?

1o1dlv5,HearingLoss,How do I ensure I get taken seriously this time?,"I can't work out whether my hearing loss is getting worse or whether it's the tinnitus causing my problems 

Background:
Woke up one morning and everything seemed to be so loud. (It was the clock ticking that irritated me!) Doctor looked in my ears and said they were blocked. I was given some drops and told if I'm having problems in a few weeks, I'll have my ears syringed.

I had them syringed. I was still having problems with my hearing being too sensitive. I was referred to ENT who diagnosed hyperacusis 

Fast forward 3 years. I noticed I was struggling a lot in noisy places. Spoke to doctor who looked in my ears and decided she couldn't see anything wrong. (No wax, infection, etc)

She sent me to ENT who did a hearing test and decided I couldn't be hearing impaired because I'm sight impaired. (Which makes zero sense. I know at least 2 people with both hearing and sight impairments both because of syndromes they have)

Referred to audiology. He asked me a few questions. One being about any medicine I'm on. He then decided the reason for my hearing loss is most likely because of my medication and auditory processing disorder 

I saw a letter from him which said I have mild sensorineural hearing loss. I wasn't prescribed a hearing aid 

That was 2015/16

I'm struggling again

Dear goodness they just pass you around.  Go back to a different audiologist, or if you’re a Costco member go get a free detailed hearing test.  Hearing can deteriorate frequently so it’s recommended to get hearing tested every two years.  If you do indeed have hearing loss you don’t want to not have a hearing aid, it can really cause processing problems and some studies have shown an increased risk of dementia because of it. When you make the appointment with the audiologist state you want a detailed hearing test done.  

I’m had a similar thing happen to me at a huge medical place, the audiologist basically did a quick look a very fast test and said I have some hearing loss and shoved me out the door.

1o18vt5,HearingLoss,7week old not responding to sounds although he passed AABR,"So my 7week old son initially failed his AABR newborn hearing screening that was taken at the hospital. Since it was a C section, I was told that it was common to fail. But I was very much worried and scared as he was not responding even to the loudest sounds. He is a post term baby 41+1 day delivered. The following day he passed the test before discharge. We felt very happy and relaxed. Then I asked the technician why is he not reacting to sounds.I was told to wait as he was just out of womb. And now even during his 7th week he’s still the same with 0 reaction(awake and asleep) even to the loudest sounds. He tracks visually following everything and he’s growing well in other aspects except this. When I mentioned this to our ped, they arranged for a full ABR soon. I really don’t understand how a baby can pass AABR if one has a serious hearing problem. What are the chances of getting a pass in result even when it’s not? I m trying to remain hopeful and positive thinking he might pass full ABR as well just like AABR. Did you hear any cases where hospital staff intentionally passes by manipulating the results?

[댓글]
So, we actually just had this happen for a kiddo! At our hospital .The difference was they failed the newborn hearing screen. Passed an in depth diagnostic ABR but we had concerns and brought them back for follow up. And man, our instincts were good because they just developed a hearing loss. Turns out, the family has the genetics for a progressive hearing loss. Repeat ABR showed the progression and now we're getting hearing aids now.

Progressive hearing loss can happen at quite literally any point in life. False screener results on an AABR are pretty low, but it could have happened. It could be something else entirely, such as transient fluid coming and going. 

Overall, you're making the right call with testing and you'll get more in depth answers at that appointment!

The kiddo case at your hospital- was the kid able to respond to sounds when passed the in depth diagnostic ABR for the first time? 
physically seeing baby’s reaction to sounds vs passing the Automated ABR - will there be any conflicts?",2025-10-08 12:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o18vt5/7week_old_not_responding_to_sounds_although_he/
1o14nrr,HearingLoss,ADHD meds &amp; hearing loss,"I came across an old post about ADHD medications and hearing loss, and it inspired me to share my own experience.

As a hearing-impaired person myself, I feel the struggle is real. It’s hard to fully trust my psychiatrist when he says these medications are completely safe. Linking side effects like hearing loss to a drug is medically tricky, so potential risks are rarely mentioned in drug info.

For me, my hearing loss is of unknown origin—eventually diagnosed as sensorineural—and I’ve been living with it for over 16 years. During this time, it worsened twice. My hearing further declined during periods when I was taking SNRIs and SSRIs, but I was also exposed to louder situations and experienced acute stress and depression during these times, so it’s even harder to determine what exactly caused the change—the “band-aid” drugs, the conditions themselves, or occasional noise exposure.

I feel frustrated knowing that some people never experience such issues, even partying every day or playing in rock bands. I also occasionally tried unlabelled stimulants like amphetamines—before my ADHD diagnosis, I was a DJ and experimented a few times before starting methylphenidate prescribed by my doctor. I only played occasionally, for short periods, and I generally tried to limit myself in music production—like 7 hours a week max, with long breaks between sessions. It’s always been a struggle because of my executive function challenges.

Doctors say it’s hard to prove a link, so ADHD meds are considered “safe”—but I don’t fully trust it. Many drugs feel potentially ototoxic to me, so I’m extremely cautious.

Still, I’m at a point where I need to start medication again because my ADHD makes functioning very difficult this time of year.

I’m curious—has anyone else experienced anything similar? Did you ever find a link between ADHD meds and hearing issues? And are you also a musician with hearing aids? I make beats and songs and still bedroom DJ (I stopped enjoying the scene simply), so I’d love to hear if anyone has struggled with similar issues. Please let me know, hmu, or whatever :) I’d be happy to chat about similar struggles or exchange perspectives.",2025-10-08 08:13:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1o14nrr/adhd_meds_hearing_loss/

1o05nkt,HearingLoss,Toddler hearing loss,"Hi - my 3 yo son has always seemed to speak with a really loud speaking voice - his indoor voice is most people’s outdoor voice. Speech has been on time, language is advanced. About 2 mths ago i noticed he had started to say “huh? What?” constantly and definitely struggles in background noise and when he can’t see the speaker. Anyway - he failed his hearing screening (i requested it at the 3 yr well visit - it’s usually done at 4yrs), mild-moderate loss in his L ear. I am not surprised but i am confused and concerned because he’s had maybe 2 total ear infections in his life? It seems like toddler hearing loss is usually attributed to recurrent infections/fluid in the middle ear. No wax build up, no current infection, no fluid per ped.

What could be the cause? If there is fluid on a more thorough exam but no infection/history of infection, would they give him tubes? If not fluid obviously there will be more testing etc. We have audiology scheduled in a week. Idk I’m just putting this into the world to see if anyone has experienced anything similar. I work in an adjacent field to audiology but only work with adults, so i have a little more insight/understanding but this doesn’t seem to fit the usual picture. Thanks! 

FWIW i dont believe it was a false failed screen and he’ll do fine on the aud exam. He definitely can’t hear (to some extent) *sigh.*

They offered oral steroids or injections in the ear. I opted for the oral but upon looking up the side effects I’m rethinking and maybe the injections are better. For those who have had the injections, how painful are they?  Please advise. 

[댓글]
Not at all. A little disorienting when the liquid goes in, and you may be dizzy for a few minutes (just had mine done about 4 weeks ago).

I did both oral prednisone and the three injections

Normally not at all. However for me, I was treated at a teaching hospital so mostly was done by students. Most were good so no discomfort, but a few were not good so lots of pain.

Very not painful. My doctor told me most patients opt not to have any numbing agent on the follow-up doses so I opted out on the first dose. Slight discomfort as it first goes in, then feels like getting water squirted in your ear while swimming. 10 seconds at most then lay your head on its side for 30 minutes without swallowing.

YMMV

They’re not supposed to hurt. Yet when I needed them, my doctor was afraid for me because I was the only who had pain with the injection.

they are just as effective as the pills. there is no point in that.",2025-10-06 21:22:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nzvvgz/steroid_injections_in_ears_how_painful_are_they/

gradually the ringing got more and more noticeable and i started to lose my hearing. now i have constant ringing in my ears(which i know is tinnitus), but am still confused about the hearing loss aspect of this. the best way i can explain this is that my ear feels full all the time- like i need to pop it but i can’t. when i close my good ear and try to listen to something, its all muffled, and sometimes if im listening to music and i do this the pitch gets all weird. the ringing is annoying as all hell but i know that isn’t going away. I also had some bouts of dizziness but those have thankfully gone away. I also rarely have any pain anymore in my ears. 
I’ve had my ears cleaned and earwax was ruled out, so has menieres disease. any help would be much appreciated because i’m at a loss of what to do.

many Noises Hurt, crackle, muddy everything else.  
I can't understand voices well unless they yell (painful) or i'm in a quiet environment.   
  
Tinnitus, Very high pitched ringing constant and steady.  Its been 6 months now. 

Hearing aids are pricey, but I was told they might help the tinnitus. 

I bought Airpods Pro 2 - Just waiting for them to arrive. Any advice on their setup? do you think it'll help my case at all or make my brain STFU and stop overreacting to sounds?

Thanks.  I'm sure as with a lot of you... I'm so incredibly frustrated, depressed.

Strongly suggest biofeedback and/or mindfulness exercises to help you RELAX in the presence of your tinnitus. Your brain WILL adapt to the sound

My tinnitus in my right ear is very reactive.

I have found that when I get home, if I put my (audiogram adjusted) airpods in, the tinnitus calms down quite quickly to baseline (minutes). If I don't do this, it takes a few hours to calm down.

I haven't tried wearing them in a busy place yet, but this is my next step.

Gah. I got them. When I put them in, in our living room with my severely adhd daughter humming, tv going and wife talking, range top fan going  - sudden peace.  Far better than ear plugs. I cried. It was very unexpected. 

Followed by frustration as I couldn’t find the hearing aid function. Trying to update them, only realizing after hours that they’re blocked from being used as hearing aids in Canada. 

So frustrating.",2025-10-06 15:53:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nzmx23/airpodspro_2_vs_3_and_overall_effectiveness/

1nz2k7m,HearingLoss,Is hearing up to 14.5khz for a 30yr old normal?,"Hello! Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this question. Was just curious!

Backstory: I damaged my eardrum, never got a hole in it, just a burn, have tinnitus now, eardrum is healed. Ear is still sensitive to loud sounds. I have a hearing test in July 2026 to test to see if any inner ear hairs were damaged. Going on month 3 for Tinnitus btw. It started 6 days after the injury. I was exposed to saw noises during healing while wearing non-noise cancelling headphones. Anyways, back story over.

I used this video: https://youtu.be/MGKHw7Kr-RM?si=H5y3qyJeew5yyO4m

Was actually trying to find my tinnitus frequency since it's tonal. Had my headphones on, half volume as that's all I can stand right now, I was in a bathroom, walls were brick. Think super old school where interior was mostly brick walls with thick doors. Had door closed to make it as quiet as possible. Now I have zero clue how to find my T frequency and this post isn't about that. I realised while trying to do that video I could hear all the way up to 14,500 Hz, once 15khz hit I heard nada.

I'm just curious if this is normal for my age? Google says 30 should be able to hear up to 16khz, tech people at church say it's normal for my age. Might as well ask for opinions here too lol. I read online if the hairs are damaged you usually lose the ability to hear high frequencies first. Among other things like balance is off, hard to hear speech, fullness feels, tinnitus, etc.

I can hear high frequencies (I didn't really notice ""silence"" anywhere in that video cept at the very beginning and at 15khz beyond), have Tinnitus but no other ""inner hairs damaged"" side effects. Now, it is hard for me to hear others talk in loud situations - when I am vacuuming, when many others are talking at once around me and person is a little ways from me that is talking to me. I tend to repeat back what they said bc I feel I may have incorrectly heard, sometimes I am correct sometimes I am not. It did list ""difficultly hearing others in loud situations"" so ig I have that too. But I feel if I did truly damage inner ear hairs high frequencies would hardly be there and be the first to go. So, ig my point of asking this question of if hearing up to 14.5khz for a 30yr old is normal is my small way of giving myself hope nothing beyond my eardrum was damaged. I hate that my hearing test to check for damage is next year... Yes I am aware only an Audiologist can tell me if these hairs are damaged. I am just curious since it said high frequencies go first in hearing loss/inner hairs damaged. Again sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this!

Sorry for the long post too, probably wasn't nessesary...

You don't have hearing loss

There tends to be alot of variation in sensitivity to the extended high frequency range in different individuals. As such it's my understanding that ""normal"" thresholds aren't as well defined above 8k (which is highest frequencies most audiologists test at).

Don't be too concerned about it. It's possible that your headphones don't reproduce much content above 14k, or some other element in your audio chain is filtering them out. Even if you can only hear up to 14k it's not really a big problem as far as your hearing goes. 

Do get proper audiometric testing though. That will help identify real problems. 

Online DIY tests aren't that reliable.",2025-10-05 22:47:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nz2k7m/is_hearing_up_to_145khz_for_a_30yr_old_normal/

is this for real? you don’t just randomly go deaf from clubbing, do you have any hearing tests or anything to substantiate this fear, any prior loss …. anything ? this is so off the bat out of the blue

Respectfully, unless you’ve noticed a loss in hearing, you’re being paranoid. 

That being said, it’s a good moment for you to take your hearing health seriously and get some quality earplugs for when you’re in these loud environments.

Get some loop earplugs to protect your hearing and enjoy yourself (responsibly). Consider getting some therapy or meds to address the anxiety you are carrying.

Your reasons are not totally unfonded as others say in here. You are not paranoid. Ringing ears means ear fatigue. I worked a lot with music (production, mixing, etc), and I do have hearing problems. The damage to your inner ear is cumulative. You have some nerve cells with small hairs that are specialized in sensing different sound frequencies. They move with the sound. Blasting sound at them, it damages little by little. I bet you are young now, but when you going to reach 50 I think is gonna be tricky. You should avoid going so often in clubs. I'm not saying stop for good, but you went often. More than enough.",2025-10-05 14:06:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nyp4z4/am_i_certain_to_be_deaf_now/

You lost high frequencies. It may be age (if you are overe 40-50) or cumulative loud sound damage. I would trade my audiograms with yours any day, but is not looking good. Those lines must be flat in all frequencies. Down to the line of 20dB is considered ""normal"". What's under that not so much.

I'm 17 btw

Your audiologist will try to sell you $4,000-$7,000 hearing aids. If you feel you need them at all, try OTC aids for under $300 first.

Do you have any concerns for hearing loss? Did she use headphones? you mention the ear being swollen, which sometimes headphones can push down on the ear and worsen the high frequencies.

There is mild-moderate hearing loss in both ears, but the air conduction in the left ear is especially bad, indicating conductive hearing loss.

Hearing aids. Is she already using them bilaterally - definitely needed if not. 

What is the cause? Has she seen an ENT or only an audiologist? If not, needs an ENT review to further diagnose the cause(s).

1ny8srf,HearingLoss,I was told hearing aids would not help for high-frequency hearing loss. Is this true?,"I'm 40yo and had my first hearing test today after noticing that I've been asking my wife and children to repeat themselves more frequently than normal. The test showed moderate to severe hearing loss specifically in the high-frequency spectrum.  
  
I'm a lifelong musician so I was not surprised at all, since the pattern is consistent with noise-induced hearing loss.

The technician said hearing aids at this point would not be helpful since my hearing in the lower frequencies is still quite good so they would feel much to noisy for me on a day-to-day basis. 

After doing some research of my own it seems that it's not so farfetched to get hearing aids that specifically amplify some portion of the frequency spectrum but it's also very difficult to tell fact from fiction since these hearing aids companies make all kinds of claims.

So I came here to get thoughts and opinions from real people that have perhaps gone through this themselves and can confirm whether I should start looking at some hearing aid options this early in the game, or just hold and continue monitoring via annual checkups until things get noticeably worse.

Thanks in advance!

I’m an audiologist and would definitely recommend you try hearing aids. They should make things sound a lot sharper and clearer for you, and it’s better for your cognitive health to keep the auditory system stimulated with sound rather than missing out on a load of high frequency sound for years and years. Most places should offer a trial period of sorts during which you can return the hearing aids for a refund if you’re not happy with them. So I say give it a try

That person gave you bad advice. Try them. You’ll need something with good noise management and a vented dome.

Yeah you can. My graph is like yours but a bit worse. They help a ton.

Hello! I also have high frequency loss but in the mild and moderate area. I’ve been demo hearing aids the last two weeks to decide which to purchase. It is quite strange to me that they said they wouldn’t be helpful. I would definitely go get a second opinion from an audiologist. I’m curious to know what sort of place this specialist was from? 

An audiologist can program your hearing aids so that only the high frequencies you are missing out on come through and your low frequency hearing still remaining can be heard as usual. My biggest reason for getting hearing aids is keeping those high frequency nerves stimulated. There are a lot of studies coming out about the connection between dementia and hearing loss too so it’s important to keep those ear nerves in use. Overall I would recommend searching around for a good audiologist. Hope this helps and good luck to you!

I have very similar hearing loss (high frequencies are basically gone for me) and I have hearing aids lol. Get them! I will say though that the high frequencies can be jolting at times as they’re too loud sometimes. But overall, my speech perception is night and day with and without them.

i have hearing aids for hf and they changed my life - you deff could bennifit

ehhhh yes and no. you cant correct poor frequencies without compromising the normal frequencies. you have to decide if that is better or worse for you. id see if you could trial hearing aids

I had them… stopped wearing them as they really didn’t help… audiologist said my hearing loss outpaced what hearing aids could do… my loss is high frequency

My loss in my right ear is HF Loss, and my hearing aid makes a huge difference for me. However, every case is different. I suggest you get a second opinion from an audiologist associate with an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist. They see all kinds of hearing problems and know which ones need more than a hearing aid. 

I went to a couple of those that send you free offers in the mail and advertised on TV and they couldn’t help me. When I went to the ENT Audiologist, I was hearing better than I had in 25 years before I left the office.

Yeah I'd be giving them a try. They may help you quite a bit.

Also - if you have tinnitus (?) - they may help dampen it down as well.

ETA one of my ears has a loss similar to yours (the other is mostly fine) - I have tried the AirPods and do think they help somewhat, and moderately lessen the tinnitus (particularly after a reactive 'flair').

It's definitely still worth a try. A big try.

I have very mild high frequency loss and I LOVE the way they make everything sound more crisp. I can function without them but they really do help me ignore the tinnitus. It's still there but every day I feel my brain acclimating back to normal since the signal isn't missing anymore

I'm also a musician (fiddler) with some high end hearing loss and a whole bunch of related tinnitus. Hearing aids absolutely still help for upper end stuff. There are some big limitations on how much hearing aids can help over 8kHz (annoying for me, since my tinnitus is pitched at about 11k), but given your chart you'll likely still get huge benefit from the 2k to 8k band.

Its your ear. Don't let them do anything you're not comfortable with. And tell them firmly - 'this was not discussed with me previously.' The ear is delicate and every procedure carries significant risks.

Before the aids, she was bringing home good grades on spelling tests and now she is bringing home D's. It is very unlike her.

my concern is the “good to fair” reliability. are they 1000% sure there is a hearing loss?

There is an adjustment period. When you first get hearing aids EVERYTHING is louder. I used to teach elementary school and my phone would routinely give me the “you’re in a loud environment” warnings just during regular class. She could be overwhelmed. Also, it looks like she has the same sort of hearing loss I do, has anyone referred to it as a “cookie bite” chart? It’s less common, the shape of her chart with the dip in the middle. Best of luck, it’s great that you are already helping her ❤️

No, is always getting worse. Never better. (If we talk about sensorineural hearing loss, damage in the inner ear).

this is still 100% within normal limits, you do
have a small notch but it’s still normal right now , make sure you protect your ears and get some hearing protection, honestly one or two shots of a gun by your ear without Nd you’d likely be toast,

Depends a lot of your age.
I can see a mild 4khz dip related to noise exposure, but clinically your hearing is functional and within normal ranges; speech is not affected if synapses are okay.
If you are young (18-25) then it may indicate a slightly below average hearing but very functional, maybe some minor degree of premature loss but if you take care of your hearing, avoid loud sounds, you will be okay even when you get older. Just avoid loud sounds, and you will be okay.

Its normal hearing but its Just the little notch at like 3-4khz... Are u a fan of listening loud music? On earphones or headphones? Since those frequencies pretty much always mean its because of loud noise and ur only 20 which is very early to see notches in ur hearing

Totally normal. Your audiologist needs to retrain.

Sincerely,
An audiologist

so far, you have amazing hearing! however, they are seeing a notch (still well within normal limits) that matches noise damage. if you do not start protecting your ears, you COULD end up with noise induced hearing loss, based on the pattern in your audiogram

I got a hearing aid (for my left ear only) 10 years ago after noticing I was struggling to hear people at work. I had to get an MRI done as well because they said it was unusual to have one-sided hearing loss at my age (45). Although there is apparently very slight loss in the right ear as well.

I feel like I did this to myself as I used to blast the car stereo and also have my headphones at too high a volume. I can't believe I was so stupid and just didn't think I could be harming my ears.  The MRI didn't find anything so I'm not sure if there is another reason other than loud music, I'm not sure why my left ear would be the only one affected though.

My first hearing aid was quite effective but I've had nothing but problems when I needed to replace it. I tried one with a wire instead of a tube and it was great as wouldn't get blocked with wax and I didn't have to muck around with batteries. However, I still struggled to hear and despite going back to the audiologist several times, it just felt like I wasn't wearing one so I went back to a tubed one.

I still struggle, especially in a loud cafe and/or in a group setting. I often have to turn it down to cope with the background noise, but then often can't hear people. Also at work I still can't hear people that well if they are across the aisle from me.  I also really struggle with foreign accents, my father was in hospital and I'd have to ring for updates and dreaded it when someone with an accent answered, it made me feel awful for hoping I'd get someone who wasn't foreign.

I feel that I still miss out on so much, I don't normally wear my hearing aid at home as get tired of it, but then am always asking my family to repeat themselves, but even with it on, there are so many times when I still can't hear people. I'm really hoping the gene therapy experiments to re-grow inner ear hair will be successful within the next decade.

Just came back from the doctors office, she said my ear drum is ok, did a hearing test which was difficult for me because of the ringing, doctor says i have some bleeding which indicates an injury in the inner ear and mucus in my tube.

She prescribed me heavy dose of steroids and said its a 50% chance of hearing recovery and that the ringing might stay with me forever, im terrified it stays this way, its been a nightmare.

Id like to know if anyone experienced this, the ringing comes from my tubes being full of mucus? Or the injury? Is there anything else i should try or look into?

I suffered from chronic sinusitis all my life. I think that this also affected my hearing. That nose cavities and ears apparatus are next to each other.

I got permanent tinnitus from bilateral otitis media with effusion and bacterial sinus infection. 


How were your otoacoustic emissions test?

Could be the injury, damage to the inner ear - specially to the inner ear hairs, definitely is hearing loss as those do not grow back. This can cause tinnitus - what you have. I have tinnitus too, due to injury on eardrum - going on 3 months. Ur lucky u even got a hearing test! Mine to test for inner ear hairs damage isn't until July 2026... I have to wait to see if my tinnitus is due to inner ear hair damage OR linked to my emotions. The more negative u react to the noise, the more ur brain will think it's a threat and ""watch"" for it amplifying the sound. Ur teaching ur brain u wanna hear it by giving the noise that reaction. Crickets playing constantly when ik it'll be a quiet place or be vacuuming help me currently. If u need to vacuum, I highly suggest having something playing for when u turn it off. A vacuum acts as masking and when it stops ur brain goes to the closest noise, this being ur tinnitus. Don't let it do that if possible. 


Tinnitus Relief App is what I use btw. Try ur best to distract urself, teach urself it's not a threat. When u hear it, start humming do anything to try to teach ur brain ur not interested. Try ur best not to react negativily to it - easier said then done. Expect anxiety and depression to hit hard first few months. Do things that make u happy, might wanna avoid caffeine (my first soda a month ago cause my T to amplify sending me into a panic attack, gonna give it another shot after this month) You're not alone in this. Most recent advice given to me: if I wake up during the night, listen to my breathing and focus on that, take deep breathes. Has helped me fall back asleep. 


I use an Alexa echo dot under my bed playing ""Rain sounds"" by sleep jar volume 4 for when I roll over away from my crickets. Ear on pillow WILL amplify the noise. Try having some noise under ur pillow for when u roll over in ur sleep.  Maybe try to convince urself it's just *insert similar noise here* to help reduce the negative reaction. Currently trying to convince myself it's just the electric noise of my TV/iMac whatever electronic is near me to reduce my slight anxiety to hearing it when I do. The point of this is to convince ur brain it's not a threat and to start ignoring it, or least decreasing the volume of it so it feels like it's ""gone"". 
Some days are good, some days are depressed filled. Last weekend had a depressive day. Am okay today. One step at a time. It will be okay. Eat lots of Magnesium, B12 and B6 high things to recover faster. Good vitamins for ears. I personally ate a lot of liver and Spinach and had a vitamin water - The kiwi strawberry has all 3 of those vitamins - everyday (5ml of caffeine btw, that little amount didn't bother me)

Last advice: DO NOT try ""searching"" for the sound. If you notice it's quieter - like ur surroundings, celebrate but don't try to search for the noise. Be happy u noticing it's ""quiet"" and move on. Searching to see if it's gone tells ur brain to amplify the noise bc it thinks ur trying to listen to it and it feels ""silly"" for making it a lower volume.

1nwmh3l,HearingLoss,"Help! Heard a loud cracker, now can’t hear properly","It happened last night, about 12 hours ago. Children were bursting crackers back to back, and there was this big one (literally called a ""Nazi bomb"" because of how loud it is).

I felt fine for about an hour, both ears seemed to be working normally, but after 2 hours my right ear started to feel “full” or kind of “void.” It still feels that way now, and I’ve lost maybe 40–50% of my hearing in that ear. As for ringing, I only notice it if I tightly close my left ear.

Is this normal, or should I go to the hospital?

I would go to the ER. The emergency treatment is high dose steroids and hours count.

Don't leave without getting the steroids. Some have commented they just wanted to refer them to an ENT, but it can take a long time to get an appointment. Insist, go into Karen mode, whatever.

I had a similar injury from an automobile airbag.

Personally I didn't get much improvement but I am older (64m) and had some preexisting hearing loss. It varies a lot. There are a couple other treatments like steroid injections through the eardrum and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). I did the injections but wasn't offered the HBOT. I did get a lot of  improvement in tinnitus and that feeling of fullness but not much improvement in hearing.

1nwlkpt,HearingLoss,Asking for help/potential hearing loss,"Hi all! 

I hope this is acceptable for this group and hope that this post comes off as I wish it to. 
My husband and I are expecting our first child in February. A baby boy that we are so excited to welcome. 
We found out today through genetic testing that our son has a 25% chance of developing DFNB1. My husband and I are both hearing and our families have no history of hearing loss. 
As an expectant mother, I want to prepare myself the best I can in the event that our son does have some hearing loss. I am completely uneducated when it comes to this, and a lot of the online research I have done is too scientific and not real life based (if this makes sense). 
I know that I will need to understand the science behind everything and I am working on this. But if anyone has any other educational resources or advice as to prepare myself for his potential hearing loss. 
I am planning to educate myself regardless, as this is something that I could need for potential future children if our son winds up not having hearing loss. 

If this is not allowed - or if any of this is worded incorrectly or offensively - please educate me. I am only trying to understand, educate myself, and figure out the best plan forward for my son. I appreciate the advice and the kindness. ",2025-10-03 01:04:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nwlkpt/asking_for_helppotential_hearing_loss/
1nwiujz,HearingLoss,My run in with tinnitus caused from the in door gun range,"Well what a long story I have for you guys. I’m 23(m) and here’s how I developed tinnitus. I love to go in door shooting at the gun range. Usually I wear ear muffs where I go but this time I wanted to wear ear plugs. In my head I thought I would be fine and it was an another day at the gun range for me but I would get to learn I was totally wrong. 
We decided to shoot 100 rounds of a Glock 9 and 100 rounds of a high caliber 45.  At the very end of shooting I noticed my left ear plugs was not in my ear all the way and was just sitting in my ear. I didn’t think much of it tbh as I didn’t know the damage I caused yet. 

Right after shooting as we are about to leave I take my ear plugs out and both of my ears were ringing which never happened to me before. In my head I was like just give it a couple hours I’ll be fine. A hour passed and the ringing went away in my left air but but my right ear was still ringing. I was like maybe I just need some sleep and it will go away. The next morning I wake up and it’s still ringing. I didn’t think much of it and just continued my day but that’s until I finally understood the damage I caused.Normal things I am used to hearing were really muffled and some of the loud sounds would hurt my ear. I got really scared and started searching up what it could be and tbh that scared me even more. 2 days went by and the was ringing even louder and i was scared shitless. I didn’t know what to do I felt depressed and even cried at one point. I kept reading that it’s not curable an I really messed up my ear having lifetime ringing in my ear.

I eventually was so scared I went to see a ent doctor. I didn’t hearing test and they noticed my right ear wasn’t able to hear the same things as my left ear. After the test the ent doctor seamed my ear and said I alot of inflammation in my ear. I caused acoustic tramua to ear but luckily my ear drum was protected. She offered a steroid to take to lower inflammation but did tell me to give it two weeks as it’s not necessary really which I did refuse the steroid. 

It’s been 10 days since I went shooting and tbh with you I have learned to live with this ringing. After first I was very sad and upset at myself for doing this but I have learned that there’s way more important things to worry about as I still can hear out of my ears. The ringing has died down significantly as it was very loud from the start. Sometimes I can even hear the ringing anymore but when it does become quiet I can hear it perfectly. I can hear perfectly fine out of both of my ears and they don’t hurt with loud noise anymore. The doctor did tell me that this ringing can be permanent but to always think postive. I distract myself a lot and I don’t hear it that much. I will keep you guys updated throughout my journey as this is a very scary thing to deal with tbh. I have my next doctor visit coming up soon too.",2025-10-02 22:59:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nwiujz/my_run_in_with_tinnitus_caused_from_the_in_door/

1nwc3bk,HearingLoss,just smashed a plate on the floor and it was extremely loud...feeling so anxious now about potential set back,"so I was just cleaning up my kitchen and accidentally knocked a tray from waist height with a china bowl on it on to my tile kitchen floor which smashed behind me. The sound was felt EXTREMELY loud and seemed to go on for quite a while (long enough that even with a delayed response I had time to cover my ears with hands towards the end) hi

Im struggling to tell whether my hearing is feeling damaged or not. I think that it feels somewhat slightly more muffled and my ears feel like hot if that makes any sense? Also my ear fluttering in one ear has come back with a vengeance.

Im so pissed off cos I normally wear earplugs in the kitchen but just forgot this one time and ive been so good recently about it too ugh.

Is it likely that the loudness from something like this will have caused a major set back? Do I need to go get my hearing checked from a specialist?

Its so frustrating cos I had almost the same thing happen at the beginning of the year (although that time one of my ears literally went like quiet for 5-10 seconds when it happened which this time did not), and I then had to take weeks/months to get feeling confident again.

Its just beyond annoying as im a musician and ive got a project that I was literally in the middle of right now that I need to get done and now feel like I shouldn't listen to anything for a long time ffs.

Do any of you have any advice or tips on how I should help myself right now in terms of resting/recovering or whether maybe im over reacting or not? (I also have fairly major health anxiety too to top it all off)

thanks :/ x",2025-10-02 18:39:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nwc3bk/just_smashed_a_plate_on_the_floor_and_it_was/
1nw79xr,HearingLoss,"7 days ago, daughter screamed in my left ear, blasted my cochlea -25db, and left me with constant tinnitus.","1. This happened 7 days ago. Went to Urgent care after 24 hours and started 60mg prednisone, no effect. Went to ENT on day 6 (yesterday) and received intratympanic injection, no effect so far. Anything else I should be considering?

2. When they ran the DPOAE on that ear it shows little to no response for a wide range of frequencies, which makes me think those areas of my cochlea are wiped out and the steroid-type treatments probably aren’t going anywhere. Am I off track?

3. Anything hopeful in this audiogram?

4. The tinnitus is a high pitched ringing. Maskable with the right ambient sounds nearby (clothes dryer, shower/sink, comedy routines played on my phone’s speaker). Can’t seem to mask with headphones or AirPods but I have been very conservative with exposing myself to anything loud again.

5. Just trying to make sure I cover all bases while I’m still near the onset, blunt information is welcome.

Yes, see an ENT

The amount of loss is related to the volume (loudness) and duration of the sound. The mic feedback was likely no more than a few seconds and probably not as loud as some other harmful sounds like guns. So, chances are you will have minimal to no permanent damage.

I am not a doctor, so if you want to play it safe, go see a doctor who will likely prescribe prednisone.

1nvrtd6,HearingLoss,Advise needed!,"Hey all need some reddit advise. I am looking to buy a backup pair of hearing aids ""not AirPods"" and here is what I am thinking. I can get a like new pair of Phillips Hearlink 9050's from Ebay, but the concern is programming. I did call a few audiologist today and they stated that they do not have the Phillips software because they are only Costco, the other option is to try and DYI program them myself. Phillips allows the public to download the software and there are a few YouTube videos showing what to do this would be about an $800 dollar total investment. The other option I am looking at is a like brand new pair of Oticon Intent 1's that were used only 1x . We know that any audiologist can program them. This investment would be $1100. I have tried the Elehear Beyond and the were not good, and the Lexie B2 do not have great reviews at $1000 nor do the Sennhisier all day clear esp by golf who have to wear Rx hearing aids daily to get by. Would I be getting over my head trying to program the Phillips myself? I am pretty tech savvy.

Get something more ""normal"" so you can be able to program it with a Noahlink interface. Get a ReSound, or a Phonak.

For a backup pair, I'd honestly skip all the programming headaches and just grab something OTC. I'm using a pair of audien and they're already FDA-registered, has pre-set modes, and cost only $600. They’re not fancy, but they do the job when my main pair’s charging or at the audiologist. Not fancy but at least if something happens to your main pair, you've got something that just works.

You can get an OTC aid as a back up, they are an affordable option. I have the Resound Vivia (RIC) model and when I am tired wearing them I switch to using Heardirectclub Nova aids. Their in-ear design makes them comfortable and light for daily wear.",2025-10-02 02:24:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nvrtd6/advise_needed/

You are too soon to judge them, your brain is now processing sounds it hasn't heard in years, it doesn't know which to tune out yet. Voices will still be hard until your brain learns to reprocess the sounds. Your hearing aids will help, but it does take time to adjust to them. 

Just wear them as often as possible, you will find it becomes easier to understand, and everything will get much less overwhelming as you become used to them.

It took me 3-4 months to really get used to them each time I’ve gotten a new pair.  I agree, wear them as often as you can to help.

My audiologist gradually increased the volume over the first few weeks. Said my brain would take time to stop enhancing the missing frequencies.",2025-10-02 00:09:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nvoy4g/resources_for_new_hearing_aid_user/

1nvhnaf,HearingLoss,"Normal audiogram, but my hearing is terrible, confused","Introduction and context:

In December 2024, I had a cold that left me very congested. I noticed a slight difficulty hearing that attributed it to the cold since yawning improved my hearing

Since then, I noticed that my hearing wasn't quite right (i suspect some auto inflicted damage due to done valsalva when i was still very congested). 
I had an audiogram done that same month, which showed I had low-frequency hearing loss due to blocked tubes (type b tympanogran). A bilateral symmetrical drop of 35 dB at 8 kHz also appeared, which alerted my ENT doctor, who told me to come back in 6 months to monitor that.

In May 2025, I contracted what I suspect was COVID. I was in bed for 2 weeks, unable to get up due to the weakness, dizziness, nausea, and cough I had.
All of this left me with severe congestion in both ears, which gradually subsided, although I noticed my left ear still felt blocked.

This happened far from home, so when I returned, I used my tone generator and noticed I had slightly lost hearing between 5 and 6 kHz, and it also affected higher frequencies.

Since it was too late for corticosteroid therapy, I left it alone and bet that since it was mild, I would recover, at least a little.

June/August 2025: Indeed, the loss improved and my treble returned to a decent level. I was happy.

One day, after exerting myself physically trying to fix and then install a door in my house, I noticed a sensation of blocked ears and muffled hearing. I thought it was due to all the work I'd done and the use of the drill, so I didn't take any action.

Days passed, I didn't improve. So I went to my ENT doctor, who dismissed it and sent me home with a prescription for nasal spray and an order for an MRI.

September 2025: My hearing continues to worsen. I notice my highs are fading more and more each day (and the tone generator is becoming difficult to hear above 5 kHz, especially in my left ear). I have trouble hearing crickets and birds. The F, S, and T notes have become unclear. People sound like they have a potato in their mouth when they speak, especially women.

Last week, I went back to my ENT doctor and, while I was there, I had an appointment with the audiologist who works with him.

I had another audiogram, tympanogram, speechgram, etc.
To my surprise, the results were completely normal, even better than in December. Remember the 8 kHz drop at 35 dB? Well, now it's 20 dB in my left ear and 15 dB in my right ear, an almost miraculous improvement, I'd say.

After seeing this, my ENT is now insisting more on the MRI and also ordered an electrocochleography, he thinks it might be coclear hydrops or some bad tmj

This whole situation is destroying my psyche. I can't sleep, I can't live.
I'm a habitual hypochondriac, and honestly, I'm living a nightmare, not knowing if I'll wake up tomorrow and not be able to hear anymore.


And I clarify, I have ADHD and I know that this causes problems with sound processing, but I feel that this has nothing to do with it, I am honestly confused.

I think my case is similar, although due to ototoxic medications over the course of a year I have felt like I have lost clarity and sharpness in both ears and my audiometry is also normal.

In general I have not found any problem with my hearing in day to day life and docters tell me not to worry since it's only in 4k ,am worried about my future and want to know will this get a lot worse even if I protect my ears ? I have already started using earplugs in noisy places. Have people with the same audiogram as me continued to have a stable hearing without it worsening over time ?

you don't feel like you're actually hearing less? Great to hear that it doesn't affect your daily life but 60dB HL is already considered moderate-to-severe. I have 60db HL in one ear at 6-8khz and I can feel it every day. Do you have tinnitus?

Very interesting to see a post like this where you have fairly substantial noise induced hearing loss and you essentially didn't even realize it.

I see almost daily posts from others where they have an audiogram that shows hearing in the normal range but they insist they have some kind of severe impairment.

I also had fairly bad hearing loss before I ever began to struggle in day to day life, although I knew my hearing was asymmetric and I couldn't hear as well others, it didn't really affect me until it was quite bad.

Only after I had a stapedectomy did I realize how much I was missing. And even now I have some mild residual hearing loss, I don't think it affects my day to day life much at all.

But it really goes to show how much of this can be psychological.

1nv9h52,HearingLoss,Help / Advice - still having discomfort 80hrs after concert,"Hello, I (37F) was at a loud concert on Saturday night. I was up in the bowl of the arena somewhat near the speakers and also sitting beside this lady who kept yelling to my right. The music was quite loud and I remember at one point thinking “ow that hurts” but I looked around and no one was reacting and I didn’t see anyone around me wearing hearing protection (huge mistake on my part not doing so). Sunday morning hearing was slightly muffled in both ears but no pain. My boyfriend who was beside me the whole time at the concert was fine. By Sunday evening I had a bad throbbing pain in my right ear, painful pressure and feeling of fullness (like when your ears wont pop). Tuesday afternoon (approx 60hrs after concert) when it had not resolved, I went to the doctor and they took a look in both ears - no infection, no fluid in either ear and both ear drums look good. She told me if it doesn’t resolve by Thursday to book in to see an audiologist. I’ve taken Advil cold/sinus and Tylenol which have helped slightly with the pain/pressure. Warm compress, rested ears. I’ve also done facial massage and the valsalva maneuver. The pain has lessened but the feeling of fullness is still quite bothersome. Last night (Tuesday evening) it seemed to lessen a bit as I was sitting on the couch before bed. However I woke up this morning (approx 80 hrs after concert) and it’s back to being the same. I’m quite worried as I read that temporary threshold shifts usually resolve themselves in 48 hrs. But some articles I read said it could last weeks (if it resolves at all)?

1nv9g97,HearingLoss,Infection caused Hearing Loss - 6 months later - No hope for better days,"April - Inner ear infection. Saw GP right away. Nothing they could do, except lead me on a wild goose chase for ""STEC"" medication, which I found out after had nothing to do with infection.

Long story short, Referral to ENT.  

Hearing Loss, in right ear (the one that was infected)  
Certain frequencies HURT. My youngest daughters kind of nasal voice Pains me, especially her laugh. This absolutely breaks my heart.

ENT Said it might get better, not to use ear plugs. I had some auditory sensory things before, but Now I'm just miserable. Conversations can't be had with the TV on. If a place is LOUD (think busy resteraunt) I'm just overwhelmed overall, but can actually hear people I'm with, because they speak up, but am totally trained after. 

Music sucks. I LOVE music. I can't listen to it in the car. It is painful, its not clear. It sounds like I'm listening to a dollar store speaker turned way to loud. 

Will my brain adjust? Will things stop being painful? I don't wear earplugs unless I'm going somewhere like a kids birthday party or a place I know will be very loud. ENT told me if I wore earplugs alot my brain would adjust to that and make it worse without them. 

Below is my hearing test. I honestly think my Left ear dips because of the raging ringing in my right ear at that frequency. I can even ""cope"" with the tinnitus as its regular. I can ignore it. But since April, its been 24/7 with very infrequently changes (like ""Flashbang"" events that happen randomly for no reason, and fade away)

30db is mild hearing loss

I'm right there with you. Mild to severe losses at HF with tinnitus, after an ear infection in April.

I also have a very annoying droning tone in the low frequencies for some reason.

Sigh. It's been life changing. 

Everyone tells me I will adjust in time. I'm hoping so. It's so hard not be depressed about it though.

Mines 55 left ear and very mild to normal right. I get what you’re saying about everything sounding tinny and distorted. I did steroid treatments (oral and injection) with no improvement, my ENT follow up is Tuesday and the audiologist recommended a hearing aid for the left side, just need ENT to give medical clearance since my MRI was normal.

Same thing happened to me... in April, as well, which is quite weird since other users commented on the same. What's weirder is that I live in South America, but if you ask me I'm sure we all caught the same type of virus. Other people down here had the same symptoms and outcomes. Exactly the same procedure from the medics as well, didn't really have a clue, gave me the steroids, etc.",2025-10-01 14:17:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nv9g97/infection_caused_hearing_loss_6_months_later_no/

It’s definitely something to watch. Because of the broadband loss, might be worth working with an ENT to see if it responds to a short burst of prednisone. Not to horrify you but my hearing looked like that in my early 20’s and now I’m down around a 70db threshold in the upper half of the spectrum and around 30 or 40 on the lower half. That might not be the case for you, just watch it. Make sure your diet and exercise are on point, no major nutritional gaps, and pay attention to whether certain types of common allergenic foods make it worse.

I don't know if that really looks like noise induced hearing loss. Somebody more knowledgeable than random redditors would probably know better.

I think you might have to just wait and see. If and when the hearing loss progresses a more definitive diagnosis could be made. At this stage it might be hard to tell. 

Could be a middle ear thing? There's a small air bone gap at a couple frequencies that might get larger if there is some kind of disorder causing conductive loss. 

Right now it's not too bad and whatever problem you have might develop very slowly, you should try not to obsess over this. 

If it's from noise exposure, and in the future you protect your hearing from noise, then the progression should slow down or stop altogether. If it's a congenital condition then it will continue.

Hi there. Have you been exposed to loud music or something? Why did you go and get your ears checked in first placed? What kind of symptoms do you have besides having troubles understanding people?

Is this significant to be classified as a hearing loss? I have a kind of similar level in pure tone audiometry. My OAE tests are also passed for both ears. My audiologist did an ABR test and concluded that I am having ANSD which leads to poor speech understanding in background noise.

You probably have noise induced hidden hearing loss, very common on people that used to crank music volume (I regret doing that..), which isnt easy to diagnose for most ENTs and audiologists. Most of them doesn't even know about it.

I have almost the same result as you (-35dB in the 6000s and 8000s in both ears) and I have hyperacusis.

My advice would be to pay attention to the volume and the duration of exposure (headphones, video games, etc.). If you can eliminate headphones, that would be even better because they're terrible for your ears.

I'd also recommend buying custom-made hearing protection and wearing them in noisy places.

The rule is simple: if you have to raise your voice to be heard, that's the ideal time to protect yourself.",2025-10-01 11:58:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nv679g/how_bad_is_this_at_19/

What is hidden hearing loss?",2025-09-30 23:57:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nuta9r/research/
1nuhevt,HearingLoss,"Feeling depressed despite a rather ""harmless"" audiogram","I've already posted my audiogram some time ago, many replies said it is normal hearing. Ever since, my hearing has even worsened, so I attach updated audiograms for you (to add: not taken by audiologist, but by an app on my smartphone, though it seems quite accurate comparing earlier hearing tests by audiologists). Depicted are pure tone audiometry and speech in noise audiometry. I can still follow most conversations except sitting in the backseat of a car while the people on frontseats are talking. But the hearing of the left ears is dull and muffled and my thoughts are on it nearly every minute I'm awake since this is a condition I can hardly accept. I will soon contact an audiologist again in order to do another hearing test and query whether hearing aids might be helpful, though I'd be grateful to receive any comments.

Having difficulty following a conversation when you’re sitting behind the people speaking in a loud environment is … pretty much normal. 

I would give one of my kidneys to have a word recognition score like that.

You are experiencing mental health issues.

&gt;my thoughts are on it nearly every minute I'm awake since this is a condition I can hardly accept. 

Hearing (or the perception of hearing) can be affected by anxiety.

Do you realize how many of us have profound hearing loss and then have to look at audiograms like this?  Yours is not the only one. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thought this and never said it.

Get a grip.

your hearing is still literally perfect other than a tinnnnnny little bump at 6000 but it is still normal limits, which goes to 25 dbl anything over 25 loss is abnormal, you still have normal hearing

I saw in your last post that you had SSNHL in the past. My hearing loss slopes to severe from this, but it was profound. The hearing that came back isn’t “quite right”. What was your audiogram from that incident? 

I tend to agree that you are also experiencing a mental health issue and should seek a medical professional to help you with the intrusive/obsessive thoughts related to hearing. Not being able to hear people facing away from you in a car sounds normal….

you probably have hidden hearing loss which effects the higher frequencies.

lol. This is laughable. I wouldn’t even call this hearing loss…look at the people posting chats with 50% loss or more…that’s hearing loss…I’d kill to have hearing like this chart shows.

1ntqis7,HearingLoss,Hearing Loss After Concert - Need Advice,"Hi all, I’m very scared after developing hearing lost at a concert last week. I stupidly didn’t wear any ear protection and am now paying the consequence and have never experienced this before. 

The first night I had tinnitus and a numb, stuffed feeling in my right ear. The tinnitus persisted for 2 days and then completely resolved. I no longer have tbe tinnitus so my fear of having long term tinnitus from this can be quelled, however the inner ear muffled / stuffed feeling remains and is fluctuating. Sometimes it feels almost normal and sometimes it feels pretty intense and I am on day 5/6 after exposure. I feel like I can’t hear high frequencies as well in that ear, although it’s not as bad as it could’ve been. I am a sound engineer and am really scared that this numb / muffled feeling in my ear will last forever. I have an appointment with an ENT on Wednesday, which at that point will have been a full week since the exposure. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with the ear muffling remaining after tinnitus resolving, and then it went away at a later point? I’m trying to discern whether this is TTS or if my hearing will be permanently damaged from this to this extent that I notice it all the time. 

[댓글]
Honestly it's possible that it would be a good idea that you go to urgencies so they can give you prednisone as soon as possible. But I'm not a doctor, so I'm not sure

I had the same after a concert 5 months ago. Plugged feeling, and tinnitus. Tinnitus also went away after a day or two BUT came back 2 weeks later it seems to be permanent now. The plugged/muffled feeling lasted 3 months or so. ENTs were pretty useless in my case. My ear feels quite normal now, except for the 60 db high pitched tinnitus. Weirdly enough I developed another tone in my good ear 2 months ago.",2025-09-29 18:51:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ntqis7/hearing_loss_after_concert_need_advice/

lots of Deaf folks and hoh folks choose not to wear them at all and that is their right, i feel so sad 

[댓글]
It's understandable you are so sad after this. This is a big red flag and bad sign around control. Extend the engagement (postpone the wedding) and get some couples counseling, if possible, form a deaf or hoh man therapist. Perhaps your fiance was just frustrated or having a rough day, but this is some serious ableism and controlling behavior being revealed. Maybe you are still feeling and figuruing out your emotions after this, but the fact that you are not feeling safe to express yourself to him afterwards is also sad and scary especially if you are about to be married. Pump the brakes on the marriage plans with this one.

Is he always an asshole?

I also enjoy the silence.

this is a problem deaf and HOH people face from family, but i would NEVER marry someone who treated me like that…

i found a local deaf and hard of hearing therapist, going to try and attempt to see if we can educated him , if it continues after that, the wedding will ended not proceed,

🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

Not all hearing people are like this, sounds like he’s just an asshole. I am HoH with progressive deafness and my husband has been very patient with me. Doesn’t sound like your lack of hearing is the problem, rather it’s *his* lack of respect.

Shame is toxic, and its especially toxic to us that are already marginalized.

Its bad enough I feel like I can't function in a place where there's live music that everyone else seems to be loving, or going to a loud restaurant where my friends gab and shout and I sit there and blink and then have to go outside &amp; cry.

My partner does get annoyed when I don't put my HAs in, I can tell. But he doesn't shame me, he just says something like, ""you look lovely, would you please put your HAs in? I feel like I'm working harder than usual here.""  (The lovely part is a lie meant to buffer any shame coming from the following ask. We giggle about it.)

1nt71hm,HearingLoss,Grief about needing hearing aids at 39,"I got hearing aids a week ago and I’m having a really hard time accepting it.  First of all, I find them to be uncomfortable, due to some neurodivergent sensory sensitivities.  And then add sunglasses or glasses into the mix and it’s even worse.  I love wearing sunglasses.  I love keeping a pen behind my ear.  I also have short hair.

Aside from the physical discomfort and appearance, the way it changes my day to day is upsetting.  It feels like I can’t be carefree anymore.  And I feel like it will be another added worry in dating, which is already hard enough as it is.  The thought of having to pause while making out so I can take my hearing aids out is upsetting. 

I have to do this shit for the next 40 years?  It’s been a week and I’m tired of it already. 

Edit:  I don’t want to seem ungrateful.  I’m very privileged to have access to hearing aids and that I can hear things still.  But it’s been three weeks since finding out I need hearing aids and it’s just a lot to wrap my head around.

It will get better.  It took me months to get used to wearing hearing aids and glasses.  I also started wearing them in my early 30s and felt too young and insecure.   It’s all a big adjustment.  Also I don’t think you need to remove them when making out.  I only remove mine when swimming or showering, sleeping or exercising where I’m gonna get too hot. It does get better, just give yourself more time.

It really is a lot to wrap your head around. I’m losing my hearing in one ear pretty rapidly (and will likely be totally deaf in that ear within a year) so I’m also getting used to the idea of wearing hearing aids. I’ll probably need to wear one in my good ear as well as my deaf ear, which is frustrating. I already had trouble with auditory processing so it was difficult for me to understand people with any kind of noise in the background and now it’s so much worse.

I always kind of hate this advice, but really I think you just have to feel the feelings. Don’t let anybody tell you that this isn’t a major loss. It IS a major loss and you have every right to be sad and confused and heartbroken for as long as you need to. Trying to pretend it’s not just makes it take longer to start to feel better. 

At the same time as you’re grieving, do whatever you can to make your situation better. I’m having my first audiology appointment next week to try out some hearing aids but in the meantime have been experimenting with my AirPods Pro2, which are approved to use as hearing aids. For my needs, they’re not amazing, but it’s giving me the opportunity to see what it’s like to have artificial amplified sound. I don’t like it, it doesn’t sound natural, but the more I leave them on hearing aid mode and just leave them in my ears, the more I can tell my brain is starting to accept the sound the way it would a new pair of glasses. I’m doing this partly out of curiosity because I like experimenting with things, and partly so that it won’t be quite as emotionally difficult for me at the audiologist appointment. 

And I had a very tiny positive moment where I realized that I was hearing more in my good ear than I normally could, which was kind of fun. I could spin it for myself like being a little bit bionic. I’ve been trying to hold onto that tiny crumb of positivity while also crying and also researching hearing aids.

I'm no expert, but have you tried in the ear hearing aids? 

Even if they're not as good at amplifying, they may be 'good enough' for you situation, and avoid some of the negatives of BTE aids?

I have a love-hate relationship with my hearing aid. I can only afford the one for now, but that's ok, my left ear is 100 times worse than my right. I couldn't stand it at first. I felt like it didnt even help. Then I got some teeth pulled and have been wearing a flipper until I can afford the implants. I freaking hate that damn thing too!!!

Im 43 BTW! Part of getting older is changing old parts for new, or adding new parts i guess!!! I found the exact right setting for my hearing aid to work oretty well. I just keep the white noise going to drown out tinnitus and dont care much about it amplifying sound. Im learning to read lips because I definitely cannot hear people unless we are face to face and I can look at their mouth. I have a friend who will teach me ASL in case I need that one day. Im 30% hearing loss in both ears 😭 but the tinnitus and hypercusis in my left ear is worse than anything in the world!!! Probably nit really but it feels that way right now. 

Sorry, im rambling on when my point was: stick with the hearing aids, you get more used to them and may even start to prefer wearing them. I left mine at home today by accident and I missed it all night!  

The absolute worst is when I have forgotten that im wearing it and go to shove my ear buds in!!! OUCH!! also I wear earplugs plugs at work, and have done that with them also because I forgot to take it out first!! 

Hang in there!

Hey, I just got mine at 17, and I felt very similar to you when I first got it. Everything felt so loud, and my ear always felt itchy. But I felt like I was missing out on so much. I started to hear so many things I hadn’t heard in such a long time, and I could keep up in conversations, which made me feel more connected to others. The first month is the worst, but after that, it feels like a part of me. Sometimes I can't even tell it's on. Just know it will get better, but this hearing loss process is a journey :)

I started wearing them in my late twenties, I’m now almost 60.  The pros do outweigh the cons, though I still wish I didn’t have to wear them.  Hopefully there will be a cure for hearing loss in our lifetime, I’d love to experience hearing normally again if it did!

[deleted]

I know how you are feeling! I started wearing hearing aids in my mid to late 20s. It’s taken me 10 years to feel comfortable to start telling people at work I wear hearing aids. Is it more uncomfortable in one side than the other? My audiologist made a mold of my ear canals and right side has more of a bend than the left. It’s always more itchy when I wear hearing aids on the right bc of that bend. So I tend to wearing just one due to comfort or switch off so I can experience some “freedom” like you mentioned.   Good luck! Just think of them like glasses. You will grow to like them one day! You could also invest in a pair of AirPods!

I am 39, about to turn 40, and got my first hearing aids. Welcome to the club. 

I still have to find a trick on how to wear my hairbands, glasses and hearing aids without everything always squeezing at the back of my ears.

Could be worse, I've needed them since I was 14, but I didn't start wearing them until I was about 18.

It makes sense that the sensations of wearing hearing aids with glasses together are overwhelming and overstimulating for you. It’s not an easy change to adjust to both mentally and physically. 

It does feel awkward initially when having to pause to take your hearing aids out for sexy time. Though, it does feel more natural and less noticeable the longer you practice wearing them. I hope that the new sensations will become more comfortable for you soon. 

I needed hearing aids and glasses since I was seven-years-old so I understand how uncomfortable it can be initially. When I got to high school, I stopped wearing them because I became embarrassed. It wasn’t until I turned 30 that I picked up wearing them and had to readjust to the sensation all over again. You got this.

Can you get a digital in the ear canal type hearing aid?

I understand it's a major change but I have a few thoughts I wanted to pass along.

I honestly think that after you've had them for awhile, you will become more accustomed to them. Anyone that has switched from wearing glasses for many years to suddenly wearing contacts, (or in my case also the reverse), can understand that. 

Can you perhaps reframe the thought process in the direction of being grateful that you have hearing aids or that your hearing can be helped by hearing aids? I lost all my hearing in one ear 10+ years ago, during my forties. I was told there's nothing to be done, I just need to adjust. Which is a lovely thing to hear. 🫤

Lastly, speaking as someone who has many friends and colleagues with hearing aids over the years, including dating someone with hearing aids. Fairly certain you won't need to remove your hearing aids to make out (we never did😉). However, you might find yourself wanting a break from them,  and that's perfectly okay!

Same age and ill be getting hearing aids next week. but im also to the point of ""yeah sure, whatever. I need a name for the problem and some resolutions"" I have up on my personal image few years ago when i finally got a cpap machine and my hair line is clearly thinning. 

But its also I want to hear properly? especially my wife whose voice i love as is. the hearing aids might also help me be better at work since it seems im missing certain sounds. im nervous but excited. 

only issue I can foresee is listening to music using ear buds. I can't do that anymore. also long conference calls.",2025-09-29 02:51:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nt71hm/grief_about_needing_hearing_aids_at_39/

About 7-8 years ago had a bad experience with one of these hearing aid centers, I tried using a pair they set me up with but brought them back during trial period.  I remember they tried hitting me up real strong to keep them but refused, so that was that.
Fast forward to now. I have an appointment with one of these hearing centers for a hearing test &amp; possible hearing aids through my Medicare Advantage coverage. The test is covered but there are 2 tiers of hearing aid coverage where my out of pocket is either $600 or $1200 for a pair, which financially the $1200 is out of reach right now &amp; the $600 is a STRETCH.
I’ve been reading up on these hearing aids offered on the internet with Consumer Review with money back guarantees for $200 a pair. Was wondering if anyone has had experience with these, do they really work, &amp; if their moneyback guarantee is legit.
I’m dreading this upcoming appt &amp; I’m looking for advice if anyone can help me?Thanks!

1nsmowi,HearingLoss,realising these things make sound,"while waiting for my appt with audiology, me and my flatmate have made a list of things they can hear that i cant, that i seem to have lost over a few years since moving into the flat we live in, and im losing my mind a little bit haha  
im not sure if its a mild or moderate loss as ive heard struggling with conversations is more of a moderate thing, but im sure ill find out in my appt, i struggle more with low/mid sounds than high ones which ive also heard is a bit strange? we think it might be from either a nerve condition that im still under investigation for, or from repeated pneumonia/chest infections 

* my socks make sounds against my slippers, even when im not actively moving a lot
* soft footsteps are audible
* water can be heard even when its really thin streams of water, and when gently swooshed around in a bottle (i only hear when its higher in pitch and drops from a higher place)
* the water when people drink through a straw does makes sound, not just the clink of the straw
* light rain makes sound on the windows (i only hear really heavy rain, and ive not even heard that in ages its a soft sound for me, and we live in an area that rains a lot)
* birds still make sounds other than wings flapping loudly, i assumed the pigeons stopped cus of climate change or cus i grew up, which sounds stupid in hindsight as we have a pigeon nest right outside the kitchen window, but i can hear high pitched birds when my flatmate says its a loud/close bird!
* the planes still go by a couple times a week, i thought they stopped going so often (we live next to a very small airport)
* our upstairs neighbours are audible even when the kid isnt running around rlly loud
* you can hear other peoples breathing even when its soft
* rubbing your fingers together can be heard even when you fully extend your arm away from your ear (i stop about half way)
* clothes make soft sounds even when theyre moved, not just the rough sounds
* other people make sounds when they eat, they can probably hear me
* hair makes sound even when you are not also rubbing your scalp
* my cat is especially loud but only when i am around

Apparently i also speak pretty loud, i thought i was generally quiet unless im excited. my flatmate specifically faces towards me and speaks loud to me, they can actually whisper they just dont if theyre speaking to me (i thought they couldnt whisper)  
My alarms are very loud, and can be heard even through noise cancelling headphones from the other end of the house, if im in a deep enough sleep i dont wake up  
i really struggle to hear the door being knocked, i dont hear it unless im in the hallway, or if its loud and ive turned off all other sounds  
When people are two seats or so over from me, i cant understand what theyre saying, its very muddy, and i cant understand multiple people at once so i dont tend to socialise in groups larger than 3, and its even worse if the area we're in isnt quiet

I just thought this was all really interesting, i had no idea that i couldnt hear this stuff anymore and just wrote it all off lmao

I totally up this! Kudos to you for nailing your challenges head-on!!  
  
For some people, they immediately accept the trauma/difficulty in overcoming hearing loss, but in my case it took me almost 3-4 years right from my first audiogram test to now to finally get an hearing aid. I have mild SNHL. HA has honestly been life changing. Never gonna deny that those 4 years with life happening and dealing hearing loss was insanely difficult, but believe me, right now with the trials and hearing aids, I have gained more confidence in life and feel like I now have that edge that I always needed to function fully!!

I agree, we are quick to recognise audist/ableist practices but it is tougher to acknowledge how we may have internalised those very ideas and let them govern our lives. We often see questions around what jobs people with hearing loss can do which I think is very self-limiting.

I am wondering though, how would you describe your listening fatigue at the end of the work week/day? Even with HAs and assistive tech, I feel completely drained at the end of the day.",2025-09-27 01:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nriycc/we_can_do_it/
1nriwyi,HearingLoss,"Sudden hearing loss - my story, 16 days in","Hello. Just wanted to share my story.

I'm 36M ,healthy, fit.

36 days ago I woke up with a loud tinnitus on my right ear and a hyperacusia on my left ear. The sensitivity to sound on the left was so intense that I didnt even notice I wasnt hearing anything on my right ear.

Luckily I have an amazing wife who is also an amazing ENT. She immediately figured out it was a Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and gave me 60mg prednisone right away, at hour zero, and managed to get me an audiometry that same day.  I had a profound severe loss reaching up to 100dB in high frequencies.

I started doing everything I could, with solid evidence or not - oral corticoids, HBOT, antioxidants, vasodilators, omega 3, vitamins, intratympanic injections.

Now, 16 days in, I rdcovered some of my hearing. If I try to talk on the phone on the affecred ear, if it is a silent environment, I can do it with some effort. The tinnitus and dysacusia are painful though, loud and high pitched noises are painful. My 2yo daughter's cries are painful. When my 2 kids talk at the same time, the dog barks, I am in a loud environment, the tinnitus gets worse, I feel like burying my head somewhere. The corticosteroids are not helping either, I am having insomnia and am in a constant state of stress.

The pictures are my audiometries on day zero and day 16.

That’s a huge loss! I’m so sorry.

I'm sorry. Its such a bloody shock when it happens.

You have improved with your audiogram, and hopefully will improve further. If not - you should at least be a candidate for a good quality hearing aid. So life will go on and you will adjust.

For me - I left work to deal with it all. I spend time out in nature and re-adjusting to my new life. The tinnitus is the worst part for me, but I'm hoping to habituate. I do think my reactive tinnitus is slightly improving over time.

You're in good company here. Keep posting.

stay on the steroids.  do a month long taper if need be.  it's possible more hearing will return.  keep an ear plug in all day if you can stand it.

Honestly, my best week of improvement was after the second week. I hardly noticed improvement the first two. I hope you also continue to get better!

I also underwent an MRI which didnt show anything on the affected side but found a possible 0.2cm neurinoma on the unaffected side. 😵‍💫

How are you feeling now? I’m in a similar boat! Profound Left SSNHL, day 14 now.

Hello.
Updates: i am almost 2 months in now.
I had been doing audiometries weekly and my hearing was improving. I then paused the audiometries for 3 weeks, wgile still doing the IT injections.

last week i did one more audiometry after 3 weeks. Hearing didnt improve.

My symptoms: whar bothers me is not the loss itself but the hearing dysfunction that comes along: the tinnitus, which didnt improve at all, the difficulty whm I am in a loud envuronment withcmany people speaking simultanously,  and the pain I feel with high pitched loud noises. I dont know how to describe it, when Ixam exposed to loud high pitched noises.the tinnitus increases, I get atressed, I feel like I am being acutely harmed. I have a 5yo and a 2yo and I love playing rough and loud with them so this has been really hard for me.to cope with. Somehow the last audiometry helped me feel more at ease ans reminded me that it iscall in my brain.

I started using a hearing aid a few days ago. I felt hopeful it would give my brain the inout it needed to ease the tinnitus but it didnt. Idont feel much different.

I have not tried hearing aids, however my first ENT says that I do qualify for them. Seeking a second opinion, I went to see another ENT doctor Otologist. This one recommends surgery as he believes that I have Otosclerosis (but CT imaging doesn't confirm this) and he wants to perform surgery.

My surgery orders are the following: Stapedectomy w/ drill out, fat graft from ear lobe.

He described the surgery as cutting behind the ear and it not being a high-risk surgery to my existing hearing. I've read that other patients that get the Stapedectomy have it done through the ear, is my surgeon's method common as well?

I just wanted to get some other opinions on the Stapedectomy as a first-line treatment. I still am considering hearing aids so I scheduled the surgery four months out, to give me enough time to get fitted for hearing aids (Rx) and give them a fair shake. I am concerned however that the hearing aids would potentially amplify the loud static I described earlier. I also experience a constant hum in the affected ear and it gets worse when it's quiet.

1nptebl,HearingLoss,"68% word recognition, Phonak Aides &amp; Feedback","Bilateral hearing loss with Word recognition scores judged to be good (88%) in the right ear, and fair (68%) in the left ear due to advanced otosclerosis. I wear Phonak Nadia aids with fitted molds but hearing overall is still a challenge, especially on my left side. I have started to need to rely on text to speech and closed captions for many aspects of work. I have been followed by audiologist since 7th grade (currently 40s) so none of this is new to me but as the loss in my ears progresses aids are causing pretty significant feedback including others being able to hear themselves through my aides because I need to turn volume up on the aides and I still hear poorly. I have a great audiologist but want to go prepared with questions/ideas. Do we get more serious about the CI discussion even though I'm probably not a candidate yet (would most likely try stapedectomy first but due to advanced otosclerosis large likelihood it won't be successful)? Could it be poorly fitted aides? Or are there better models to consider? Do I just deal with the feedback bc that's just where my hearing is at? Trying at asses what's ""normal"" and best options.

TLDR: 68% word recognition with Phonak aids causing feedback. Best options to explore?

Edit to add: Aides are Phonak Nadia P70-UP

[댓글]
I had increasing feedback with my prior model of Phonak CICs. We were pretty much pushing the limits of the receiver. Once we switched to newer ones with a stronger receiver, the feedback stopped.

It could be a variety of things. How long have you had the Naidas for? Which Naida are they (Marvel, Paradise, Lumity)? Has there been any changes to your hearing within that time?

It could be your HAs need some fine tuning if they are relatively new or your hearing has changed over time.

Have you tried any of the wireless Phonak microphones that link to the HAs? They can help with speech clarity.

If you've had the HAs for a while, it could be your brain is so used to the HAs, you experience this as your HAs not helping much anymore.

Also, if I am to rely solely on my HAs, my speech comprehension would be pretty poor. When I went an appointment with an ENT consultant, he told me he could clearly see how much I rely on lip reading. So, I could seemingly be having a good conversation with someone but if they suddenly turn their head, I immediately lose any comprehension despite still hearing their voice. Hearing aids do just that, they aid hearing but to maximise speech comprehension, you need to work out which strategies work for you. For example, it's relatively quiet day in the office so I could manage a conversation with someone but if it is noisy, lots of people are in and talking to other people, then I will ask whoever wants to speak to me (or I want to speak to) to go to a quieter area. Or, if it's group banter, I will likely just ""zone out"" - my brain will thank me for the rest anyway!

That said, you could be a candidate for CI. Naida HAs are for severe-profound hearing losses so you may meet the criteria. In any case, you do need to speak to your audiologist. Key is to ask questions to explore as many possibilities as possible whether HAs or CI.

Your word recognition should be based on hearing tests, not bringing the HA into play. No HA is going to change that unless it makes it worse because of improper fitting. As far as feedback, a stronger receiver and/or custom mold should help with that. I would suggest you seek out an ENT and consider a CI with your word recognition, just to get info on them. I don't think you'd be a candidate yet, though, as I think your word recognition has to be below 60. At least that was the criteria about a year ago. Not sure what it is today.",2025-09-25 01:01:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nptebl/68_word_recognition_phonak_aides_feedback/

Yup- I had it bad for a few months post SSHL in February. It went away… I credit the low dose serotonin (zoloft) I started to take as helping with that. Helped my T too. Note - i had to ramp up the dosage very slowly because I found too fast made it worse. 

I also didn’t avoid sound and told myself it was ok/safe to hear noise… it was awful. Physical pain when my husband would just crack his knuckles or putting dishes away. All better now. Best of luck.

Mine has gotten much better over time. I think it took about 10 months to see improvement.

J'ai de l'hyperacousie depuis 7 ans, et au début, je portais une protection auditive 24h/24 et 7j/7. Aujourd'hui, ce qui me dérange le plus, ce sont les bruits soudains et forts. Je pense aussi que j'ai de la phonophobie (peur des sons) et la peur d'aggraver ma santé auditive. J'essaie de travailler dessus, mais c'est dur.

J'ai fait ça pendant 3 ans, par peur d'aggraver mon audition à cause de ma voiture, des toilettes, de la vaisselle ou des claquements de portes.

Puis un jour, j'ai rencontré quelqu'un qui avait de l'hyperacousie, et je lui ai demandé :  tu ne portes pas de protection auditive, même à la maison ?""

Elle a répondu : ""Non, il ne faut surtout pas se surprotéger !""

Aucun médecin ne m'avait dit ça, et j'ai progressivement arrêté de porter ma protection auditive dans ma vie quotidienne, et petit à petit, mon hyperacousie s'est améliorée.

Je peux conduire sans protection auditive, par exemple (volume enregistré à 85 dB en moyenne dans ma voiture), je peux marcher dans une rue avec des voitures (70-75 dB), mais dès qu'il y a de la foule, de la musique, des travaux, etc., je ne peux pas l'entendre. Je porte mes protections auditives -25dB.

Si je dois faire un long trajet sur l'autoroute en voiture, je porte mes protections auditives -15dB.

Je vous encourage à faire de même. Habituez doucement vos oreilles au bruit au début, mais ne portez pas vos protections auditives 24h/24 et 7j/7, vous allez vous faire du mal. (Sauf si vous avez une hyperacousie douloureuse.)

1np9rst,HearingLoss,Tinnitus started after ear drops - 3 weeks ago,"I've been experiencing persistent tinnitus in my left ear for about 3 weeks now, and I'm 100% certain it started immediately after using Aleavia ear drops (sodium bicarbonate solution for wax removal).

Timeline:
- Used Aleavia drops because I felt my ear was blocked with wax
- Tinnitus appeared right after using the drops
- Got ear irrigation at doctor's office a few days later
- Waited about a week thinking it might be from the irrigation procedure
- Tinnitus never went away, went back to doctor

Current symptoms:
- Constant tinnitus in left ear (very bothersome, never stops)
- Clicking/popping sounds when bending down (like during prayer/bowing) or changing head position
- Clicking in left ear when opening mouth wide or yawning
- I also have TMJ issues (jaw problems) on the left side

Medical evaluation:
- Doctor examined ear, said it's clean with no visible issues
- Had hearing tests done (tympanometry, pure tone audiogram, etc.)
- Doctor prescribed: Prednisolone 30mg (tapering every 5 days), Epicopred 20mg, and a supplement
- When I asked if the ear drops could have caused this, doctor said no

What I think (I might be wrong):
Given my TMJ and eustachian tube issues, I suspect the ear drops penetrated deeper than they should have, possibly reaching the middle/inner ear and causing inflammation that the doctor can't visually detect.

Questions:
- Has anyone experienced tinnitus after using ear wax removal drops?
- Should I take the prescribed corticosteroids? (Never used steroids before)
- Could the drops have caused microscopic inflammation that's not visible during examination?
- Is 3 weeks still considered ""acute"" tinnitus with good chances of recovery?

I'm terrified this might be permanent. The constant ringing is exhausting and driving me to my breaking point.",2025-09-24 11:37:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1np9rst/tinnitus_started_after_ear_drops_3_weeks_ago/

I'm wondering if the ear plugs may have caused the hearing loss? My ears are often sore in the morning from removing them because of the suction they create. Could this suction pain have been responsible for my hearing loss?

I’m 21 and i don’t know what to do or how to feel. I currently wear a hearing aid but all I hear is static noises. It works in 1 on 1 conversations but in loud environments it feels like the static just overtakes my good ear and makes it harder for me to hear. I’ve been struggling to cope as I can’t find anyone around the same age as me that this happened to. It sucks because i feel alone in this journey and it’s making me depressed knowing all i’m going to hear is tinnitus in my left ear or static. I’m currently not a cochlear candidate because I still have very good residual hearing from what my audiologist had said but the 36% WRS is where it gets tricky. Will this ever get any better? I know a cure is very unlikely due to the complexity of the cochlea and i’m pretty sure i’ll eventually need a cochlear implant in the future.

I am in the exact same situation as you I am 20 years old and have severe to profound bilateral hearing loss I have 2 hearing aids and the same thing only really hear static noise I can make out about 30 percent of what someone is saying in a quiet environment I am on the waiting list to get cochlear implants it’s very very tough I’ve been in this situation for almost 2 years with no known cause I want you to know your not alone no matter how much you feel that you are we the deaf community need to support each other and stand up for change in everyday life I myself sometimes forget that I am the way that I am and can’t watch movies or shows with subtitles and haven’t been able to listen to music in 2 years these simple things that people take for granted we would give anything to be able to do again

You could ask for a second opinion; they might authorize you for a cochlear implant. I’ve heard of people with up to 60% hearing loss who get approved for it. As for hearing like before, I don’t think so: the cochlear implant brings sharpness, volume, and clarity, but only after a lot of practice. It’s a long journey to learn how to listen again.  
I have hidden hearing loss since April 2026. It’s hard to say how I feel; I sense that my right ear only hears about half of what it used to, and it feels strange. I still have trouble sleeping because of the tinnitus, but well, I keep thinking about what I might do in the future.

Same situation as you, lost my hearing in one ear 4 months ago and it's also reverse slope. 
My experience with the hearing aid has been very disappointing, as you said, it helps in a quiet room, but in loud environments like a restaurant I dont hear much what people are saying. Which one are you using ? I have widex allure 440.

they should be able to specifically alter each frequency to fit your chart, but this type is one of the hardest to treat! i also have it very similar to yours, my lower levels are normal but going as well as i have degenerative loss, i have the option intent ones and they are incredible but pricy, it still isn’t perfect but makes the world of a difference. as far as noise and volume goes they can turn that down some of it’s too much, lots of trial and error

I'm trying out the Oticon now and I had the same problem as far as being either not loud enough to hear speech or too loud in noisy environment. Also, when he raised the mid tones, which is apparently speech, it was ice pick sharpness, which I couldn't tolerate. Finally, this last time he raised the low frequencies and high frequencies and lowered the mid range tones and that is so much better. I can't tell you where my hearing loss is greater, though, so your situation could be entirely different. Your audiologist needs to playplay around with that. It's annoying and time consuming but keep at it. I also tried the Resound HA, which was much better than the Oticon before these last setting changes so if you can't get the settings correct with the Oticon, try a different HA.

1noqd24,HearingLoss,"Help me, weird change in my tinnitus","Hi everyone, I’m a 28-year-old woman. Sorry for my English, it’s not my first language.
I’ve been dealing with tinnitus since November 2024, after a night out at a club. My hearing felt muffled and I noticed the ringing, so I went to the ER a couple of days later. They told me it was an acoustic trauma. Luckily, all the tests I did afterwards showed no hearing damage. After a month of steroids, meds, and supplements, I tried to stay strong and get used to the noise. My tinnitus is quite low — I only notice it in silence. After the first six months of anxiety, panic, and depression, I slowly went back to a more or less normal life, although I still struggle with a lot of anxiety about it.

I’m writing here because since about a week ago I’ve been experiencing something strange in my right ear. My baseline tinnitus seems slightly louder (though I’m not even sure about that). What worries me most is that sometimes, when I talk, my tinnitus seems to “react” to the sound of my own voice. More specifically, when I speak, I hear a kind of higher-pitched tinnitus in my right ear, and I can even notice it in noisy environments. It doesn’t last long, but it’s happening more and more often these last few days and, even though I’m trying to stay calm, the truth is that I’m terrified.

I also feel a sensation of pressure in my right ear, almost like it’s “wet,” but I can’t tell if it’s real or just in my head.

Has anything like this ever happened to you? Please, if you can, answer me — I really, really need some comfort right now.

It sounds like reverb. I get it all the time. Think something’s pinging off a taunt drum in this case  your ear drum. Maybe something’s on it. Get it checked out!

Hi.. I also faced something similar to your situation. Seven days ago. I visited ENT specialist regarding continuous ringing sound in my left ear. He ran some test, basically, the hearing test or audiometry test in those he found that I was suffering from mild SNHL so he prescribed me some steroids and some other medicines and told me to come for follow-up after five days, I did not feel any change in the ringing sound in my left ear so I visited today and told him that He told me to get audiometry test done again, and guess what today my hearing levels in both of the ear found in normal range but that ringing sound in my left ear is still there when I told him that he told me it’s all in your head. Try to relax and listen to some light music like raining and nature sound. It will help you distract yourself from the ringing sound. He also assured me that there is no need to panic. Ringing sound will disappear eventually, and here i found you suffering from tinnitus from approximately a year will it get better? Or disappear completely is there any chance?

1nodygu,HearingLoss,(caution graphic content) is my right ear drum damaged?,"I woke up three days ago with a clogged right ear. The day before, it felt fine. I suspected it was just swollen like it had been before and that it would simply go away on its own.

Later, I tried cleaning my ear to see what was going on. I removed a surprising amount of earwax from my right ear and did my best not to push any of it further in. However, there is a part I cannot reach, and I am too scared to try for fear of worsening the situation.

I am wondering if the grayish-white substance I see is my eardrum. I plan to go to an ENT doctor in a few days to get it checked. I can still hear, but my hearing is muffled.",2025-09-23 10:41:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nodygu/caution_graphic_content_is_my_right_ear_drum/

My Hearing Journey

18 years ago I lost the hearing in my left ear.  It pretty much happened overnight.  I woke up one morning and could barely hear out of one ear.  I had a doctor check for a blockage, but they didn’t see anything out of the ordinary and suggested I see an otorhinolaryngologist. That’s a fancy word for an ear, nose and throat doctor. 

The ENT doctor originally thought I had Meniere’s Disease.  This is a condition that prevents fluids from draining properly from the body and can lead to hearing loss.   The prescription was for steroids and a diuretic to remove the excess fluids and hope to restore the hearing loss.  He also suggested I get a brain MRI just to be sure it wasn’t anything more serious, although they doubted the MRI would reveal anything. 

The steroids worked for a short time and restored a small bit of the hearing, but not enough to make a serious difference.  So I went for the MRI and was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma in my left ear.  According to Google, “An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a non-cancerous tumor that grows on the nerve responsible for balance and hearing. It typically affects middle-aged individuals and can cause symptoms like hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), and balance problems. Treatment options include observation, surgery, or radiation.”

Well, that sucked. 

I wasn’t middle-aged, I was 35, and developing an acoustic neuroma is extremely rare for someone of that age.  Lucky me.  So I couldn’t hear out of my left ear, and I have a brain tumor.  It wasn’t even one of those cool tumors that gives superpowers allowing me to join the X-Men or Avengers.  Just a shitty little tumor that ate the hearing in my ear. 

If you haven’t experienced hearing loss, you cannot know what it is like.   I misunderstand or completely lose most conversations coming from my left side.  I have no directional hearing, meaning I cannot tell where noises or sounds are coming from.  I must always walk with people to my right, and I need to sit down at restaurants before everyone else to ensure I’ll get a proper seat in which to hear as many people as possible.  When I’m alone, I need to have the TV volume cranked high, or turn on close captioning.  If there’s loud ambient environmental noise, I can’t even hear the people talking to me at my own table.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been sitting at a table with four people feeling absolutely alone. 

Most people who know me understand and try to accommodate me.  That doesn’t make it any less depressing. 

There’s a stigma attached to people with hearing loss.  When someone constantly has to say “What?” or “Can you repeat that?” you automatically think that there is something wrong with them.  In your mind, they are slow or stupid.  I’m neither of those things, but often times I feel that way.

Short-term summary was complete hearing loss in my left ear.  The “good” news was that I wasn’t suffering from vertigo or tinnitus.  Also, the growth was located near the bones in my inner ear, which meant that it wouldn’t grow as quickly as if it were located in a different spot in my head.  Possible treatments included drilling into my brain to remove the tumor or laser radiation to kill it.  Neither of these would restore my hearing, but both have potential disastrous side effects.  I’ll pass, thanks.  Doctors said to get regular MRI’s every few years to track the growth rate and make sure it doesn’t grow into a dangerous location or size. 

When I got my original diagnosis, I started visiting the House Ear Clinic with doctors who specialize in that kind of medicine.  They informed me that the hearing would be lost in that ear with no chance of restoring it.  The nerve was dead and the ability to hear from that ear died with it.  A traditional hearing aid would not work because they are for people with diminished hearing, not total unilateral hearing loss.  There’s a hearing solution called a CROS, which is essentially a speaker that takes sound from the bad ear and moves it to the good ear.  This would allow me to acquire sounds from my bad side but wouldn’t do anything about directional hearing or ambient noise issues.  I have never tried any hearing aids, but I have periodically looked into new technologies and solutions in case something better ever came along. 

Fast forward to this earlier this year.  During an annual physical, my doctor prescribed another MRI as it had been a few years since the last one.  I scheduled my MRI with the laboratory where I had received my first one 18 years ago.  They are very large company and have numerous offices and I’m not disclosing their name for reasons you will understand shortly.

When I went for the appointment, I was still in their system from my first visit and they offered to provide a DVD with slides from both the first and most current MRI’s for comparisons sake.  Perfect.  I told them I had an acoustic neuroma in the left ear, and that was what we there to scan and analyze.

MRI went fine, I got my DVD and the plan was to have their radiologist look at the slides and send them to my physician.  A few days later, I received a note from my doctor via the online portal.  The message says simply, “Normal MRI.”  That ain’t right.  Unless the tumor fairy came and removed the one from my ear, I’m pretty sure it’s still in there.  I asked the doctor to have the lab recheck the slide.  Her response was,” Interestingly they did not even see the acoustic neuroma.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  I will try to reach out to radiologist to look at images again.”

Fine, maybe they missed it the first time.  They can have a mulligan.  Next message stated that upon rechecking that no acoustic neuroma was found in the right ear.  While that is technically true, the neuroma is in my left f\*\*\*ng ear!  These guys are 0 for 2 and quickly losing any confidence I may have had.  I sent another message to the doctor asking them to check a THIRD time. 

The doctor sent me this message a day later.  “Radiologist reviewed imaging from 2006 and said you never had anything in the right ear.”  I kid you not, they checked the wrong ear AGAIN.  I exploded at my doctor and asked her to call me right away as this has turned into a comically awful SNL skit.  Mrs. Doctor actually called me on the phone and said, “Sorry, I meant to say left ear and not right ear.  But they have concluded that you never had a neuroma in the left ear and there’s something in the central region of my brain that may be the issue.” 

Yeah, no.  That’s wrong for so many reasons.  Here’s my message to the doctor, “Forgive me, but I no longer have any confidence in anyone who's looked at my case recently. The Radiologists have been terrible. I originally got the diagnosis from the House Ear Institute and I'm going to be working with them going forward.”  I haven’t been back to my primary physician since, not sure if I’ll be returning.   

Thankfully, the House Ear Institute and Clinic is awesome. They have a FREE service for patients suffering with neuromas.  You can send in your MRI results and they will have a doctor look at them and contact you with the results.  Done. 

I received a call a week later from the House Clinic.  The doctor wanted to speak with me about some potential treatment options that I may not be aware of.  I met with the doctor over Zoom and he had compared the MRI results from 18 years ago and from this year.  The tumor has grown slowly but is not really big enough to have to worry about it just yet.  HOWEVER…. There’s a new procedure that they’ve started performing in the last few years for people in my exact situation.  Because of where the tumor is located in the inner ear canal, it’s now possible to remove the tumor and install a cochlear implant at the same time.  If I have the procedure and all goes well, I could recover up to 80% of the hearing in my bad ear.  Wait, what? 

I told him I was informed years ago that I would never hear again in that ear.  Old news I guess.  We asked what has changed recently to make this procedure viable and he replied that the technology has progressed to the point where processors are so fast that they can send signals to the brain from both the good and bad ear so that your grey matter can hear and process both inputs at the same time.

So…I can have my tumor removed AND get hearing back?  Yes, please.  Where do I sign up?

Important Note:  I am NOT a doctor.  If you are reading this and have an acoustic neuroma, or know someone that does, it does not necessarily mean that this procedure will work for you/them.  My acoustic neuroma is technically called an intracochlear schwannoma.   It differs from 99% of other neuromas based on where it is located in my ear.  I would advise you to ask your ENT about your situation and if anything has changed with medicine that may benefit you personally. 

Back to my story.  The doctor recommended I schedule an in-person visit and a have an audiology and balance test on both ears.  The results of these would determine the next possible steps.

A few weeks later, I went to the House Institute for my first round of tests.  The audiology test is pretty standard – sit in a padded booth for about 20-30 minutes while they pipe noise into your good and bad ears.  The results were as expected, zero hearing in the bad ear, close to perfect in the good. 

The balance test (VNG) was next up.  This was an odd set of tests that I really don’t recommend as a fun way to spend an afternoon.  It started with donning a pair of goggles, similar to wearing a VR headset.  The next 30 minutes were spent watching green dots and lines jump around a TV, while the goggles recorded the movement of my eyeballs.  I was told to lie down, then quickly stand up and perform other head/body movements.  Nothing had made me dizzy or nauseous so far.  The technician then told me they were going to spray cold water then warm water in my left ear then right ear to gauge my reaction.  First up was my left (bad) ear.  I really can’t explain the sensation of cold water being squirted into your ear for 30 seconds straight.  But it’s not pleasant.  However, no dizziness, no nausea.  I asked if I was “supposed” to be feeling anything.  I wanted to be sure to give whatever answers were going to get insurance to cover my procedure.  I’m not suggesting I was willing to lie, but I was willing “fudge” my dizziness level if that what was required.

Not to worry, 30 seconds of cold water in my good ear took care of the dizziness problem.  The room started spinning like I was a drunken freshman again.  It only lasted for a few minutes and fortunately my cheeseburger lunch stayed in my stomach.  I asked if this was good, bad or normal news?  She said the tests most likely showed that I have zero balance left in the bad ear, but normal balance in my good.  This was actually good news as I would be less likely to suffer vertigo after potential surgery.  Yay!  By the way, the warm water was no less awful than the cold.

After the tests, I met with my doctor from the House Institute.  He reviewed the results and reiterated that I was a good candidate for the surgery that would remove the acoustic neuroma while they inserted a cochlear implant.  The balance test showed that I would likely not have balance or vertigo issues, but obviously nothing is certain.  They also mentioned that during the surgery, they would be plugging my ear to protect it from foreign objects.  The damn thing doesn’t work anyways, plug away.

The following month, I went back for a second round of hearing tests.  The audiologist confirmed that these tests were necessary to get insurance approval for the procedure and implant.  Insurance doesn’t often don’t cover single-sided deafness, so additional testing was necessary for approval.  For this next session, the doctor told me they were fitting me for hearing aid in my bad ear for the upcoming test. 

I sat there stunned for about 5 minutes.  Was I actually going to be able to hear something again?  Anything?  I had never tried any kind of hearing aid so this would potentially be the first hearing of any kind in nearly 20 years from my bad ear.  I asked the doctor how exactly the hearing aid was going to work considering my neuroma.  His response was “It won’t work, we just have to test anyways for insurance purposes.”  Way to burst my bubble, doc.   I spent the next 30 minutes in a sound-proof room shaking my head no as they continually piped noise into my bad and ear and I continued not to hear any of it. 

The good news was that the doctor was now convinced I was an ideal candidate for the cochlear implant surgery and that he was certain insurance would cover it.  So certain that we spent the next 30 minutes going over the various implants and which options I wanted.  We ordered my hearing aid and I got to pick out cool colors and accessories.  (I declined the add-on that would let me take my implant deep sea diving). 

Two weeks later, I got the call that insurance was covering everything except my out-of-pocket deductible.  I’m not going into specifics, but the procedure and implant normally run about $100,000.  I’m paying significantly less than that. 

The surgery is out-patient and normally takes 2-3 hours.  Unless I suffer from severe vertigo after the surgery, I’ll be able to go home and enjoy the free narcotics they’ll be giving me. 

By the way, I have decided to break this narrative into separate parts.  When I’m healed and ready to write again, I’m going to start working on part two of this journey.  For those of you who don’t know about the implant procedure, they wait about 3-4 weeks for your head to completely heal then turn on the device for the first time.  If all goes well, I’ll be hearing something again in month.  I’ll be sure to keep you all updated.

The procedure is scheduled for September 23^(rd).  That’s tomorrow.

 

Wish me luck.

Is this something I should go to the ER bay for instead? Or anywhere else?

Yes go to the ER.

You need to get on steroids ASAP.

Every time I go to my ENT, he tells me how he wishes I had gotten to him sooner. It was three weeks. If I had it to do again and couldn’t find an available ENT, I’d go to the emergency room.

I had otitis media when I was 14 and the audiologist told me I had lost 30% of my hearing. Years later I had another audiometry test that revealed normal hearing. In your case, it could come back or it could be mucus causing temporary hearing loss.

This sounds familiar. I DID get to the doctor and got nothing to treat it. I’ve now lost almost all the treble in my right ear. Mad ringing. Had an MRI and was basically told “too bad.” I can’t listen to music anymore as sound “hurts” and my own daughter’s voice causes me pain. This was all 6 months ago. It hasn’t gotten any better.

Get to a doctor ASAP, even if you have to go to the ER. The longer you wait to get steroids, the less likely they are to work and the more likely your hearing loss ends up being permanent.

I'm sorry this is happening. I can relate to the vertigo but not the tinnitus. At least you got the prednisone. It's insane trying to get appointments for anything anymore. How did it get so bad?

I see this post was made 4 days ago — did the prednisone help? Did you end up going back for the ER?

This caught my attention as something similar happened to me 6 years ago. After a severe ear infection I suddenly lost all hearing on that side, all frequencies, for sounds inside and outside my body, which was a surreal and scary experience. I went to the ER for treatment too. Happy ending to my story: My hearing recovered back to normal (mild hearing loss only) over the course of a week.

1no04j2,HearingLoss,Marching band drumline may have killed my ears,"I've been in several bands for almost a decade; I've played just about every low brass instrument. To this point, I've never had any hearing problems. The other day, my college band was directed to perform a small pep rally in a very small building - and I get put directly next to the drumline + cymbals (which regularly wear earplugs for themselves during performances). I didn't know I was placed there until it was too late, so I didn't end up getting any kind of ear protection. Pep rally lasted probably less than 5 minutes, but during that time, hearing got really bad, felt like I was underwater, all that stuff. 4 days later and I'm still noticing discomfort. Folks, am I screwed?

The marching band drums definitely had impact on my hearing. However, mine was repeated many times.

How lasting your damage is depends on: 

* your body's predisposition for hearing loss (some people are more susceptible than others) 
* the duration and volume of the noise - 5 minutes is not long, although the volume is a lot.

You likely did not take much of a permanent hit from this one incident. It's the accumulated duration and volume of all the incidents you need to look out for.

They have ideas you can use.

You might consider making sure HR and your manager know about your hearing loss. Your employer must provide you reasonable accommodation. Being able to work remotely and use video-conferencing with CC is a form of accommodation.

Tap into resources from vocational rehab.  Send a written note to HR that says you have a hearing disability and will be requesting reasonable accommodation. If you are in USA become familiar with the ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act. You can reach out to the ADA hotline to get ideas of how to approach your needs.  I use closed captioning software on my phone and a microphone that sends sound to my hearing aid .  


It took a long time to get my hearing management to understand the impact of noise on some Deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Imagine explaining to a hearing person that deaf people are more sensitive to noise than hearing people.  Unless you are living it, it sounds silly.  What worked for me was to describe how my brain is working overtime to process sound since my sudden hearing loss. I describe my brain as if it is an extra person.  I had sudden hearing loss and only have partial hearing in 1 ear. My brain is incapable of simultaneously processing sound from two different sources. I used sentences like ""this makes my brain angry"" Or  ""when my brain is over worked in this way, it makes me pay"".  Make sure you are truthful and not over exaggerating. Just help them understand your reality.


If you are in the USA your employer should have a form to formally apply for accommodation.  Take the form along with your job description and a list of essential functions to your audiologist or ENT and get a medical note describing your limitations.and where you need accommodation.  When you've established that foundation you can begin the interactive process of identifying your accommodation needs and exploring solutions.  The process will educate everyone involved.  It is your friend and your power.  Remember that the interactive process is ongoing.  You may need to try things out and make modifications as things change. Give and ask for some grace while you learn and explore together.  Good luck!",2025-09-22 20:06:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nnx209/back_to_officeaccommodations/

Highly highly likely to be temporary. You've got something happening in your left middle ear, probably due to the cold, which can take some time to clear up. Keep taking the medication you have been prescribed.

left ear SCREAMS conductive loss to me which would be from a cold. type B tymp means ear drum/middle ear, not your cochlea. your bone conduction levels on the left are also normal

What med were you prescribed?

Last year I had a cold and had an audiogram done, and I had almost -60dB in the 6000Hz range and -35dB in the 8000Hz range in my right ear. I was scared by the results; I couldn't believe it.

I also WFH and have been struggling a lot to focus.

Are there any doctors, clinics, or trials in Europe (or elsewhere) exploring alternative medicine or experimental treatments that could help?

[댓글]
Let me start by saying that I totally do not recommend this. While I was exposed to an extremely loud sound an ENT prescribed, well not exactly prescribed, just said I should go to the drugstore and get some niacin. After taking niacin for a few days, my hearing got a little bit better, but I suspect it would have gotten better anyway. And niacin is extremely uncomfortable and no longer recommending for anything as far as I know. This happened circa 1975.

May you please share your audiogram?

Have you had oral steroid and intratympanic steroid treatments? MRI?  What is your word recognition score in the left ear?

It sucks because your loss in the speech ranges. And the tinnitus is usually roaring or loud humming which is hard to 'ignore.' (one of my tones is similar).

I'm sorry this has happened to you. I have no advice of alternative treatments. But, have faith that the brain will continue to adjust in time. You're still very early 4 months in. From what I've read the vast majority of people improve in time in terms of how they accept and manage the condition. If it's possible - take some time off work.

1nlo4uj,HearingLoss,Absent OAE but Normal Audiogram + One Abnormal ABR — Anyone Else Experienced This?,"Hi everyone,  
I’d like to share my case to see if anyone here has had something similar or any insights.

* **OAE (otoacoustic emissions):** several times tested, always absent.
* **PEAT / ABR:** only done once (in 2021), came out abnormal on the left ear (prolonged latencies, low amplitudes).
* **Everyday experience:** in quiet or 1:1 conversations I understand perfectly. But in noisy environments (store, bar, group talk) I can hear the sounds but my brain just “goes blank” — I don’t distinguish words. Volume doesn’t help.
* **Rehabilitation:** I did auditory training (central auditory processing rehab) back in 2021, and it helped a lot. A reevaluation in 2025 showed no clear CAPD, only fragile attention in noise.
* **ENTs told me:** “audiometry is what matters, OAE absence can happen with minimal damage.” But this doesn’t explain the ABR result and my real-world difficulties.

**My questions:**

1. Has anyone here had absent OAE + normal audiometry? Did it cause problems in noise?
2. Could this fit into “Hidden Hearing Loss / cochlear synaptopathy”?
3. Should I repeat the ABR to see if the abnormal result persists?
4. Any tips for managing daily life with this weird “I hear but I don’t understand” situation?

Thanks for reading — I feel really frustrated sometimes, but I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations.

this is such an interesting case, try r/askaudiology in my opinion!! best of luck :)

also, OAE can have a false absent due to the probe, but an ABR being wrong seems much less likely to me",2025-09-20 03:53:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nlo4uj/absent_oae_but_normal_audiogram_one_abnormal_abr/

1nl31mq,HearingLoss,Found out after 6 months of waiting: my hearing is much worse than I realized,"Hi everyone,
I’m a nursing student in Denmark (originally from a Slavic country ), and today I’m still in shock after finally seeing a hearing specialist.

On my 3rd semester I had a practice placement with a school nurse who was checking 3rd graders’ hearing. Out of curiosity, I asked her to check mine. After the test, she looked at me with a death stare and told me I had serious hearing issues. She even showed me my audiogram, which was a complete surprise to me.

After that I booked a specialist appointment, but since healthcare in Denmark is free, I had to wait 6 months for today’s visit.

The results:
	•	Asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss
	•	Speech discrimination score: 20% on one side, 10% on the other
	•	Speech comprehension threshold (TC): around 33/30 dB
	•	Large high-frequency loss in both ears
	•	Retracted eardrum on the right side

The doctor said it’s either genetic or related to frequent ear infections I had as a child. There isn’t really a medical fix, only hearing aids.

I always thought I was just not concentrating enough, or maybe even “stupid,” because I’ve been struggling with learning Danish. In my mother language , my brain can fill in missing parts of sentences, but in Danish it doesn’t work that way — and now I understand it’s not me, it’s my hearing.

I often feel exhausted after conversations, and in noisy environments I can barely understand what’s being said. It’s affecting my studies and social life a lot.

Has anyone here had similar results (very low speech discrimination scores + high-frequency loss)? Did hearing aids make a big difference for you, especially with learning or understanding a second language?
Any advice or shared experiences would mean so much 

[댓글]
In the UK I’ve not had a speech discrimination test before and I have high frequency hearing loss. I know exactly what you mean about filling in sentences, I think we must be experts at guessing what’s being said based on context and everything we know about grammar and vocabulary. All the guessing is certainly tiring. Sadly I only know one language but even with the vastly different dialects and vocabulary across the UK it’s a similar affect

its not too bad so dont panic! not an AuD but the left will likely be easier to use a hearing aid with. its really hard to correct some frequencies without hurting residual hearing (aka natural low frequency hearing could be reduced when using a hearing aid). you have more frequencies missing on the left though so benefits would likely outweigh the cons. on the right i wouldnt say the same. you have mostly normal hearing minus 2 frequencies so a hearing aid may do more harm than good. the right is also likely at least partially conductive from the retracted ear drum and may resolve

even at best, hearing aids are not a miracle fix. for many they are great!!! i just like to encourage realistic expectations because many end up disappointed. 

like i said, not an AuD, just someone with weird cookie bite loss and that is what i have learned. best of luck!!!

Ah this must be a shock OP. However, in some ways at least you know now why you've been struggling.

Overall,  it's not 'too bad.' You still have moderate hearing in both ears, generally. I'd definitely try hearing aids. There's a good chance they will help you significantly, though it may take some tinkering to find the right ones and to get the settling correct.",2025-09-19 13:05:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nl31mq/found_out_after_6_months_of_waiting_my_hearing_is/
1nl1d7q,HearingLoss,The Day My Mom Finally Heard My Whisper Again,"I had never thought that I would witness my own mother softly slip into a world where silence screamed more loudly than sound. To become deaf is not merely to miss words it is to lose pieces of life that you are unable to mend.

Little things at first. She'd laugh two seconds later in church because she'd only heard the joke when someone else had prodded her. She'd leave the TV blaring so loudly the neighbors would bang on the wall. But then it got ugly.

I'd go home and she'd not hear the kettle boiling. I'd shout her name from another room and get nothing, believing that she was dead or something. Other times she'd sit at our family meals, smiling and her head nodding, but I could notice in her eyes: she was no longer part of it. It broke me apart.

The hardest part? Watching her try to sing along to her favorite hymn at church and totally get the melody wrong. She had her eyes closed, flushing with embarrassment, and I caught sight of tears she thought no one noticed. That was when I prayed, Lord, don't let her live in this silence. Show me the way.

A week later, in church service, one of the church sisters stopped me. She whispered to me gently, ""My aunt went through the same thing… try these, Oracle Hearing Aids. They helped her."" I did not hastily go out and buy them. I must admit, I was suspicious we'd already spent money on miracle equipment before, and I didn't want to be disappointed again. But I was desperate.

The first few days weren’t perfect. Mom said they felt strange, even a little overwhelming. Every sound felt too sharp, like the world was yelling at her after years of silence. She got frustrated, and I wondered if I’d made another mistake. But slowly, the sharpness softened.

During the third night, I whispered ""goodnight"" before I switched off the light. She tensed, fixed her eyes on me wide-open, and in a whisper said, ""I heard you."" This was the beginning.

Now she is able to hear the birds at morning, the hymn book pages rustling in church, even softness in my voice when I tell her I love her. It wasn't instant. It wasn't lightning. But slowly, slowly, silence gave way to sound.

To me, Oracle was more than a hearing aid. It was the answer to a prayer  not instantaneous, not perfect, but real. Proof that God answers sometimes in a whisper, through people, instruments, and names you can't ignore.

1nkyo0v,HearingLoss,Been having fluctuating hearing that improve after a day of high dose steroids,"For 2 years i have been having episodes of sudden ringing and muffled hearing that tends to recover the next day but recently I been noticing it's taking longer to recover. 

Just 4 weeks ago I came back from overseas with muffled hearing that developed out of nowhere and was put on 60mg prednisone for 7 days. Initially, the hearing came back on the 2nd day of the course but relasped when tapering to 20mg.

 I was put on another 20mg course for 4 days to try and salvage my hearing but no improvements. After the 20mg course, I went to the ER and was put on 40mg course which did help and I am now in the process of tapering off. Throughout the years, I been going in and out of the ENT hospital where the audiogram shows my hearing is within normal limits. 

Just wondering, for those with AIED or similar, 

1. how is the progression like. Do you guys deal with daily fullness that comes and goes and then one day it just persist. 

2. Do you start off with normal audiometry but with persistent muffling and tightness in the ear.

3. Do the fluctuations happen daily?

4. How do you get your ENT Doc to believe that you have these episodic hearing issue despite presenting with a normal audiogram at this point in time.

Sorry if this sounds insensitive but I am really worried that I might have AIED or Hydrops and might lose my hearing in about a month times. Just trying to get as much information as I can so I can better advocate for myself in my upcoming ent visit.

When the hearing dips, mostly my 2khz to 8khz sounds 2x softer when tested myself using audiogram website but when tested at the audiologist they say there is minimal changes.",2025-09-19 09:12:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nkyo0v/been_having_fluctuating_hearing_that_improve/

I just did a short YouTube test and I can barely hear 8kHz with the highest volume. When I was working on a lab in school today, my teammate told me to turn down a frequency generator hooked up to a mic at 7kHz, but I didn't hear a thing. 

Is this bad? I can understand conversations perfectly fine. I just seem to lose all ability to hear high frequency noises. I also hear a very faint high pitched noise when wearing earphones. With earphones off, ambient noise is enough to drown it out.

Is my hearing cooked? Is this fixable?

I have an android version and have hair discovered you can adjust the two settings. I didn't know if you can do that with an iPhone.  

Try looking under 

Settings.    
accessibility.      
Audio adjustment.      

Then set it to ""mono"" and adjust the slider.

Then you only need one complete set of airbuds.  The phone will adjust the settings.  It may take some fiddling around to get your preferred relative volume in each war.

Edit:  Make that a LOT of stuffing about!  

I hope that helps you overcome the volume control settings.

I think you can.

Look under accessibility, audio and visual, then scroll to the bottom - you can adjust the balance with a slider. This is on an iPhone 16.

Not sure if there is a 'maximum' volume with this though.

there is definitely settings to fully customize headphones and sound in accessibility on iphone. you can even set it to only play in your left ear",2025-09-19 01:52:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nkqv8y/i_need_help_with_iphone_settings/

1nk78dj,HearingLoss,Help needed,"Phonak Lumity, Sphere Infinio, or Infinio – which one is the best?

Audiologists are advising me to buy Lumity, saying it is safer due to its long track record. They also mention that Sphere Infinio and Infinio are not in stock in New Delhi, India. According to them, there were some issues with the Infinio lineup, so the stock was pulled from the market. Online and AI searches suggest there is a manufacturing shortage. Some say it is related to charging issues, while others mention that Sphere Infinio had voice processing problems because of AI.

I honestly don’t know how to comprehend all this. It is extremely confusing, and everyone seems to make it even worse. Things look uncertain in the Indian hearing aid sector—or perhaps I am missing something while sellers try to mislead buyers. There seems to be no proper trial policy either. At best, I am being offered 2–3 days of trial. Only Amplifon gave me 7 days of trial with Lumity. That experience was also not as satisfying as one would expect at such a high price point.

I am considering either the 70 or 90 models of Lumity or Infinio since their prices are almost the same. But if Sphere Infinio is indeed significantly superior (not just on paper, but in real, long-term use), I would be willing to pay extra for it.

1nk4hyo,HearingLoss,Hidden Hearing Loss or Psychosomatic?,"After attending a loud event for about 2 hours 6 weeks ago, I experienced muffled hearing in both ears that lasted for roughly a week and difficulty hearing in noisy areas like malls. A few days later, I went to an ENT. My PTA test came back normal, but the doctor said it was a temporary threshold shift (TTS). Since then, sounds feel a bit “off” — high-pitched tones especially sound weird, and I’ve noticed I’m slightly more sensitive to louder noises than before.

About 3 weeks later, a really loud door slam happened right next to my right ear, and that set off a new issue — I got this aural fullness feeling in that ear. It’s like pressure or blockage that doesn’t fully clear, which made me even more worried since it came on after that second noise exposure.

Went back to the ENT again, but my PTA still came back normal. The fullness is still there though, which has been really unsettling.

On week 6 from initial exposure, I decided to see an audiologist. They tested me for extended high frequencies (EHF) and otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and both came back normal — actually, my EHF was even better than average.

Out of curiosity I also tried the WHO SIN (speech-in-noise) test on the app, and I managed to complete it with 80-90 Score. So far, all the test results look normal, but subjectively my ears still don’t feel 100% — sounds can seem weird at times and I’m still slightly sensitive to louder noises. Speeches seems softer too in noisy areas like malls.

Could this be hidden hearing loss (HHL), or is it more likely psychosomatic/anxiety-related? Has anyone experienced something similar where the tests are fine but the ears don’t *feel* normal?

[댓글]
my understanding is its not HHL because speech in noise was normal. i understand maybe it feels different, but there are absolutely no signs of sny hearing loss.

1niu3pp,HearingLoss,Sudden Hearing Loss – My Story &amp; Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone,

On September 8, 2025, I was officially diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) in my left ear. The audiogram showed profound-to-severe loss, and right now I consider myself deaf in that ear. That means I’m suddenly living with unilateral hearing, and honestly, I’m still in shock.

Here’s what happened:
	•	August 12 – I went to urgent care with what they thought was an ear infection. I was put on antibiotics. That same night, I developed vertigo and nausea, ended up in the ER, and completely lost hearing in my left ear. I told the ER doctor, but he just said, “Don’t worry, it’ll come back.”
	•	The next week – My hearing still hadn’t returned, so I found an ENT online. He prescribed oral steroids and said recovery is a “wait and see” situation. Some people get their hearing back, some don’t.
	•	Treatment so far – I started oral prednisone about a week after the hearing loss, but I couldn’t tolerate it. The side effects were rough: blurry vision, extreme anxiety, insomnia, mood swings. I lasted only four days before stopping. My second ENT confirmed SSHL and offered either more oral steroids or ear injections. I chose the injections because I couldn’t handle the prednisone. I’m currently on my third intratympanic injection, with another hearing test scheduled in two weeks.
	•	MRI upcoming – The ENT at the hospital also ordered an MRI, which I’m scheduled to get next week. I’m anxious about that. They said this could have been triggered by a virus, but I keep wondering how a virus could damage my inner ear so suddenly—my cochlea, hearing nerve, or whatever it was.

Right now, I haven’t noticed improvement, but I know recovery is still possible. In the meantime, I’m struggling with:
	•	Adjusting to the imbalance of hearing only on one side.
	•	Anxiety, especially at night (since I lost my hearing at night and worry about emergencies with offices closed).
	•	Parenting my little one while trying to stay strong and communicative.
	•	Figuring out long-term options like CROS hearing aids, bone-anchored devices, or even cochlear implants if needed.
	•	Managing the anxiety while waiting on tests (breathing exercises help, but it’s still hard).

My questions for this community:
	•	How do you cope in the early stages of SSHL?
	•	If you didn’t recover hearing, what devices or strategies helped you the most?
	•	Any recommended resources or support groups in Illinois?

I know this might be my “new normal,” but I don’t want to just sit back and feel powerless. I want to stay proactive, informed, and find ways to keep living and working while adjusting to this major change.

Thanks for reading. Any advice, experiences, or resources would mean a lot.

My early stage was 30 years ago, but I remember the closed in feeling from suddenly not being able to hear and the anxiety.  I cope with everything with exercise, so I did that.  The prednisone was awful and II was anxious about the MRI, but mine (like most of ours) showed nothing.  My hearing improved some - went from flat out unable to hear anything to mod-severe over a few weeks - but what really helped was a hearing aid.  Even though I didn't get it all back and I don't have good speech recognition, just hearing the world on that side is super helpful.  Makes my head feel more normal.  

The early part is the worst.  I don't like having hearing loss, but it hasn't affected my career or important relationships.  I am VERY open about telling people about my hearing loss and requesting a certain spot at a table, that kind of thing.  It helps to be an active advocate for yourself.

I am so sorry you are dealing with this.  It can be overwhelming.

I experienced SSHL in early 2024, had the Prednisone tablets and 3 ear injections but unfortunately didn’t recover any hearing.

5 months later I went the Cochlear Implant route and I’m glad I did.

A few notes:

1)  Don’t beat yourself up regarding the delay in getting injections, as there aren’t any studies on the effectiveness of Prednisone (at least as of last year).

2)  Airpod Pros (not 1st gen) can be configured to help relay sound from your left side to your right ear.  It’s not perfect but it can help reduce the disorientation of not knowing which direction sound is coming from.

3)  An ENT with an in-house Audiologist can offer options based on your specific hearing loss.  This can include hearing aides (including CROS but they often aren’t covered by insurance, hence the Airpod Pro suggestion), or a Cochlear Implant.

Lean on this forum; there are some very supportive people here who want to help.

You can get through this!

This sounds like labyrinthitis. As the hearing and balance systems share the same nerve, when a virus causes inflammation along any given cranial nerve (aka neuritis), the nerve can swell quite a bit. For nerves like the ocular and vestibulocochlear (aka hearing and balance) nerve, they are in areas of the body with very limited space (the vestibulocochlear nerve is encased in bone -- the internal auditory canal), any inflammation of these nerves often results in significant sensory loss because there isn't room for them to expand when they're inflamed. While steroids are often efficacious, the severity of the inflammation is the determinate of whether the hearing can recover. If you push a watermelon through a child's small inner tube, you can usually force it through successfully without breaking the watermelon (the tube has some give). What inflammation does to the vestibulocochlear nerve can range from that all the way to trying to shove that same watermelon into a 12 oz. drinking glass (the watermelon gets pulverized because the container is rigid). 

  
I will say this very sternly, DO NOT GET A CROS FOR AN ACUTE SUDDEN HEARING LOSS. Cochlear implants are THE BEST option. All of my sudden hearing loss patients who were implanted with current arrays within 6 months of the onset of the hearing loss were UNDERSTANDING speech when I activated their cochlear implants (Advanced Bionics, Cochlear, and Med-El). I know I would be on that table in a freaking heart beat for a CI if I lost my hearing. They're even getting to the point to where music sounds okay with them as well (it used to be an absolute disaster). [https://www.medel.com/hearing-solutions/cochlear-implants/closest-to-natural-hearing](https://www.medel.com/hearing-solutions/cochlear-implants/closest-to-natural-hearing) The simulator is pretty far down at the bottom of the page, but the long array sound byte pretty darn close to how you will hear with a CI after 6 months of auditory rehabilitation if you get the correct array length. 

Your CI surgeon will make or break how well you do with the device. You want a surgeon who does at least 100 implants per year (if they do not do at least that many, find someone else). I know surgeons in CA, AZ, NM, IL, TX, OH, TN, NC, and GA that I can recommend if you want to consult with them.

Welcome to the club! And I'm so sorry that you're now in this club. yk the same happened to me (except my hearing loss was moderate level) but it still is a hearing loss. So, my ENT also said that it might be due to a virus (and literally I can't understand how) but mine loss is permanent. my other ear is fine, but it causes me anxiety like what if something happens to my good ear as well? And don't get me started on the tinnitus. I am 1 year and a few months in, and I guess things got better now. I adapted somehow. this is my new normal. and believe me, you'll feel better too. Hang in there.

I’m so sorry you have to go through this. Good for you for reaching out. 

This happened to my in February and is the most brutal thing I’ve gone though, to date. You didn’t mention any tinnitus/ringing or distortion. Is that true? If so, amazing!! 

I was researching all the options at first too after being profound also. I finally realized I had to stop and wait because my anxiety couldn’t handle it and take it one day at a time. I recommend that approach… it has really helped. 

I got on Zoloft for my anxiety - it helped with all the sound sensitivity and the over thinking things. This wasn’t a decision I took lightly, but I was in a very dark place and had so many weird side effects and symptoms. 

Best of luck. I hope you recover some hearing!!

Mine happened 6 weeks ago while walking in a store. Suddenly felt dizzy and couldn't hear. Went to b urgent care and was told fluid in one ear but no infection. Was prescribed 5 day course of oral steroids. When that didn't work I went to an ent who diagnosed me with ssnhl. Had one injection and hugh dose of oral steroids. 10 days later no change so dr stopped the injections. I read hyperbaric chamber showed some succes with ssnhl patients so requested referral from ent and he said he was willingto give it a chance. Have completed 5 visits of 20 so far and my hearing has improved 10 decibels in 3 frequencies (only lower frequencies have improved so far). Dr is now hopeful that after I complete the remaining 15 hbot visits my hearing will improve enough not to need hearing aids.  I strongly encourage you to ask about hyperbaric chamber. It is usually covered by insurance.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. It happened to me about a month ago now and I was having a lot of similar feelings of anxiety and disorientation. Also went through treatment one week after onset with minimal success unfortunately. I got some volume back in the lower frequencies, but I still have no speech sound recognition in my one ear so it doesn't help much. The first 3 weeks were by far the hardest in that it constantly bothered me and I felt like no one else really understood how hard it was to deal with it. Not to mention being in limbo with the outcome of your treatment and not knowing how things will turn out. It's really hard. I have two young children and I'm currently pregnant with twins so that has been an additional challenge, but also in a way a blessing because they force me to stay busy and active. For me, distraction and forcing myself to continue getting out and living my life has been the most useful way to get through this. The more activities I do (even if I feel uncomfortable), the more my brain is adjusting and I realize I CAN do this although it is a little bit harder. I am also in the process of exploring different assistive technology options. I'm about to get a trial with CROS next week and hoping to get a referral to an ENT to talk about the possibility of CI although it seems like a long process to get approved for. I have also reached out to just about all my friends and family now and let them know what's going on so that they are aware of it. That was a difficult step for me, because it made it feel like this change is ""real"" and permanent, but it was an important step in my acceptance. I'm also walking in this path so know you're not alone :) It hasn't been easy, but it is getting better with time.

So mine started one day after yours. Near total loss in left ear completely out of the blue. I’m on the prednisone, getting the injections, and doing daily hyperbaric oxygen sessions and hoping harder than I’ve ever hoped. I’m in Illinois, too, so if you hear anything about support groups, please share.

I’m so sorry to hear what you’re going through. I lost my hearing after a surgery in April. It was the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. I’m getting used to it now as far as the grieving part. I’ve been going to therapy and it’s helped me. I’m a court reporter - or was - and I’m not able to work at this point so financially it’s devastating as well. In your case, I’d continue to do your research, like you’re doing. The acceptance will take time but it seems you still have some time for something to change. I read on this thread about the hyperbaric chamber. Not sure how successful that really is but it might be worth a shot. I wish I had known about it early on. I’m sure it’s too late now for me.  From what I’ve learned about in the CI forums, it’s better to do it sooner than later if that’s the route you end up going. I’m glad you’re getting an MRI. Hopefully that will give you some more solid info. Best of luck to you!!

I’m 37. No help with the Illinois aspect or really recommendations on treatment. I had existing tinnitus in my left ear due to noise exposure. This summer, my right ear reduced to 25%. The right was previously perfectly fine and I had my hearing previously tested in both ears due to my left ear. Initially dismissed as an infection despite my insistence it was something more, then a few rounds of treatment and specialists with limited to no progress. I’m not thrilled and I’m not hopeful that it will recover. On the bright side there are a lot of treatment options that I haven’t exhausted and the assistive technology is pretty good based on what has been told to me. The adjustment period was intense. Hang in there.

This has just happened to me. Woke up Tuesday deaf in my left ear. Can’t see the ENT until Monday. I’m scared.",2025-09-16 21:17:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1niu3pp/sudden_hearing_loss_my_story_looking_for_advice/

1niiqbh,HearingLoss,App and audiologist difference due to patients outside,"Hello,

Today I went to an audiologist to take hearing test. During the test, there were sounds coming into the cabin from outside which sometimes distracted me and I wasn’t sure of myself another thing was my breathing because I’ve got the best heartburn that pushes my diaphragm and today is not the best day for me.

According to test results, nearly everything is okay.

250 is around 15db in both ears, everything is below 10db until 6k which is around 10 in one ear, and 20 in the other. 8k is around 30db 
in both.

However, I have not noticed any difference in my hearing so far. Last years both ears were around 10db at 8k and I had a very strong tinnitus which I was able to hear even when I was listening to music. These days I don’t even hear it.

When I came home, I found Mimi test online and took it with AirPods 2nd gen. 

250 is just below 10db in both ears and 8k is around 10db. 

I see that the app can be inaccurate and I can gladly accept it, it can be 15db in reality but app may show 10. However I’m concerned about that 8k. 20db difference is something big.

BTW during the official test they used a gadget to give sound through bone? And they told me some words and I repeat them during which the next patient ordered some tea and one asked if there was time to smoke 😅

Right AC: 5, BC: 3, AI 99
Left AC: 8, BC: 3, AI 97

I am still green when it comes to testing, but a hearing aid user of 16 years. (I am only in second year practitioner degree here!) 

But I would be weary of air pods being able to give you a solid 8k frequency that comes close to that of a full set up. 8k becomes hairy with the bone conductor. (The gadget that was placed on your head)

Tbh, I wouldn't chalk it up to a issue, mostly due to the variables in the hardware, which can really matter.

From what I’m learning on this sub, anything 20db or less is normal hearing and 30 would be mild loss.",2025-09-16 14:16:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1niiqbh/app_and_audiologist_difference_due_to_patients/
1nihelg,HearingLoss,Are there counselors that specialize in people with hearing loss?,"If you've spent any decent amount of time in this sub, you've seen numerous posts about people who could use some counseling regarding hearing loss. This begs the question...

**Are there any mental health counselors who specialize in working with people with hearing loss?**

While audiologists can play this role to a degree, its not sufficient. Many people with hearing loss need more robust counseling to help them process the impacts to their daily life and mental wellbeing. Plus, the impending doom that it's going to get worse.

Given the significant increase in remote mental health counseling, this seems like a niche market in which this sub (i.e. you) can help others out by pointing to some excellent mental health counselors.

I am a therapist with hearing loss! Some people specialise more in working with people with hidden disabilities etc, but ultimately it depends on what your goal is, why would you be looking for therapy, then you could find a therapist, who specialises in that. 
I specialise in working with people on the spectrum for example, but I would happily support someone with hearing loss and if I did, I would read additional research

I have had a few therapists since COVID . For finding a therapist and better for therapists , I have never came across someone that specializes in hearing loss .

However therapists are trained to deal with pretty much everything. As well if someone is specialized or doesn't necessarily they are the best for your situation .

I found a therapist that was highly recommended for personal issues I experience.  She specialized in my issues. 

She was good don't get me wrong . However i found a new therapist and she is a way better fit for me . Helped my situation way more and isn't specialized. So I wish you good luck in finding a therapist or anyone else that's looking.

There are a couple of online therapy services that specifically work with signing Deaf clients:

https://nationaldeaftherapy.com/

https://deafcounseling.com/

If the person does not sign, searching on psychologytoday.com for a therapist who uses sign language will likely find someone familiar with deafness/hearing loss issues even if they prefer speaking.

In Canada: https://www.chs.ca/counselling

Interesting question. i am a therapist and over the past 5 years my hearing has been dwindling away. I sought out some counseling for the grief. She does a fine job at the general counseling, but does miss grasping the feeling of doom of what is likely coming socially, occupationally, and financially depending on how far this progresses and the wait and outcome of perhaps a future cochlear implant. Your question got me thinking, and gave me a bit of something to distract myself from the ringing in my ears and my own negative loop of doom- so I put together a topic list/treatment plan plan covering the topics that would have been helpful for me. I have included this here. Any additions or suggestions would be great. The main challenge of telehealth is licensure and payment/insurance issues for crossing state lines. But I can cover four states (midwest). 

1. My story (progression of hearing loss)

2. My fears

3. How do I tell people around me?

4. My supports (people, professionals, and technology)

5. Coping skills 

6. My grief journey (can't be me/why me; bargaining- ""if only""; anger/sadness; isolation/loneliness)

7. Losses and feared losses

8. Coping with intrusive thoughts- the negative loop of doom 

9. Meaning, purpose, and belonging- who am I now and where do I fit

10. Now what? What can I do today?

11. Future plans?

12. How do I accept this, today and each day to come?

13. Managing ongoing grief and building a new positive view of self

I live in Minnesota USA.  My state has a Dept for Deaf, Deaf/blind, and Hard of Hearing.  They referred me to a therapist specializing in hearing loss.  I start next Wed.  I'm hoping that therapists who are getting referrals to help people with hearing loss just get better at what they do as they deal with lots of people like me.  You might start now finding the resources available to you.  Agencies helping hundreds,  maybe thousands of people, with hearing loss have a handle on our issues. My agency referred me to a therapist, is helping me appeal the insurance company denial of coverage for a cochlear implant, and gave me a list of movie theaters catering to deaf and hard of hearing.

1nhytos,HearingLoss,is this a symptom of hearing loss?,"for context: i’m technically diagnosed with moderate hearing loss (aged 14, now 19), however it happened in one appt, i was never offered a follow up, i only found out about the dx a few months ago and i havnt chased it as i don’t want to look silly or attention seeky (i have other issues and often feel like i’m wasting gp time yknow).

so my hearing can be meh, normally i’m fine enough as long as someone is facing me and it’s not too loud. however i also have times of really ‘good’ hearing (idk how to put it). let’s say someone mumbles, when no one else understands them i know/ can figure out what they’re saying from the sounds they make and context. could this be due to overcompensation(?) learnt from the possible hearing loss or is it more likely to be processing as i can understand people when basically no one else can?

if this isn’t the right place for this, please let me know and apologies :)))

Seems like you'd benefit from a new hearing test. It has been five years (a long time!) Ask the person that tests you to explain your results.

[댓글]
So sorry to hear that you've had no improvement in 2 months. Hope is not lost. My ent told me a story of a patient who had tried steroids (both oral and injections) with no change in symptoms. They stopped treatment and he assumed her ssnhl was permanent only to receive a call from her 6 months later stating she woke up and hearing had returned.  So don't give up on yourself.

You can hope for the best while preparing to deal with your current reality.  I spent the better part of my first year in a holding pattern while we made the case for a cochlear implant. We made the medical case but insurance declined it anyway.  So I lost a lot of time.  Reddit members kept encouraging therapy to help deal with everything.  I wish I had started that immediately.   My state in the USA has a department for Deaf/deaf-blind/and Hard of hearing.  They provided lots of resources and helped me identify questions I didn't even know to ask.  I was put on a wait list and am finally seeing a therapist who specializes in helping people with hearing loss.  Boy do I wish I'd started this sooner.


Knowledge is your best friend.  If your hearing improves, you are a lot more informed.  If it doesn't, then you have started a hearing loss journey.  The good news is that you get through it and learn how to adapt. For me, it was a challenge to help work peers and friends deal with me while I was still learning what everything meant myself.  I experienced loss, grief, and a lot of worry about how my disability would affect my ability to continue to be a manager of a phone bank.  It's amazing what you can do with the help of technology and a lot of self confidence.

I woke up a little over two weeks ago and could barely hear out of my right ear, the tinnitus was immense. 

ENT visit basically came to the conclusion I have lost hearing in my right ear… 

I can’t attribute this to anything other than loud music in my headphones all my life and in my car. I’m 25… 
I thought it was wax build up. This was a wake up call for me. I am suffering and it is all my fault.

See a different ENT!! This sounds more like SSNHL and is similar to what happened to me. You need to start a course of steroids or have them injected into your year yesterday. The longer you wait there less chance your hearing could return at least a little. Don’t wait, call a different ENT today!!

""I have a history of **otitis in 2012** in my right ear, which left me with **mild tinnitus** as a sequela.

**After almost 13 years (approx. 2025)**, I had a new acute episode:

* Upon waking up, I noticed a **new tinnitus tone** in the same ear.
* An audiometry test confirmed a **20 dB hearing loss**.

**My current symptoms** are:

1. **Recruitment or algiacusis:** Loud sounds or harsh voices sound **distorted (like a broken speaker)** and are **painful** to me.
2. **Loss of clarity:** I perceive **fewer sounds at the same time**, which makes understanding speech difficult, especially in noisy environments.
3. Despite having taken care of my ear after the initial otitis, I have developed this **new hearing loss**.""

Oh my goodness! Please don’t internalize this as something you did “wrong”. Noise induced hearing loss is very unusual to be in only one ear without a clear cause. Audiologist and music lover here…. My car is one you hear down the block, but it’s about noise dose: Louder noise, smaller dose.

I go to doctors. They can’t see anything. Must be inner ear.  Nothing they can do. Ear is ringing unbearably. Prescribed me medication I can’t get in Canada. (SERC) 

I go back in a week. Ear still feels full, like cotton stuck. 

“If it still feels wrong in 2 more weeks let me know. “

I let home know.  2 months later, hearing test.

What’s worst though is the ringing, the pain most sounds cause. My one daughter’s voice is nasally and I wince every time she talks. It breaks my heart and she notices. 

I can’t listen to music in the car and even audio books are only tolerable if it’s a male narrator. 

I was nearly in tears. Hearing…hurts. I wear an ear plug in my right ear when I go out with my kids, for dinner, etc.  I don’t listen to music.

1nh5z1v,HearingLoss,Moderate to Severe,"I'm 33. I recently discovered I have moderate to severe hearing loss. Three years ago it was mild to moderate. I've spent my whole life struggling with hearing issues. By the time I was 15 I gave up on hearing the TV clearly and watched with subtitles. If I know I'll be watching movies or series without subtitles I'll just look up the plot because otherwise I won't be able to figure it out because I can't hear it. 

I run a register at work sometimes and if I had a dollar for everytime someone has gotten irritated at me for not being able to hear I could buy an island to move to. Especially since we ask everyone for a phone number.

What is confusing to me and the audiologists is the hearing loss is consistent with trauma to the head. I have no memory of such trauma. Also the hearing loss is beginning to accelerate as I get older. 

I tried on hearing aids for the first time last week and almost cried because I realized the sounds I have gotten used to not hearing. Once I took them off I could only hear two sounds again and I felt the loss more. I cannot afford the hearing aids and almost wish I had not tried them on. 

I'm heartbroken. .

I'm sorry. If its bilaterally symmetrical loss, maybe its genetic hearing loss?

Look at buying apple AirPods. They're much cheaper than HAs. You can upload an audiogram and it will adjust the settings to account for your losses.

Yes tell us what kind of loss you have. 
It can help figure out what kind of aids may work
Can you do a go fund me to raise money for your hearing aids? 
Maybe the trauma was internal like a medication?
Try asking chat gpt!
I’m trying to get a hearing aid since June. It keeps getting more and more complicated. 
Can you just ask people to write down their phone number when you ring the register?
I’m sorry you are dealing with this!
I have hearing loss and vision problems! If that makes you feel better! Can you see normally? You have many things going for you!
Hang in there! 
I hope you get aids soon!

I'm so sorry. Hearing aides are very expensive, and I don't know how much you can afford. I have moderate to severe hearing loss also and used to pay $6000 a pair (with help from family). My most recent pair is from Costco and were $1600 for the pair and charger. I understand this is still a lot of money that not everyone can afford, but in case you could manage that amount, I wanted to let you know. There are also over the counter hearing aids that are under $1000 that might help. You'd want to be sure to research and work with a company that offers a trial period and no-cost returns.  Another possible option is a charity that provides hearing aids like Lions Club or Hearing Aid Project if you qualify as low income.  Best of luck in finding a way to improve your hearing.

[댓글]
I was mentioning this to my hubs this morning. I understand wanting to come to this sub for advice, because that’s what I did when I was first actually diagnosed and got hearing aids. I count myself as fortunate that I can function without them. But I absolutely get annoyed with people coming here with charts that show normal hearing and detailing why they disagree with the chart. It’s definitely a “read the room” or “you’re in the wrong room” situation sometimes.

I respectfully disagree. Hearing loss of any amount is a huge mental struggle. It affects all aspects of your life and is inescapable. I can understand those who are newly affected who want to reach out for any support and information available, especially as doctors may not be giving them the support they are expecting or need.

Hearing loss isn't a competition.

This isn't some competition that people need to quality for according to ***your*** standards. Just fyi.

I've been over 50% since I was 13 years old and went through chemo and it caused chemical nerve damage, resulting in hearing loss that hearing aids can't help, because it's mostly in the high frequency range. 

I can't hear people talk, about 40% of the time, even if they're right next to me and there's no party going on at all. I'm completely ""tone deaf"" and don't hear (I'm sure) the majority of what other people hear when they listen to music. I've been mocked/made fun of countless times in my life for being deaf.

Are people supposed to throw me a pity party that I'm unaware of, for winning the ""cancer jackpot which resulted in deafness at a young age""? Do I somehow qualify to judge your - or anyone else's - hearing loss now, or how it affects you/them?? Should I be ""annoyed"" at an older person went deaf later in life but thinks they're ""in the same boat"" as me??🤔 Or should I be ""angry"" at ***you*** because at least you qualify for cochlear implants, and hearing aids, when I can't get any help for my hearing loss and it has progressed to where I'm now closer to 70% deaf, and I've had to spend my lifetime adapting and reading lips??

Like do you even hear yourself? 

Get grief counselling or something if you're grieving the loss of your hearing and the changes in your life, but dumping it on people who are going through things of their own, and telling people off on Reddit for ""not being as deaf as you"" - in a sub meant to be kind and supportive to all with any type or form of hearing loss - is a sure sign you need some help in processing this and dealing with it.

i dont think saying your hearing loss is the only “real” hearing loss (profound deafie here). i also get extremely annoyed by people with normal audiograms on here, but lets not invalidate others WITH hearing loss. all hearing loss effects speech and our lives in different ways. this group is for hearing loss, not just severe hearing loss. it seems like you have a lot of frustration with your own situation, but please be kind to others

I’ve gone from normal to moderately severe at most in 6 months and I’m also annoyed seeing people freaking out over small discrepancies. I see their audiograms and wish I could just go back to before I turned 36

I'm so sorry you feel that way. I really am. We're all humans here, right? So, I totally understand and acknowledge those feelings of yours being frustrated and sick of seeing those close to normal hearing results (compared to yours). I feel that way too. 

But my hearing loss isn't proper hearing loss. Like apparently it doesn't affect my daily life, and the audiologist as well as the ENT, these guys didn't even recommend me the hearing aids. My one ear is totally fine, the other has like 55-60db loss. AND it took a tool on my mental health and my self-esteem. It IS A BIG DEAL to me. It SIGNIFICANTLY affected my QOL. And YES, DON'T EVEN MENTION THE T. So, even if my hearing loss isn't YET considered a disability, it still IS a disability to me. I can't properly locate sounds, I struggle in groups, I have to put so much of effort into trying to listen to someone talking over my bad ear. It IS a never ending struggle, EVEN if you guys don't consider it a proper hearing loss. I'm so sorry.

Why not re-name your Sub to a threshold, for example “&gt;40 dB at any frequency” if you don’t want to deal with minor or ‘normal’ impairment rather than just ranting? I’d love to see a channel that has folks willing to help newly impaired folks understand hearing loss world - it was new to most of us at some point in our lives!

I agree for the most part.

My hearing loss at the current time is relatively mild. I've had surgery for otosclerosis and my hearing loss has by and large been corrected to the point where I don't need hearing aids and I can even do audio production work. 

However, before I had my first stapedectomy, I was struggling. I was at the point where I needed hearing aids to function normally.

I mainly post here because I think my experience has been valuable. I can offer insight and advice.

I’m sorry you have lost so much hearing and suffer from tinnitus so badly. I have a loss of 60% in my left ear, but more importantly, the sound I hear is just sound. It makes no sense to my brain, and as a result, I have 0% comprehension in the left ear. The right ear has normal high frequency loss typical for a 73 year old that has been exposed to occasional loud sounds. 

Do I feel guilty because I have hearing in one ear? No, I don’t. I would love to have “normal hearing and not have a sound processor hanging on the side of my head. Little kids look at me and whisper in their parents ears while looking at me, makes me feel like I have a third eye. But I don’t get upset about it. I can’t change the way things are, and I can’t change public opinion. 

We all need to realize we each have our own path to walk, and such, we need to get over our self pity.

It annoys me as a hearing mum of a deaf son. Have you tried the r/Deaf sub?

I know you realize to some extent it's just a rant and everyone is entitled to their own suffering. I have a 30dB hearing loss in the 4000hz range. I also struggle with auditory processing and attention. I feel handicapped and I'm obsessed about it. So I guess the suffering linked to your hearing loss is not only measured in the dB.

I agree OP. You're not alone with these thoughts.

I hear you there ! Just diagnosed last week and I have mild and then at higher tones I am moderately severe loss.  Makes hearing people with higher pitch such as women more difficult 

Seen some charts and was like I'd be happy with their hearing.  But like anything else it's what people do.  Like my daughter was in the NICU for 3 months . Then my sister had a baby and was in the NICU for 4 days after being rushed to NICU.   She was like I know what it's like to have a child on the NICU.  I said to myself no you don't.  It's like they want to feel included.

Hearing loss is more complicated than an audiogram and is only a part of the picture. It’s unfortunate you feel that way because hearing loss is often a confusing journey that may start with a “normal” test. Just because you’re suffering in your own unique doesn’t mean that other people aren’t suffering in a unique way that you can’t understand.

What do you mean: minus 80dB hearing loss, while ""seeing normal test results"". is impossible. do you have an audiogram to post in here? how do you reached the conclusion you have a 80dB hearing loss if your audiogram is ""normal'?",2025-09-14 19:10:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ngzxu1/normal_hearing_in_a_hearing_loss_sub/

I knew I had a hearing loss beforehand (family history of ear issues) but I also have hyperacusis since developing ME in 2018 and consequently have to wear earplugs a lot, so I don’t really want to invest in hearing aids at this point.

The shaded area is where the equipment no longer passes sounds (due to physical sound issues). It's not relevant to you.

Excuse my poor writing, I'm REALLY anxious.

I (M17) have suffered severe acoustic trauma two months ago which started without tinnitus, a few days later tinnitus occured but it went away over time and somehow my hearing recovered by like, 90%. Everything was fine up until nine days ago, when an ambulance drove right past me and I didn't manage to cover my ears. I don't have any hearing loss from it (as far as I'm concerned), but hearing in my left ear is distorted, I have aural fullness, I have a burning sensation in the left ear and on top of that I have a weird tinnitus which sounds like a servo motor. It constantly changes tone and is reactive. Sound is also echoing in my left ear and has an overtone. My hearing is still fine and as sensitive as before, but now I can't understand people talking further away from my left side, even if I'm hearing them talk. Is this nerve damage? Has anyone recovered from this? I've been to an ENT, she said my eardrum is retracted so maybe that's causing it??? Worst of all, I've had a MRI yesterday (without hearing protection) which confirmed my wisdom tooth is causing tinnitus in my right ear (the one unaffected by the situation I'm writing about). Could the MRI noise worsen things? I'm completely lost, I've been playing instruments my whole life and I'm a member of a well known choir in my city, is my career ruined? I've been prescribed methylprednisolone and a large dose of vitamin B, I have protected my ears from everything but my parents forced me to have the MRI and I just don't know what to do. I started to get auditory hallucinations a few days ago from the stress and I feel like I'm gonna end up in a psychiatric ward if things will continue. I've lost most of my friends because I didn't want to go out with them the entire summer not to make my hearing worse, my grades went down and I'm just so lost. Please has someone recovered from something like this I need to know.

Can you post your hearing test? Also, anxiety can cause or aggravate all of your described symptoms so do what you can to address that and you will see a big improvement in your symptoms.

How did they confirm through MRI that your wisdom tooth is causing the tinnitus? Is it putting pressure on the trigeminal or another facial nerve? Was it an MRI of the brain or auditory canals? Sometimes issues with the jaw and neck can cause this, especially if your tinnitus changes tone in different positions.

I’m 24 years old and I’ve struggled with my ears my whole life. I’ve had 4 sets of tubes as well as had my adenoids removed when I was 6 as an attempt to help with the ear infections. I’ve had many hearing tests in the past, most recently when I was 18. My tests have never raised any serious red flags. However within the last 3 years I’ve noticed a change in my hearing, specifically my right ear. I wear a headset at work and I’ve noticed that if I wear the headset on my “good ear” everything sounds like it’s underwater and I can hardly make out what my coworkers are saying to me. I rely on lip reading when following along to a conversation and I constantly ask people to repeat themselves, which I know can get irritating.  I’ve been looking into getting hear aids for a few months now. I need something affordable but will still be able to help me.

Has anyone ever used this product? Or is there something else you might recommend that won’t break my bank? I really appreciate it",2025-09-10 19:13:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ndnh9d/looking_for_advice_about_hearing_aids_first_time/
1ndlvxy,HearingLoss,"Coping with genetic hearing loss, tinnitus, and parenting very loud young kids — advice?","Hi everyone,

I’m struggling and hoping for advice or even just shared experiences. I have genetic hearing loss related to a GJB2/Connexin 26 mutation, which also causes rough/thickened skin on the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. Along with this, I deal with constant tinnitus, and my hearing is gradually getting worse.

Here’s the problem: I have two young kids, and my preschooler (incredibly bright, but also very vocal) screams and yells often — as kids do. I completely understand this is developmentally normal and that young children don’t have strong impulse control yet. But the noise is destroying me.
   •   Noise-cancelling headphones/earbuds help to an extent, but I can’t wear them all day (my ears and head get sore, and it isolates me).
   •   Hearing aids make it worse in these moments — amplified screaming is unbearable, and I have to rip them out.
   •   I’ve tried everything to manage the behavior: explaining gently, begging, getting angry, crying, trying to model quiet, but none of it sticks.

On top of this, I already carry a heavy load: I’m medicated for depression and anxiety, likely have ADHD (not yet diagnosed), and I’m in therapy (including EMDR for severe childhood trauma, PTSD from a violent father, and an emotionally neglectful mother).

I’m scared. I don’t know how to protect what hearing I still have or how to manage the emotional toll. I think I may need to start grief work around becoming deaf, but I don’t know where to begin.

So I guess my questions are:
   •   How do other parents with hearing loss manage the screaming/noise stage?
   •   Are there coping tools or strategies that help protect both hearing and mental health?
   •   Has anyone here gone through therapy specifically around the grief of losing hearing, and did it help?

I love my kids and want to be present for them, but I feel like I’m unraveling. Any advice, resources, or just understanding would mean the world.

the episode was weird. i could still hear, but everything was muffled and ringing, like hearing through a broken speaker. i also heard myself very loudly on the affected side (right). i got a panic attack and considered calling 911, but my mom made me do breathing exercises and it subsided a lot. i’d say i recovered about 80% of my hearing during those 30 minutes, and now it just feels “off”. no worsening, i hear birds, crickets, and voices loud and clear, but it sounds as if they’re being played from a speaker that still isn’t fully cleared yet.

does that sound like SNHL? should i wait until tomorrow or go to an emergency room? the affected ear isn’t dead, it hears even when i cover the good one, it’s just off, hence why i’m going to ent to get it evaluated.",2025-09-10 12:35:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ndczd2/snhl_or_something_else/

I’m 21 years old. The audio gram attached is not the only one I took I have another with a 20 DB loss at 4K HZ

My story: About 8 weeks ago I was diagnosed with an “Ear Infection” after going to the ER for sudden hearing loss. He was incorrect after speaking to an ENT and it looks like I have Sensoneurial hearing loss. My symptoms are muffledness in the right ear, aural fullness, and hypercaucus, much difficultly understanding language.

I have had T on both ears since I was about 11 years old. To be honest throughout my entire childhood I abused my ears with loud music etc. Now I’m facing the consequences I keep telling myself it can be worse. Yet I’m very depressed and feel alone.

I will have to adjust my life so that situations are much more bareable. I thank God everyday that he gave me the opportunity of life yet I took it for granted. 

Btw music kinda sucks now, shows suck, conversations anywhere loud suck, I gotta suck it up and keep moving f*ck this depression.

I’m an audiophile, okay done ranting. Protecting my ears btw now guys much love. ❤️

20 db is not a loss, you actually have great hearing thresholds throughout. absolutely no sensorineural hearing loss at this time. your left ear is especially fantastic

could be higher frequency loss (they only test up to 8khz because thats the highest area for speech, but music can have higher pitches) or could just be a touch of hidden hearing loss based on the slight issue with word recognition at 50db, but 50db is still quieter than every day conversations

anyways, it doesnt scream noise exposure to me, and no hearing loss outside of possibly a bit of hidden loss on the right purely based on your experience

I feel like this too. Ever since the episode when my hearing went muffled for about 30 minutes, I feel like my hearing’s been “off”. They didn’t call it SSHL since I was in the 0-15 db threshold. It’s hard to explain since I pick up on sound just fine, but it’s absolutely driving me insane since everything has different quality.",2025-09-10 07:28:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1nd7q2u/nihlhidden_hearing_loss/

Cochlear implants are amazing these days. I read that athletes can use them but I don’t know your particular details. Worth looking into. Hopefully you can use them and will just carry on as normal after an adjustment period

Took me probably a week or week and a half of deep anguish to get used to it…helped I had a 4 month old baby I had to look after, so I was kept busy and couldn’t wallow as much. Also, my tinnitus wasn’t terrible. Get the steroid shots though. They’re unpleasant but they increased my word recognition from 0% 5 weeks ago to 68% today.

I am sorry you're going through a rough  time ! As well dealing with hearing loss. 

I have noise induced hearing loss . Moderately severe , it sucks and have a lot of regret for not taking hearing protection more seriously ! I understand we have different hearing loss.  But we have both lost hearing abilities , not all but some.  

I just got diagnosed last week Thursday actually ! Dealing with regret and the pitty party for myself.  It is unfortunate but realized it could always be worse.   I lost my five year older cousin to cancer this summer.  So it can always get worse ! I understand feeling bad , sad , regret what ever.  Just keep in mind life can always be worse

learn sign language as quickly as possible. grief is totally normal, but i promise it wont feel this big forever. even if it doesnt improve, it will become your normal. hearing loss is unlikely to effect athletics. best of luck!! &lt;3

Do not despair, I want you to know it can get 100% better, all the way, yet could take weeks or even months.

I had this happen and was given prednisone too. Major deafness in my left ear suddenly, and lasted days. The ENT told me 60% it would recover, and it did but took over 3 months. There was lingering tinnitus for awhile, but I could pretty much hear as before (and no longer suffering mentally), and over the next few months the tinnitus also receded until I couldn't even hear it.

I want to tell you: it absolutely can get completely back to normal, and there's a great chance you'll be completely fine, so take deep breaths, try to distract yourself from it, and be patient.

Not likely to be noise induced hearing loss. Noise induced hearing loss is typically a notch centered around 6k. Google image search ""noise induced hearing loss"" and compare what those audiograms look like against yours. 

This could be age related hearing loss (presbycusis) or some type of congenital condition. Hard for anybody on reddit to say for sure.

Did you ever have your hearing tested before and if so has your hearing gotten worse over time or has this high frequency roll off always been there?

Your doctor might be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis. Did they?

It's not much to be too concerned about now but you should monitor it to see how it might progress.

Whoa this audiogram is exactly like mine. It starts to drop off at 8k - 16k. What symptoms are you having?

I'm still trying to accept it. Bass still sounds good but mids and highs sound distorted, flat and tinny. Can't wrap my head around the fact that this is permanent and I'll never experience full rich sounding music again.

Lost hearing in my left ear about 15 years ago due to a virus. Nothing will bring the hearing back. I use to LOVE listening to music thru headphones. Can’t begin to describe how heartbroken I was that that was taken away. Some companies do make earbuds, headphones

Messed that up…some companies, ScanSound, for instance, make earbuds, headphones, etc. that promise full stereo sound in a single earbud or headphone, but it’s not even close. To this day, I am angry, disappointed, etc. that my music was taken away

They might do it for you there and then but being the NHS I presume you'll have to wait. I wasn't even told about steroids at my appointment. This was 2 and a half weeks after onset of symptoms. It was members on here that told me to go back and request them. Got the oral steroids at 3 wks from onset. Again people on here told me to fight for the steroid injections which I did but my original ENT referred me to his colleague for this who only did the injections after another hearing test which showed slight improvement. How long since you lost your hearing? Have you any other symptoms?

Just FYI - there's not the same sense of urgency about the MRI. It's mainly to look for a tumor in the covering of the auditory nerve that's rare but not so rare you're unlikely in your life to meet someone who's ever had it. They're not generally fast growing, so you'd have to have a very, very rare thing going on for a few weeks to matter. The rest of the initial stuff IS urgent.

I went to an emergency ENT appointment in September 2024 (Newcastle area).  
At that appointment, I had a hearing test and a tympanometry test. I then sat in the waiting room for about 20 minutes, spoke with an ENT, and received a prescription for oral steroids. I was also told that I would receive a letter for an MRI appointment within the next few weeks, and that I would be booked back into the ENT clinic within six weeks. I had an MRI two weeks after my initial ENT appointment, then attended another ENT appointment four weeks later.

At my second ENT appointment, I had another hearing test and then received a steroid injection. I was supposed to be booked in for two more injections (once every two weeks), but the ENT clinic kept cancelling my appointments. My final appointment was supposed to be a discussion about hearing aids, but my hearing recovered prior to my final appointment.

Unlike you, the two walk-in clinics and my GP really dropped the ball, so I didn't start steroids until my first ENT appointment (two weeks after HL).

So... I never got to see ENT today as when my GP contacted they denied they agreed to see me and said they had no clinic even to see me in. 

I've had to immediately discontinue the oral steroids as it's triggering my mental health. I should have automatically been offered the injection due to the contraindication but ENT said to my GP I can't have until I have an auditory examination and further to that an ENT appointment. They don't know even when the auditory appointment will be. So I'm off all steroids. 

I went to my local audiology service and they have found not only the hearing loss in the right ear but also some in the left. I did think on waking todaybinhad some also in the left but brushed it aside as not being correct and just getting used to not hearing with the right ear. I've no idea how fast the hearing loss will progress with the left ear given how swift it was to disappear from the right one overnight. Its pretty scary. The GP has sent the private auditory exam to ENT and updated about losing hearing in the second ear overnight but it's not caused me to be seen by ENT. The walk in centre today did also try and call ENT about the second ear but couldn't directly get through as nobody answering.

1naxwix,HearingLoss,Please be cautious of getting microsuction from an ENT,"I want to caution people against getting microsuction from an ENT, or at least do extensive research. I had perfect hearing and protected my ears my whole life, just to ironically have an ear, nose, and throat doctor cause tinnitus, hyperacusis, and ETD. Having spoken with a head audiologist at the Center for Hearing and Communication in NY, she said that she has seen other cases like mine from microsuction. She advised me not to write about my experience online because she said that it could be harmful to my mental health. I believe instead that those with knowledge should inform others of the risks involved with this procedure. I will never stop sharing my experience.

I've heard this so many times - it's not uncommon.

I can't believe there are still ENTs who still do micro suction. If I, as a lay person, am aware of the risks - you'd think a doctor (who specialises in the ear!), would also be aware. Its baffling.

I think it should be considered malpractice.

It is so incredibly loud. I have severe hearing loss, like 70 db threshold, and even for me it is painfully loud.

It just happened to me. And now I have to get hearing aids because of that procedure. My hearing was slightly off before the suction cleaning and afterwords my hearing became worse.

I’m doing a little asking before I head off to my doctor to get tested. 

I’m starting to hear really faint music when my wife turns on the fan in the next room. She sleeps earlier than I do. When it goes on I can almost hear very very faint music. It’s actually pretty calming and does not scare me in the slightest. I researched this is the brains way of trying to make sense of different frequencies. 

Though I find it calming I would be foolish not to take it seriously. Have many of you experience this. I will get checked but just fishing to hear similar experiences.

Thanks everyone 👍🏻

Hey, good on you for taking it seriously while keeping a level head.

I have this with my tinnitus. As my hearing got a bit worse with age I started hearing phantom big band music at night. At first I thought my neighbor was binge watching 60s TV. Once I found out it was likely auditory hallucinations, it stopped happening as often. Around the same time, I went on blood pressure meds and stopped drinking.

1n9vxr3,HearingLoss,Should I get a hearing aid? (unilateral snhl),"Audiogram said I had moderately severe high frequency sensorineural hearing loss in my right ear. The chart dips at 3k 20db; 4k-6k 60db; 8k 50db. It floats around 5-15dB for other frequencies. Left ear is fine, 5-10db. 

ENT doctor was a very succinct old man. Did not say anything about hearing aids (either needing them or not needing them) so idk where to go from here. The appt was rushed so I forgot to ask.

I don't feel particularly bothered, but I don't really know if I'm missing out on anything. I am 21, still in college, and reliant on parents' funding. I don't want to trouble them. I'm not very good at academics, so working part time to get the money might make a dent on my grades. Should I look into hearing aids or can I just carry on as I am? If anything, I might save up little by little to get one in a few years if it's recommended.

not sure where you're at, but where I live in the US people go to audiologists to get recommendations on HAs. We see ENTs to make sure there is nothing else going on that HAs would not address.

ENTs are very knowledgeable about hearing aids. You don't necessarily find an audiologist first but get a second opinion from a better doctor. 

May I ask when your sshl happened?

I think I'd definitely trial a HA with those readings.

1n9q0pu,HearingLoss,"Saw an ENT and was told it was ""normal""","I am 17, afab, and have had tinnitus since I was 12. It started because I damaged my ears with very loud music in headphones.

As a baby I had nonstop ear infections so I had tubes put in. The tubes fell out on their own. Recently I had an ear infection in both ears for over two weeks. I saw an ENT and he told me I have dry ears. They did a hearing test and he said I have lost the ability to hear high notes. He said ""Everyone loses it eventually, you just so happened to lose it at 17."" That doesn't seem normal!

My hearing has been degrading for a couple years. I really noticed a difference at 15, I couldn't understand the words people were saying to me unless they were looking at me and/or talking loudly. I am the designated ""WHAT?"" friend because I dont understand what people are saying. 

This all feels abnormal to me. I'm 17 with degrading hearing and increasing tinnitus.. but it's ""normal"" according to my ENT (same dude that put my tubes in as a baby btw). He prescribed me oil ear drops. I recently had an appointment with a nurse practitioner and she told me the inside of my right ear has some flakes (my right ear is significantly worse than the left, I have to keep people on the left to hear them better), but my left ear had normal wax.

Im so confused and frustrated. Ive been told multiple times by doctors that things are normal when they arent. Im severely anemic from heavy periods that I was told were normal. I was told my dermatillomania was just from my anxiety disorder, and then another doctor actually listened to me and diagnosed me with OCD. Its a conundrum.

The tinnitus is your brain’s reaction to your ears not processing certain sounds. I have otosclerosis and tinnitus and that is what my audiologist shared with me. Hearing aids will help, so I’d recommend meeting with an audiologist to discuss options. Depending on your family’s health insurance or where you live, they can advise on the most affordable route. 

Ask your audiologist to help explain your hearing test results more too. That will help you better understand what is happening and how your hearing my change in the future. My hearing will continue to decline until I opt to have surgery. 

I’d also highly recommend reading the book, all in her head. It’s not about hearing loss, but it will provide context on why you feel that you need advocate for your experiences more.

Edit to add: I completely understand your frustrations too! I was the “what” member of my family until I got hearing aids.

Without seeing your audiogram, it's hard to meaningfully comment on your situation.

""Lost the ability to hear high notes"" is not specific enough to understand what's happening with your hearing.

Hi! I dont want to bother with a super long comment/questions so i will message you :)

Call and get a copy of your audiogram…. Alternatively, I have found AirPods plus an iPhone hearing test is remarkably close to my actual audiogram and is directionally correct enough to share with this thread.

Most tests don’t test beyond the areas of speech for high frequency. So, while it’s true we lose the high, high frequencies as we age (like 10k+), losing those in the 4-8k range means you will not hear speech correctly. If your loss is there, it’s not normal at 17(!) and you could use a hearing aid and some further testing.

1n9hofm,HearingLoss,SSNHL and pregnant,"Hi all,

Long story short I am 16 weeks pregnant and woke up with hearing loss in my right ear, ringing, and clogged. Diagnosed this morning with SSNHL. Given my pregnancy the doctor was willing to start with injections immediately while waiting for my OB to weigh in on the safety of the pills. The steroid pill course would be 60mg for 2 weeks and taper off.

Are there any success stories of people at least partially recovering with only injections? Am curious to hear how others have fared with injections.

If I am allowed to start pills, I wouldn't be able to take them until Monday AM. Is this too late or does the injection mean I've made it into the 72 hour window?

TIA.

Edit: my first injection was 15 hours after onset. Mild loss at 2000 Hz and above, essentially no loss below 2000 Hz. Will see if I can post the audiogram.

Try Bluetooth hearing protection. They are available in muffs or in “ear buds” that wrap around your neck. While mowing, it’s a good idea to protect your hearing to avoid more hearing loss.

All good. Promise.

It’s not an actual audiogram so isn’t reliable but your hearing in all frequencies is well above the boundary for normal and mild hearing loss.

No hearing loss on this screening, this is not a true hearing test

For the people saying this isn’t a real test, it looks like the Apple AirPod Pro hearing test and it’s a solid air conduction test. You can take these results seriously. 

True it’s not a diagnostic test and there is a lot of missing info to get the full picture of someone’s hearing, but the air conduction lines are the air conduction lines.

I'm just coming back from seeing an audiologist who completely ignored my concerns and said there's nothing to be done about my hearing. I really don't know what to do at this point since hearing aids would either be too much bother to acquire (both in terms of time and money) but the hearing loss I do have is still incredibly bothersome and seemingly permanent.

uhhh, if its in normal range you dont have hearing loss. you arent getting brushed off there is just no hearing loss so they are not going to treat you for hearing loss. you are also not supposed to be able to listen to more than one person at a time. im not trying to be rude but there is just nothing an audiologist could do for someone with normal hearing

If your hearing is within the normal range for every frequency then surely you don’t have hearing loss. Hearing aids wouldn’t do anything for you.

Forgive me, but you sound a little anxious. You may want to consider things like NSDR to calm your nervous system. I had profound hearing loss, but now it’s moderate to severe to contend with and have found working on my nervous system to help with both hyperacusis and tinnitus.

You might have hidden hearing loss where the synapses that transmit hearing signal from the stereocilia are damaged and this does not let all sound signal to reach the brain. This is called hidden hearing loss as there is no measurable change in thresholds on a standard audiogram as the stereocilia are likely intact. Loss of synaptic connections often can lead to problems understanding people in groups or with background noise. There are treatments that are currently in clinical trials that are working to restore the connection between the synapses and stereocilia. Cilcare is one of the companies that are working on this exact problem and are planning to start phase 2a clinical trials at the end of 2025 or beginning of 2026.

There are people in here who can’t even hear their own kids speaking to them and you’re here complaining about your normal hearing?

Hello, something similar happened to me, of listening to loud music and without giving it adequate rest I lost a certain degree of very slight hearing, which bothers me on a daily basis, with also hypersensitivity but it does not allow me to be in places with a lot of noise.
I also went to several ENT doctors and had several hearing tests, some of them told me that I had nothing and it is psychological, that I am within the normal hearing range. But others told me I had very mild acoustic trauma.
Have you had high frequency audiometry?
Sadly it is something that cannot be recovered, it is learning to deal with it and being more aware of our health and care.

You have normal hearing. Focus on something else.

Same issue, I’m 7 weeks in praying it gets better. I’m seeing a 15 decibel loss 2K-4K frequency on my right ear. my left ear is perfect 10db or lower across the board.

1n6av7k,HearingLoss,Hearing aids for low frequencies,"I had a systemic infection 4 months ago, which affected both of my ears. 

Initially (in both ears) I had mild low frequency hearing loss and severe high frequency loss. After recovery, my lows recovered but I still have mild to severe high frequency losses on an audiogram.

I have standard issues high frequency tinnitus - hiss/EEE etc - its constant and annoying.

BUT I also have an infuriating low frequency warbling tinnitus in my left ear. It is masked by environmental noise and speech, but instantly turns back 'on' when the stimulus stops. It is moderately loud. Therefore when I'm surrounded by just day to day noise, my tinnitus is constantly off/on/off/on. It is infuriatingly intrusive and depressing.

Can a hearing aid help with this at all? I suspect only a few particular low frequencies are affected around 150-200hz (not detectable on a standard audiogram). If I boosted the low frequencies with a HA in this ear, would this maybe help? I 'm struggling to function with this, and I don't see how my brain can habituate to this sort of tinnitus.

[댓글]
A hearing aid can help by providing more balanced sound input to your brain. This will reduce the contrast between silence and noise, which can make tinnitus less noticeable. 

Heardirectclub Nova hearing aids are worth considering, since they provide gentle amplification that can help mask tinnitus without overwhelming your hearing.

In my experience the HA with the best and fullest low end is Widex, but even then it’s still only reproducing down to about 300 or 250. It just gives a lot more energy to that range whereas other brands focus a lot on 1k-4k.

Well your hearing aid will help you with your tinnitus while wearing them but unfortunately most of the hearing aids are not designed for this type of hearing loss. I'm an audio engineer. I have low frequency hearing loss in my right ear. I'm in the same boat as you. For the best results you need a custom mold for your ear, but this will lead to an occlusion effect. The ideal is to let some of the natural sound (frequencies) your ear still is able to hear to reach your eardrum. But bass (long wavelength) has the tendency to ""escape"" in such situations. Did you noticed how audiograms are measuring from 125hz to 8khz? Is because most of the human speech is in this range. Meanwhile normal hearing is between 20hz to 20khz. Yet no hearing aid manufacturer is focusing on those ranges and audiologists don't measure them. Is a hard situation.

First glance, no, you don't need hearing aids. I wouldn't even call this truly ""borderline"".

Go to a ENT or a real audiologist who doesn't get a commission and see what they say. I would not consider this borderline at all. Some degree of difficulty of hearing in noise is just normal or processing limitations of your brain. I don't know a human alive that can hear conversation with a bunch of kids yelling lol.

Can we swap? Seriously

i would personally not recommend hearing aids at all. they dont typically make hearing in noise easier, but harder usually:(

At one point we are going to need a law that mandates the separation of eye exam and the sale of aids. In California, we have something like that for eye exams (and the reason LensCrafters does not employ optometrists in California).  What you describe is definitely a case of conflict of interest .

1n5usd4,HearingLoss,Tips for learning languages with hearing loss + ADHD?,"Hey, I could really use some advice. I’ve got about **55 dB hearing loss** (I wear hearing aids, but honestly they don’t help that much with language learning) and ADHD. That combo makes studying super frustrating. The usual advice I hear is *“immersion, just listen a lot, podcasts, movies, etc.” -* but that doesn’t really work for me. Even after months, I often don’t recognize words I’ve studied, because in real speech people blur/change the sounds. It feels like I’d have to rehear every single word in isolation, which is exhausting. I run about an hour every day and thought podcasts would be perfect for that time, but I just can’t catch the words clearly enough to learn from them. Has anyone here (with hearing loss, ADHD, or both) found strategies that actually *work* for language learning? I’m open to any tips that aren’t the same old “immersion only” stuff. r/ADHD r/HearingLoss r/HearingAids r/languagelearning

I have been wanting to ask this forever. I have been studying French off and on for over 40 years. since high school. I am probably 70% deaf.  I've given up on my learning as it's so hard to catch the nuances of the pronunciation.

1n5qp51,HearingLoss,Pain and zaps after SSHL,"Hello. On 7 march 2025 I had a sudden hearing loss in the left ear. Mainly in the bass frequencies but also up to 1 kHz! The losses are around 60dB at 500Hz 55dB at 250 etc… Since then I’m scheduled to a MRI that never comes! Yeah they move slow and I can’t afford to pay it! I have some other problems though. I noticed a slight pain like stabbing in my ear drum. They said is no infection in there. Today I was to my ENT and she said is clear! Yet I feel a slight pain and discomfort! Also behind my ear like behind my ear lobe right in that dip (hole) of the ear! Is not a huge pain but it is! Also from time to time I feel like zaps! Short moments when the tinitus is getting louder and I feel like a zap from a laser or electric current through my inner ear! I’m so scared! What the hell is that? Is a tumor? Did anyone with SSHL experienced the same?

I have zaps when I move my head in certain ways. This happened after SSNHL, but no pain, just tinnitus.

I had a head injury which (presumably) damaged either my cochlea, or the nerves running to the brain.

Ever since I have had bad tinnitus with periodic *pops* and *pings* which I can only compare to the sensation of the pins and needles of an asleep leg waking up -- but painless.  It's only the intensity of the sensation that makes me think it *should* be painful.

Sensorineural hearing loss is, in blunt terms, a kind of nerve damage.  And so phantom and illusory sensations are often associated with it.

If you're having actual pain at your ear drum, and where you are describing underneath your earlobe, pain that is sensitive to you pressing on the outside, some kind of ear infection in the middle ear, is actually pretty likely.  But I'm not a doctor.  I would follow up if it continues.

I also had SSHL on March 7, 2025, in my left ear. Since then, I experience zaps when I move my head quickly to the right or upward. The noise I hear when moving my head is brief, and it overrides the tinnitus. I don’t feel any pain. My MRI came back clear.",2025-09-01 14:48:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1n5qp51/pain_and_zaps_after_sshl/
1n5deag,HearingLoss,Fluctuating Hearing?,"Posting here because I don't know where else to turn. I had ISSHL in my right ear in summer of 2022 and ISSHL in my left ear July of this year. My questions are:

\- I was told it's rare to experience ISSHL twice, in both ears at different times like me. How true is this? Does anyone else have experience with getting diagnoses with ISSHL twice?

\- My hearing abilities in my left ear fluctuate, while my right ear has remained relatively consistent. I've done three hearing tests in the two months since getting diagnosed with ISSHL in my left ear: once the first time seeing my ENT, then two weeks later after 10 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), and another two weeks later after concluding my 20th session of HBOT. My 2nd test showed improvement over the first, but my 3rd test reverted back to the results of my 1st test. Most days I can hear at a 7/10 in my left ear, hardly requiring me to use my hearing aid. However, there are select days (maybe 1-3 random days in a 2-week period) in which my ability to hear in my left ear drops to a 2 or 3/10. It feels stuffy with loud tinnitus, brought on at random. Sometimes I wake up into this experience and it improves over the day, but today I went the whole day with high hearing ability until it dropped at about 5pm.

  
Does anyone experience either of these experiences I have? Any help or even commiserating would be appreciated as it feels isolating to not even have my ENT or GP being able to help me. TIA

1n56w5j,HearingLoss,My daughter's test results,"Wondering any anyone can tell me what kind of hearing loss If it's still considered SNHL or now slopping SNHL?

A bit of a back story 

My daughter was born and failed 2 of her newborn healing losses. Doctors tried a few different tests abs she would not tolerate them very well so they tried an sedated ABR. That took another few months because we kept getting sent to the wrong place cause no one was communicating with each other 🤦‍♀️ and it wax 2 and a half hours away. They finally diagnosed her with high frequency hearing loss right. Normal in the left. Sensinoral in nature. 

Fast forward to when she was 2 she got tubes to try to drain fluid behind her ear and her speech exploded! They fell out after about a year or two

This year in July she got another set. The right is already working its way out. And she had another hearing test. We are talking about getting hearing aids for her

At the time I couldn't go to the ENT because he was booked up and I honestly just didn't have the money. My hearing didn't change right away, it started out feeling like fluid in one ear that stayed a bit muffled, especially after waking in the mornings. Then it got progressly worse, by the time I saw the ENT, I needed tubes. He put in the tubes May 8th, my hearing got better over a 2 week span, then hit a plateau. Went back, did a hearing test, its conductive, this the CT.

The ENT I saw today was a different doc for 2nd opinion. He feels i should get off serc and just take dyazide and flavonoid.

Symptoms:

My left T had almost resolved after wax removal (Aug 5) but somehow is back now since a few days. I feel it could be stress related. 

My right T is almost always constant, barely had 2-3 days when i felt it was almost gone. Rest of the time i feel it’s either same or escalated. The ear pressure mostly resolved around July 22nd but is back since a few days. Again, i feel it is stress related.

So I went to an appointment today and handed the doctor a sheet I used AI to write about all my concerns and that I had pictures, I want micro-suction my symptoms etc. The doctor got angry said he’s insulted and he won’t do what I asked. He wouldn’t address my concerns and played dumb about why he would look at pictures of my ears that I brought. He only wanted to talk about other doctors I should go see none  of whom will work. This is the 3rd ENT to either yell at me like I’m a Karen or walk out on me completely after requesting micro section cleaning. No one else will work. One ENT only cleans a part of my ears at a time when I need the entire ear cleaned like up to the opening. I’m so done dealing with this. No one does this type of surgery anymore. I’m so in deep doo doo ears will get injured by accumulation. 

[댓글]
What do you mean post surgery ears?

Do you have a previous ENT? Can you go back to this ENT or the Doctor who did your surgery?  Did you bring your medical records to these new ENTs that explained your condition and what is required in the future?

Doctors hate it as much as everyone else if someone struts in and explains to them how to do their job.

And to add insult to injury, with something that was written by AI aka a digital word processor ( which is by now fairly recognizable to everyone who has seen a few AI texts)

Micro-suction cleaning is an absolute standard procedure thats done pretty much before anything as a routine at the ENT, and any ENT will do it pretty much reflexively if he looks into your ears and sees them clogged up. 

I understand your concerns, but have you tried simply going to an ENT, letting them have a look at your ears and draw their own conclusions? Frankly, if I was in the ENTs shoes I'd get pretty angry as well, they way you are going about it is guaranteeing to antagonize anyone. Because you act from the start as if the doctor didn't know  the basics of their own profession.",2025-08-28 18:56:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1n2kxi6/really_bad_ent_experience/

Homeopathy is fucking nonsense. Move along.

Not all homoeopaths are actively charlatans. Some are kind people who genuinely want to help others but lack the skills to do so. They end up convincing themselves that there's a conspiracy against their wonder-medication rather than face the grim reality that they don't have what it takes to fulfil their ambitions.

They don't work. All homeopathic remedies are scams, without an exception.

Hi! As it says, you now have severe to profound hearing loss. OAE is a test that measures the health of cochlear hairs (how we hear). DPOAE is essentially a type of that and they are either present (healthy), reduced, (damaged), or absent (severely damaged) from my understanding. Typically OAE disappear around 50db or less and i think DPOAE are more sensitive. At one frequency (your best one) you had a present OAE, but the rest are absent which id typical for your hearing loss :)

there is also something called acoustic reflexes that i am not 100% sure how it works but absent reflexes are typical for your hearing loss as well. 

the other measures are simply that your ear canal is clear of anything blocking your ear drum and your ear drum moves as expected",2025-08-27 05:28:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1n18mhb/can_some_help_me_interpret_the_audiological/

Aswell I have small ear canals so they block easily. I want to listen to music and use headphones but I can unless I damage my ears which is irreversible. Im just very upset because I love music so much and of course hearing is so important in daily life. I must say anyone with severe/ total hearing loss has it so much worse and I respect you so much for it. 

[댓글]
Sorry OP, you’re not alone. I did the same growing up and was not aware of the dangers of loud music and the permanence of hearing damage. Everyone around us grew up listening to loud music and going to concerts without earplugs so we wouldn’t have known. Some people are fine, but we got unlucky. Protect your hearing from now on and try not to be so hard on yourself.

you didn't know back then you just do what you love(listening to music) what you can do now is protect the hearing that you have. what if you just listen to music without using headphone

I'm curious as to how much education you got on hearing damage when you were younger - i.e. what causes it. I didn't get any (that I remember).

As a society, we need to do better at educating people on hearing loss. Leveraging channels like NBC's *The More You Know* would help.

Get hearing aids.  Good ones.  Proper hearing aids programmed by the audiologist so they never go loud enough to further damage your hearing.  Then listen to your music all you want.  Music sounds great through mine with the music program.  The best listening experience really, much better than headphones.  Though not quite like the ears I had when I was younger.  That extra sparkle is gone forever, I'm afraid.

This may help you.
Openrun headphones by shockz.

I have hearing damage from wearing inner AirPods, so I now use silicon earplugs when travelling, and at the gym. 
I use the Shockz bone conducting headphones for music and calls.

As a cyclist I initially used shockz so that I could ride my bike and hear traffic.
With the hearing damage and tinnitus, I now use the bone conducting headphones to listen to music by vibration.
In the gym, the silicon earplugs plugs block out the gym ambient music and enhance the music from the shockz, by isolating the ear canal.

may I know what is your current age right now?

Use bone conduction headphones; they can help if you have small ear canals.  
As for the hearing loss, if it’s mild, I don’t think it’s too serious. I’ve heard several cases from musicians, and I can tell you that the ear can endure quite a lot, even at around 90 dB, which is common. If you used to listen to music at full volume, I recommend taking better care of your ears from now on.

I could give you more advice, but that might be overthinking it. At the very least, I’d suggest considering having your wisdom teeth removed, since poor dental occlusion can cause other problems.

In my case, bone conduction headphones have helped me. I have significant hearing loss due to inflammation near the auditory nerve. This happened because of poor occlusion caused by a wisdom tooth. The inflammation also spread to a lymph node near my ear, worsened by reflux.

In short, several factors contributed to my hearing loss, but it can be improved if you take your overall health into account.

In hindsight, I'm not sure if I damaged my hearing listening to loud music in my teens/20's, or if my damaged hearing made me listen to music loudly.   My Mom always used ask me why I didn't answer the phone since I was closest to it.   (1970's)  When I enlisted in the U.S. Navy, the physical exam guy marked that I had good hearing, even though I flunked the hearing test (Age 18).   Second year in the Navy, they prescribed me hearing aids, and removed me from flying/spying due to having ""poor accuracy"" of my audio intercepts.   My poor hearing could have been my fault, or maybe not.  But it got me free College, Apartment, Car courtesy of Department of Defense, (and disability benefits to this day), so I'm not too upset over it all.  GOD's WILL.

Do not use headsets, and play music not so loud. I had the same issue, i own thousands of records, went to techno discotheques for over 30 years, concerts of all sorts, ... Lost most hearing on my left one, the right one is miraculously perfect. I think I needed volumen like a drug, to escape from bullying, boring schools and college, even more boring Jobs, etc. Be super careful.

I had this issue and thought it was completely fault of my own, however when I told my doctors (GP, audiologists, ent) that I listened to music loudly for such extensive periods of time none of them cared whatsoever about that fact, and I found out later through tests that it wasn't my fault and I actually have conductive hearing loss.

This isn't to say that you too have this, and that your music isn't the issue, but sometimes the music isn't the issue and it's a deeper problem. Regardless don't be too hard on yourself, music lovers have done this to themselves for generations. There isn't much public education on the topic either.

I am sorry about having to go through this.  Myself I am in a similar situation but more severe.  Moderately severe was my hearing loss . It's from work and using tools.   Over the years I have used hearing protection . However looking back ,I could have been way  more diligent with hearing protection.

The reality it should have , could have would have !we can't go back and change our habits .  We have to realize it is what it is ! Male a plan to deal with our hearing loss ! As well a plan to help prevent what hearing we have left ! At that point we need to abide by the plan. 

I understand pointing blame , however having a blame mindset will eat you up inside ! O do get it though .

[removed]

I feel your pain. I’m going to get a referral for an audiologist because my hearing is starting to affect my job and relationship. I was always the type to listen to music at really high volumes to drown out the world around me or when my mom and I would fight.

They're mostly the same. You have unilateral  low frequency hearing loss. If you have fluctuations in your hearing, get checked for cochlear hydrops.

I’ve experienced tts after a concert before but it’s always lasted only a couple hours. A few days ago I shot clay pigeons at a family get together for a few hours. No hearing protection because I’ve never had problems before (I know it’s a bad habit and it’ll catch up like it has today) and my left ear went “numb” it felt full, muffled, and was ringing quite bad. It has now been 62 hours since the incident. The hearing I had lost has returned back about 95% the fullness and numbness is gone. There is still a slight muffling and when I’m total silence my ear still rings faintly like i just took my headphones off after listening to loud music for over an hour. 

Is it tts or nihl and do you guys think I should go to a doctor or give it a couple more days

1n06ryy,HearingLoss,Living with hole in eardrum?,"I’m 23. I’ve had 2 failed tympanoplasty procedures on my right ear before age 8 because of drainage tubes as a toddler. My ENT claimed everything was fixed after the second one, but told me to always wear ear plugs “just in case” so I did. I went to an audiologist today for the first time in years (I don’t have health insurance) hoping that she would tell me my ear drum was healed and I no longer needed earplugs…. but she found a gigantic hole instead. So I’m back at square one. Apparently, I also have moderate conductive hearing loss in that ear, but I’ve been living with it for years so it doesn’t bother me. My other ear is fine, so I guess it’s doing all the work.

I’m really paranoid about getting a middle ear infection now, because I love to swim. Although, I guess I’ve been living like this for a while. The audiologist really freaked me out. She told me I need to use wax and a cap over my ear every time I shower (something I have never done). 

Is it worth it to get another surgery? How many of these surgeries can you have?? The back of my ear already looks like Frankenstein.

I’m kind of freaking out. Can anyone give me advice? I would love to hear from someone who has also been living with a perforated eardrum.

I had near total missing ear drum for 5 years. You need to get it fixed. You need an neurotologist / otologist surgeon surgeon who only does ears to fix it. 
It can get worse and cause pain ringing headaches. 
Take care of it. 
My hearing improved after I got it fixed. 

Imagine washing your hair without ear plugs!! 

The surgery has improved a lot. 3 times the charm

1mzrhr0,HearingLoss,I can't embrace my deafness.,"I'm F31, and I know I'm not taking things the way I should but my personality has always been like this. Since I got diagnosed with permanent hearing loss due to ""ear infections "" a day won't pass without me feeling less than other deaf people, and really dumb and stupid about my mistakes and myself. I didn't told my audiologist that previous to my diagnosis I left my ears without flushing them properly for almost 10 years,  in my early 20's I had moments of deafness and once my brother suggested me to clean them more profoundly since maybe I had a build up, I worked back then but didn't prioritized my ear health because my mother told me that cleaning my ears would be too pricey for me so I proscrastinated a lot with that, not knowing that the price wouldn't be so high after all but I did it too late, the past year when I was already permanently deaf in both ears . I tried the old at home methods for years hoping that they would cure me but it didn't happened,  no peroxide, or earwax drops helped. I know is too late and pointless but I can't find inner peace after not treating my ears properly, I'm venting this because I know I need therapy but can't go now because of financial issues, but if anyone here has any tools to help me to deal better with my situation I will be forever thankful about it. 

[댓글]
I think about or notice my own hearing loss every day. All I can say is I have to be thankful that it's not worse and at least in part my younger self did this to my older self. 

The infections were in your outer ear? Like where the wax is? That doesn't usually cause permanent damage. Inner ear infection can't be fixed by flushing.

I think you're beating yourself up way too much. Some people are prone to infections. Cleaning your ears won't stop middle ear infections, and outer ear infections would have to go on untreated for months before you would get hearing loss.

Your not alone in this. 

I was around 15 when my ear became badly infected, I then had recurring issues right up until I was in my late 30s but was too anxious and embarrassed go get it looked at. The longer I left it, the more I couldn't face the problem. 

Then last year I got the courage up. Was diagnosed with cholesteatoma, had surgery and am currently waiting on a hearing aid for the profound deafness ive been left with.

me either.. what can we do ? I use psychiatry treatment but is no better. I'm less suicidal though. I'm uspet because I can't afford the hearing aids. They cost like 4000 euro for both ears. I was planning to sell a kidney or something but I can't because when I was younger I had hepatitis c. Because of that I can't donate blood or other organs. :( Is so hard. Once I went to an audiologist and proved some nice hearing aids... maaaan was another world. Do you have some hearing left? Any audiogram to share with us mare mortals? If you are under 90dB you are a candidate for cochlear implants. They will cost you an arm and a leg and an eye and a nostril for each ear but at least you will hear. If you have some hearing left, hearing aids are decent, really. Yes is your fault you didn't pay attention to your ears. See? I did my mistake also like blasting music through earphones. Never had problems with earwax though because I used to wash them with a rubber pear.

Yeah blasting music is not a myth! But the candles are! Those people blasting music will have some hearing problems at one point! It happens suddenly! In my case happened at 44 years of age. The damage to the inner ear is cumulative. A little bit from there another bit from there and at one point you are deaf! The inner ear has some cells with little hairs that vibrate with sound. They are suspended in a liquid! They are very sensitive to sound pressure, viruses, all kind of things that can destroy them! Fish and birds do regenerate the hairy cells in the inner ear! The mammals don’t!

1mzquva,HearingLoss,Suggestions on hearing aids to buy for moderate hearing loss,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with moderate hearing loss and I’m finally ready to invest in HAs but I’m honestly not sure where to start. There are so many options out there (otc, prescription, online, audiologist) and I don’t know where to start.

I’d really appreciate any recommendations from people who’ve found something that works well for moderate loss. Good sound clarity and comfort are important to me, and I’d love something that isn’t super complicated to use.



If it helps, I’m open to either affordable options or higher end ones, as long as they actually work. Any insight or personal experience would mean a lot!



[댓글]
From what I tested my eyes are on ReSound Savi. The have the same tech as the last year top of the range hearing aids. They have up to 12 channels so more than enough for customization. As somebody already said: forget the OTC, OTC is for idiots. For people who want to be robbed. You need professional stuff. Also don't get rechargeable aids, get the classic ones with zinc batteries as 312. Usually when a hearing aid is getting defective is the Li-Ion battery. You cannot replace it, is packaged with the mainboard. So you need to buy another one. Google up ReSound Savi. Also has Bluetooth LE. Is very important when you buy such tech to have Bluetooth LE, believe me.

First, get a hearing test ( you don't say who diagnosed you or how). If there's a Costco near you, that's a great place to start. Forget OTCs. If there's a university audiology clinic, that would be another good place to go. You don't need to shop for brands and model; that's what the audiologist or technician is fir, to recommend what you need based on your pattern of loss. The key is finding a professional work with who will listen to you. HAs aren't ""put them on and go"" like glasses. You'll need a couple sessions for adjustments, after you've worn them for a week or 2. It's a dance where your brain adjusts to the HAs - then you tweak, maybe several times.

I've got moderate loss in both ears and I started with OTCs just to see if they'd make a difference. Picked up an affordable pair from audien (\~$600) and they've been surprisingly decent for the basics. They're pretty straightforward to use but they have bluetooth (which I like) so I can take calls and stream podcasts while working. If you want something with more customization, you should go to an audiologist.",2025-08-25 13:43:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mzquva/suggestions_on_hearing_aids_to_buy_for_moderate/

1mz9sc2,HearingLoss,"Had SNHL on my right, now I have SSNHL on my left.","Hi, I've been trying to play it cool but it isn't really helping me really.

When I was about 15, I had a Deviated Nasal Septum surgery and within an year I started feeling a loss of sound in my right ear. I told my boarding school doctor about it, he said it's due to ""cold"" and the ear gets blocked, no biggie yada yada. Then about every year I would tell my parents and they took it lightly, too lightly. Blamed headphones. 

Last to last year (I am 26 now) I got it checked myself, turns out I had SNHL in my right ear which is incurable at the point. The only hope is a Cochlear Implant Surgery &amp; that is damn costly. Most health insurances won't cover it because it's ""cosmetic"". Then my parents took it seriously though luckily for me, my left ear was completely fine. He did suggest me to use a hearing aid on my left ear so that all the pressure of using just one ear doesn't cause major damage but like a moron I didn't use it other than when absolutely necessary, like work meetings, group hangouts.

Exactly 5 days ago, I felt a massive, sudden drop in my left ear. Fell asleep, woke up and boom I couldn't hear clearly even yelled at. I could catch the faint sound, but not decipher the speech., I've had constant tinnitus since then. Rushed to my doctor, turns out it's SSNHL. Using hearing aids on both my ears, religiously this time. My ENT Surgeon started me on Steroids, said that his main focus is to save my left ear since the right might be too far gone as it was left untreated for 10 years. 

I was/am a heavy smoker and have gone cold turkey since. The tinnitus hasn't stopped even for a day. I am scared. I am functionally deaf without wearing the hearing aids. 

Smoking, negligence. I have done this to myself. I feel like this is the end. Funny enough, the SSNHL episode on my left ear happened on my very birthday. 

Sorry for the rant though.

Stories like this make me feel lucky I have one ear left. I woke up six days ago with essentially the same thing you’re dealing with in my right ear.

There is no science that it works, but there have been success stories. I feel like 10% of hearing came back this week. I’m told 6 to 8 weeks and see where you are then.

1mz7e2i,HearingLoss,Second Opinion?,"Kind of a strange post, but something on my mind lately.  
  
**About me:**

I developed my hearing loss randomly in high school about 12 years ago. Went through the standard sequence of tests to see what was going on, but nothing.

I have pretty profound hearing loss (especially in the high frequencies) and have been wearing hearing aids since my first diagnosis (about 12 years).  

Moreover, I got genetic test results back \~1 month ago to see if something in my genetics caused it-- still no known cause though.

No loud noises, no known infection, and no family history of hearing loss.

Currently, I wear hearing aids, but I realize my hearing is continuously getting worse, and even with hearing aids, I can't really hear people in a loud environment.  It is even difficult to hear dialogue inside Movie Theaters.

**Question:**

Is it worth seeing an ENT for a second opinion at this point? Strangely, no tests can explain why I have hearing loss, and I have no known genetic link either. Moreover, it has been \~12 years since my first batch of tests.  It is worth noting that I generally see an ENT once a year for a hearing test but nothing more substansive.

I was diagnosed at 18, now in my 40s and still don't have a cause for my HL. If you can afford it, then why not investigate some more? I was told that for many, the cause of hearing loss remains unknown and I have made peace with this. But I was also told that there is still so little we know about genes and deafness and, of course, if the opportunity arises for further testing (not just genetic), I will certainly be on board.

I had sudden onset hearing loss in my right ear at 7. Was given 2 different hearing aids as a child which were no benefit given the severity of hearing loss and lack of speech recognition. I was never offered an alternative. And No one knows why I lost my hearing. I decided to go back to ENT last year (now 29 years old). My audiologist said hearing aids will not benefit me at our first meeting. She offered CROS, BAHA and CI. I opted for CI and was just activated last week. They do not know the level of benefit I will get from it since my nerve has been without stimulation for so many years but so far I am happy I got a second option and happy with my choice of CI!",2025-08-24 21:01:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mz7e2i/second_opinion/
1mz2th0,HearingLoss,Low frequency hearing loss in right ear,"I’ve had tinnitus for as long as I can remember. When I was around 10 or 11, I used to hear these weird ringing sounds, especially at night, and it made falling asleep really hard. I used to hate winter because there weren’t any background sounds like a fan to cover up the noise.

Back then, though, I didn’t have any hearing loss — at least not until 2020, when I was around 15–16. I’ve always had issues whenever I caught a cold or had a runny nose; my ears would get affected, probably because of fluid buildup, and my hearing would get muffled. But it always used to come back on its own… until one day, it didn’t.

I went to the doctor, had a hearing test, and found out I have low-frequency hearing loss in my right ear. My left ear is fine, but I have tinnitus in both. I honestly have no idea if my hearing has gotten worse since then, but the uncertainty eats at me.

The hardest part is that I produce music — something I’ve loved for as long as I can remember. Missing out on low frequencies in my right ear isn’t easy, but I’m trying to adapt. Still, there are times when I spiral and think… what if one day I go completely deaf? What happens then? Everything I love would just… end.

Hello brother in suffering and misery. Pretty much same story in here. Always had good hearing though. I worked in music production, programmed synths, arrangements, shits like this, I invested some money in home monitors things like that. One day my left ear lost some bass frequencies. Wrong diagnosis of course, but with some basic luck it want back. Then on 7 March 2025 booom! My right ear went down. I thought is wax or something. On the other hand I knew it may be worse so the second day I bought steroids and Started the ""attack"". I was scheduled to an ENT but after 2 weeks. So imagine that! :)))) If they don't fix you in 24-48H you for nothing. In few days my hearing responded to the medicine but all the sudden dropped again. Another round of steroids and so on. I did this come and go like 4-5 time till 25 June 2025 till I call it a day because it was dangerous (they have tons of side effects like losing calcium from bones, losing women, all kind of nasty things). As I said I had losses mainly in 125hz, 250hz, 500 hz (worst) and 1 Khz. The others were acceptable. One day I was @ work and I felt like my right shitty ear is going even worse!

1mywnqu,HearingLoss,Just diagnosed with SSNHL,"Idiopathic, woke up early August with moderate loss in left ear, tinnitus, dizziness. Thought it was illness or allergies. 

No improvement, went to doctor later that week, she thought fluid in ear, put me on allergy medicine and 20mg prednisone for a week, still no improvement, ENT referral.

ENT immediately suspected SSNHL, upped prednisone and I have had 2 of 3 injections (3rd is tomorrow) and the audiogram. MRI ordered but not yet obtained. 4 more days of the oral prednisone which is horrible. (I was just at the two week mark of onset, he said this was the outside mark for treatment?)

I don’t notice any marked hearing improvement and to my ENTs surprise I still have some dizziness/I get wobbly walking (best I can describe it is feeling “buzzed”). 

I don’t know what to  expect, I really don’t know how to deal with this constant tipsy feeling, I can’t listen to books or music as much as I used to. While my loss isn’t as great as some (the audiologist said I had a lot to work with), has anyone else had the dizziness remain? 

What should I expect? ENT mentioned hearing aids but that it would be after a second hearing exam (late sept) and follow up (late oct) which seem so far away 😭

Hi,

Below, you can find the positive (good) prognostic predictors/indicators of SSNHL. The opposite would be bad for outcomes. 

Earlier treatment start (ideally ≤3 days; benefit declines after 2 weeks).  ￼ ￼ ￼

Milder initial loss

Audiogram shape: ascending / low-frequency loss (better than descending/high-frequency; flat is mixed but generally worse than ascending).  ￼ ￼ ￼

No vertigo (absence of vestibular symptoms such as dizziness

Younger age.  ￼ ￼

Early partial improvement (notably within 10 days) 

Tinnitus or aural fullness at onset (often, but not always, linked with better outcomes, likely reflecting residual cochlear function)

Unilateral hearing loss (compared to bilateral)

The hearing loss in the most problematic ear has loss all the way across not just low tones. Yes I agree that if loss in both ears it might not be Ssnhl. But if flat loss across in one ear indicates ssnhl.

I am a Doctor and had this idiopathic SSNHL. Started HBOT in a week that helped a lot. Highly recommend oxygen for you.

This is exactly how it started for me. It was super random! I started steroids and injections not even 24 hours after onset. It went from a total loss to about a 40% loss and now I wear a hearing aid which kinda sorta helps. I had really bad anxiety about it but it’s been 3 years now and I don’t notice the tinnitus unless I think about it and it’s been awhile since I had vertigo. I promise you you’ll be fine :)

i dont know a ton about sudden loss so this is my unprofessional suggestion, but asymmetrical bilateral sudden hearing loss is not typical. usually it is unilateral or i have even seen the same loss in both ears. if i were in your position, i would get a second opinion. that way they could either agree with the original provider or rule out other things (such as AIED or menieres). dizziness and vertigo i THINK are common with sudden loss but id personally as for balance testing and ruling out other issues

Not sure about SSNHL here due to the fact that you seemingly have a loss in your better ear at 250 and some loss further along aswell. Also lingering dizziness isn’t a good sign. I’d suspect menieres here and you need to address that urgently to avoid further loss in either ear.",2025-08-24 14:13:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mywnqu/just_diagnosed_with_ssnhl/

In the last week, I’ve started using earbuds. My headphones are fine, but the audio quality of my earbuds is so much clearer. What I’ve noticed in the last few days is that my hearing seems to not be as keen even with my hearing aid in. Is it possible the minimal earbud usage has had an affect?

Anything and everything is possible. You need to see an objective info to decide and act accordingly. I'd advise an urgent audiogram. Also, there's an app on android called hearing test (a green icon).

1myc3ji,HearingLoss,Help Please!!!!!,"I have been using ITC hearing aids for a few years, but now I need to upgrade to RIC because of my hearing loss. I’m struggling to understand how to choose the right company and model. Every audiologist I meet suggests a different brand, each claiming theirs is the best while saying the others are just okay, and then leaving the decision to me.

This is a really big decision for me—financially, emotionally, and mentally—and I’m getting more confused every day. The main options seem to be Phonak (Lumity or Infinio), Widex (Moment or SmartRIC), Signia (Styletto), or ReSound (Nexia).

I don’t know how to decide. Some people recommend Widex, some suggest Signia, others say Phonak is better. I heard Signia has complaints, Phonak is supposedly better than Widex, and I was leaning towards Phonak Infinio or Sphere Infinio, but then someone told me Infinio has issues and advised Lumity instead. Another person strongly recommends ReSound Nexia, saying it’s far better due to the extra mic in the receiver, which improves sound and clarity.

I honestly don’t know how to assess this or what to do. I feel very depressed because of the uncertainty. Could you please help me understand how to choose the right company and model?

What brand are your current hearing? Your experience with hearing aids will kind of sway how you feel about different companies. For example, if you’ve been driving a Chevy car for 20 years and suddenly switch to Ford, it might feel a little strange to you. 

If you are in the US, you may get a few weeks or months to try them out. Choose the one that has the features you want (Bluetooth, size/portability of the charger, style, etc). If you don’t like it, hopefully you have a trial period to change your mind. 

Since you’re choosing a RIC, you may be able to try them out in the office to get a feel for them. Ask the audiologist if you can listen to demo hearing aids for the ones you are considering.

The audiologist and some hearing aids companies will allow you trial them. I suggest pick the top 3, and take them for a spin. Then decide which works best  for you.",2025-08-23 20:27:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1myc3ji/help_please/
1my8qqw,HearingLoss,question about mild/moderate loss,"hi! this is purely out of curiosity 

i have severe hearing loss and i feel like my hearing aids do absolutely nothing for me. 

how do people with less of a loss feel about hearing aids? do they help you understand speech? in noise? 

im just really curious because some folks say hearing aids are life changing for them and that has just not been my experience. im wondering if the level of hearing loss os correlated 

[댓글]
I have mild to moderate hearing loss right now (it's progressive). Hearing aids really don't seem to help in hearing people talking with background noise. The things they seem to help most with are random noises like cars approaching when walking, animals or bugs like cicadas, and hearing the washing machine. They dont even seem to help that much with hearing the TV. Maybe I need to go back and have them reprogrammed again or maybe I'm losing more hearing, but they aren't as life changing as I'd hoped.

I have mild moderate hearing loss that is conductive. Bone conduction hearing aids are life changing. As a kid I had more severe hearing loss and traditional in ear hearing aids did nothing for me. I’m amped up about bone conduction hearing aids because they bypass my crappy ear canals and ear drums and deliver sounds to my auditory nerve which is normal (I think). I have wear this BAHA now around the outside of my head it’s super annoying but I can hear out my right ear which is very small. 
Do you use ASL?

May you please share your audiogram with us?

well I don't own hearing aid yet, but when I tried some I noticed a huge improvment in my hearing and speech understanding. I noticed another thing also. the entry, middle priced ones where so so. in high noise the voice was terrible. however with the most expensive ones, the voice was more focused. the ones that I would buy are either the ReSound Vivia (the top of the range) or the Phonak Audeo Infinio Sphere L90.

1mxxg91,HearingLoss,ALL sudden hearing losses are medical emergencies,"Hello, MD with cochlear hydrops here. 

Over the years, I've been seeing a lot of people with different hearing losses, trying to postpone seeing a doctor, or worse, random people advising others to ""wait it out"" because it might be TTS. 

This is a reminder to everyone out there, ALL SUDDEN HEARING LOSSES ARE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. 

One of the negative prognostic factors is delayed treatment. Go to your nearest emergency room / doctor's office and demand treatment, even before getting referred to an ENT. 

Best wishes to all.

💯 

I wish I knew this 17 years ago when I had my first major sudden hearing loss event. I obviously learned, eventually, and I preach this all the time.

Wish I knew this 2 months ago 
Went to 2 different primary care DOCTORS both said fluid in your ear from allergies it will clear up . Lost hearing in right ear totally defeated and actually angry

I've been telling anyone who will listen since my loss two weeks ago. I waited 5 days before starting prednisone and will forever kick myself if I don't get anything back.

This is 100% true!!

when it happened to me last year i had no idea and went to 2 different walk in clinics where they told me it was compacted ear wax...which i did have (get your ears cleaned people). neither of the clinics could clean my ears so they both suggested mineral oil in the ear to let the wax soften and fall out. did that for a few days with no improvement so i went to a proper hearing clinic where got my ears cleaned and was diagnosed with profound SSHL and told to go to the ER immediately. a few days after that i started injections and got back just enough hearing and word recognition to use a hearing aid.

if i knew what i know now i would have ran my ass to the ER the night that i noticed it.

I tell this to anyone who will listen when the subject comes up. Like many others, I didn't know it when I had my first one 24 years ago. I was on a cruise when it happened, so I couldn't get to a doctor immediately anyway, but even when I got back and called an ENT, their first opening was a couple of weeks later, and I didn't know enough at the time to push back, go to an ER, or keep looking for a doctor that could get me in sooner. That loss (severe, in my left ear) ended up being permanent.

I wonder if you would have an opinion on why doctors don't know this, especially an ENT or someone in emergency medicine?  

I have gone through sudden hearing loss twice before, once on the right (7+ years ago) and then on the left (almost 6 years ago). Both times I was seen in my ENT clinic within 24 hours. I was treated with oral steroids immediately, and started steroid injections within the first 1-2 weeks. I recovered substantial hearing both times and was pretty stable in my hearing except for fluctuating tinnitus and diminished hearing during illness. I admit I'm a little freaked out whenever I feel like my hearing is dampened or I have severe ear pain. 

So, five days ago, I suddenly lost hearing in my right ear again. It started in the morning sounding muffled and I felt a little congested, but no other symptoms. My ENT had advised me to come to his clinic for an audiogram and evaluation when I feel like my hearing is diminished rather that go to urgent care or elsewhere, so I called the clinic, and they scheduled me for a visit two weeks out. I assumed it would be better by then but I could cancel the appointment later if needed.


Within a couple hours I could not hear anything in my right ear, and my left ear felt muffled now. I called the clinic back, and they still couldn't get me in within less than two weeks. I called another clinic system that I have been seen in, and they are booked even further out. 


So, on day 2, I went to a local hospital emergency department, because I thought they could at least get me started on oral steroids. The PA I saw seemed insulted that I'd waste his time with an earache, and he suggested I might just have fluid in my ears so I should go home and follow up with primary care (his notes said my RT eardrum was slightly opaque and might have fluid behind it, but no signs of infection or anything else). 


I was persistent, but I was totally caught off guard by this person who had never heard of sudden hearing loss and who did not want to consult with anyone else. I was scared and probably came across as a bit belligerent as I tried to explain what the condition is and what some possible causes are and what my prior treatment has been, but that he should follow up with another doctor ot resource and use his expertise to decided how to proceed. I wish I had printed off information from google for this guy. Between my fear and his attitude, it took a while for him to be convinced to call the hospital's on-call ENT who informed the correct next-step: high dose prednisone for a week and then titrated down, and I was directed to call their ENT clinic on Monday and they would get me in to be seen (their clinic was close to closing time) So, I got the steroids, and they have been working.


While I was waiting for the ED to decide what to do with me, I called my normal clinic's nurse line to see if they had any advice, or if I should go to a different hospital or clinic? They put a call in to their on-call ENT,  who said there was no reason for treatment and I should go home and take Afrin.

I saw the ENT I was referred to at the new clinic yesterday and got an audiogram - my hearing shows up better on paper than I'm actually experiencing it, but it's definitely much worse than it was before (and of course my HAs haven't been adjusted yet). I'm also experiencing things like increased tinnitus, sound distortion, and extreme sensitivity to the sounds I can hear loudest. That doctor of course wants me to go to the clinic's doctor who specializes in ears/hearing. I'm still waiting to get that scheduled. 


After all of this, my normal clinic called and offered me an audiogram appointment for today, but still no doctor visit until the appt I have 10 days out (with another PA - not even the ear specialist who has seen and treated me before).


I'm absolutely confused about all of this. I don't understand how the nurses and doctors at my normal clinic no longer understand that sudden hearing loss is an emergency. I'm guessing that I shouldn't have called the clinic until my hearing was totally gone. I hate to think about the people with sudden hearing loss being told by their clinics that they can wait 2 weeks to be seen, or who are told to go home and wait for it to get better. I still am worried that I won't have the chance to do steroid injections again because of how long it will take to be seen.

There is a lot of info about otosclerosis on the internet. I'm not sure where to start to even direct you but it's not hard to find. I would be happy to share details about my experience.

If you are at the point where the hearing loss is mild and it's not affecting your day to day life, then the best thing to do is simply not worry about it too much just yet. Get your hearing tested regularly and monitor any changes. If it changes drastically (as it sometimes does with otosclerosis) then discuss your options with the doctor at the time. But it could be quite some time before you need any further treatment or surgical intervention.

Very unfortunately? I have SSHL. At least in your case they can fix it with surgery. In my case they can't do anything. So be glad! Be happy! And that audiogram? :)))) Really? Maaaaan.. you should see mine. is like a saw with dropps at 60dB then peaks at 15dB. You should be thankful man.. I was hoping it is otosclerosis from hell.

1mxnamo,HearingLoss,Adequate hearing protection?,"So I wore hearing protection at the movies: earplugs and earmuffs.  But the dB level in the theater, according to my meter, was often 105-110 dB.  Too loud.

I have ringing and diminished hearing, even with the hearing protection.  What else, other than not going to the movies, could I or should I have done to better protect my ears for two hours?

[댓글]
I got some head phones noise cancelling but didn’t turn that function on. Only documentary type movies with only talking no loud sounds 

Those decibels levels are insane

So, it should be a well known fact but is not said enough, if the volume after factoring earplugs in is over 75 db , it’s potentially damaging . 33 db Earplugs properly inserted will give you in a real world setting (33-7)/2, so about 13 dbs of protection. Earmuffs add about 5 to that. So, let’s be generous and say 20db. You’re getting hit with 85-90 db, which is fine for a normy for a bit, but is gonna f you up if you have hearing issues. There’s nothing else you can do. It should be illegal, there’s no point to it. I’d take a bunch of antioxidants like magnesium nac, A, E, in high ish doses for a week or so, it’s been shown to reduce permanent damage. You should be ok, like 90 peak if the average is in the 70s isn’t that bad.

1mx1icy,HearingLoss,What's wrong with my hearing?,"Hey guys,

I'm hearing less and less with nearly every day for months now, feeling like I'm going to be deaf soon. It all started with brutal reactive musical tinnitus seemingly after B12 Injections, however I'm not sure if that is just co-incidence.

However for the past few months since april essentially every montone sound with a wide spectrum of frequencies would trigger that. I've heard a lot of music I don't wanted to, especially from fans or AC-Machines.

Now I can't hear sounds like that anymore. Everything with a wide sound spectrum is essentially gone. Car engines, many parts of music, AC's, White/Pink/Brown-Noise and so on. I really have to watch out to not get run over in the city.

Also speech recognition is impaired especially in older people or people with high voices (woman, children).

However, I am still able to hear frequencies up to 20.000hz, but they are broken. Sinus-tones sound either squeeky, frizzling (16.000hz especially is like neuropathic tingling in my head instead of a tone), ""metallic"" or whistling. If I play 7000hz for example, it is like some painful frizzling hiss is passing through my ears.

I'm affected biliteral, even though the ride side seems to be a bit worse.

Hearing aids are no solution, since no matter how high of amplification, my brain is either receiving a bit of distortion or essentially nothing at all even though all sinus-tones are present.

I'm also suffering from neuropathy in the head really feeling like it is indeed the location of the hearing nerves. My MRI of the brain a few months ago came out clean &amp; therefore they refuse to take another.

However, I've been to a university medicine center here in germany in which they currently do a lot of testing. Sadly they don't really know what to do since my test results seem to be pretty much normal.

I'm suffering from chronic dehydration which I had a lot of trouble fixing, that's been going on from january to early august. I suspect chronic dehydration, potassium/sodium deficiency, which the injections made worse, as the reason for my hearing loss/issues but no one is believing me anything with the test results.

What do you think about the test results so far and what can I do?

I'm having trouble with everything because I can not understand most on the phone, listening to music is impossible, so is watching videos, I can not understand my niece when taking care of her with her squeeky voice, and as I said there also seems to be no solution with hearing aids &amp; I'm afraid of getting Cochlear Implants later in life with them not even functioning because it may be a weird neurological issue.

Next week they're doing a brainstem-evoke test, but it's only up to 4k &amp; I guess there won't be any results either.

My hearing feels absolutely worse since 2020 and 2023, last times I got tested. Hearing then was mostly low end of okay, sharp drop-off at 8k into mild loss. 

I don't make much but I'm saving to go back to the audiologist. I saw a kiosk with the logo of a well known audiology company and sat down for their test, and was shocked when it was all in the green, totally fine. I went home and got my noise cancelling headphones, and found a home test that checks background noise and calibrates headphone volume. THAT test was very different, saying everything was now in mild loss! I don't really have the money to spare if it turns out the kiosk test was accurate and my hearing has fixed itself.

People say loud TV is a give away. I got autism though. I just put on subtitles, I can't stand the loudness of the soundtrack and effects. In quiet environments I often have to ask people to speak quieter because it's sensitive and overwhelming. But add any amount of background noise and I can't hear them with my hand to my ear, and they have to speak up three or four times before I get them. Or if I'm facing away from them/they face away from me, or in different rooms, no chance. But I still mostly function without hearing aids. I think. I do see people say it's like glasses where you don't know what you're missing. 

Which shitty unofficial test is worth staking my $$$ on? The one in the kiosk by the company, but in a crowded mall? Or the one in silence, but I could have calibrated wrong?

1mwp6p9,HearingLoss,"27F Asymmetric SNHL with Tinnitus Overnight — ENT says 33% chance of full recovery, here’s my audiogram, anyone with similar results?","Hi all — on 8/17 I woke up with sudden hearing loss + constant tinnitus in my right ear. Freaked me out, especially since I’m 27, healthy, and just had my annual done and my bloodwork and exam showed I was healthy and didn’t have anything to be concerned about.

I looked up sudden hearing loss and saw it’s considered a medical emergency, so I went to urgent care the same day. Unfortunately, the doctor just sent me home since there was no infection/blockage. They told me to “wait a few days and see” — which I later learned was a mistake 😭. From what my fiancé researched steroids should usually be started ASAP and urgent care doctors can prescribe them so if anyone else ever experiences this — don’t just get sent home. Ask about starting steroids right away!!!

⸻

**Timeline:**
* 8/17 – Onset of sudden hearing loss + tinnitus.
    * Same day – Urgent care → sent home with no treatment.
* 8/20 – Was the earliest I could see an ENT. Audiogram showed severe hearing loss in my right ear, left ear perfectly normal.
    * Started on Prednisone (oral steroids). ENT said if no improvement by next week’s repeat audiogram → might try intratympanic steroid injection.
    * MRI (brain/IAC w &amp; w/o contrast) scheduled in 2 weeks to rule out retrocochlear lesions (ENT said tumors are rare but possible).

⸻

**Additional Info:**
* Current meds: Sertraline, Propranolol, Topiramate
    * Fiancé was worried Topiramate caused this since tinnitus/hearing loss is a known side effect
    * ENT thinks unlikely since it’s only one ear but still decided to taper off Topiramate just in case
* Symptoms: Had some imbalance + headaches early on, but they went away after 1–2 days
* Prognosis from ENT: ~33% chance full recovery, ~33% partial, ~33% no recovery — stressed that treatment window is only about 30 days from onset

⸻

**Questions for those who have gone through or are going through similar:**
* Has anyone here had similar audiogram results?
* Did you recover fully, partially, or not at all
* Any advice on things that helped you through the process?

⸻

My anxiety is through the roof right now and I’m just nervous especially because my hearing loss seems so severe 🥲 I’d love to hear about your personal experiences whether positive or negative. My fiancé is an absolute gem and a wonderful support system but I don’t know anyone else in my life (especially at this age) that’s been affected by hearing loss so really just looking for all the support, reassurance, and advice I can get ♥️",2025-08-21 22:23:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mwp6p9/27f_asymmetric_snhl_with_tinnitus_overnight_ent/
1mwhq08,HearingLoss,NervGen Pharma's NVG-291-R Demonstrates Significant Functional Recovery in Department of Defense-Sponsored Preclinical Models of Traumatic Hearing Loss and Peripheral Nerve Injury,"Hi I have a spinal cord injury and there is a drug, NVG-291 that recently went through a clinical trial for people with spinal cord injury.  It had success in improving motor connectivity in the hand.  It is currently under FDA review.

Anyway, the Airforce tested the drug on rodents with  traumatic hearing loss.  Researchers found significant recovery of hearing loss from the drug.  The article is from newsfile.  Figured I would share the details.

• Demonstrated significant hearing restoration in blast-induced sensorineural hearing loss models
• Promoted significant functional recovery and axonal regeneration in peripheral nerve injury models
• Reinforced NVG-291's broad therapeutic potential with new data across three distinct injury models

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - August 21, 2025) - NervGen Pharma Corp. (TSXV: NGEN) (OTCQB: NGENF), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class neuroreparative therapeutics for spinal cord injury and other neurologic disorders, today announced positive preclinical results of two Department of Defense sponsored studies in models of blast-induced sensorineural hearing loss and peripheral nerve injury, reinforcing the broad therapeutic application of its first and potential best-in-class candidate, NVG-291.
Presented at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium, the studies show that NVG-291-R, the rodent variant of NVG-291, promoted significant functional recovery in models of blast-induced sensorineural hearing loss and peripheral nerve injury, two debilitating conditions affecting military and civilian populations.
These preclinical findings build on the recently announced CONNECT SCI Study topline results, the first proof-of-concept study to successfully demonstrate that pharmacological treatment with NVG-291 translates improvements observed in animal models into electrophysiological connectivity and clinically meaningful functional gains in individuals living with chronic spinal cord injury.
Novel Preclinical Findings in Blast-Induced Sensorineural Hearing Loss
Conducted by the U.S. Air Force's 59th Medical Wing in collaboration with the Uniformed Services University, Brooke Army Medical Center, NVG-291-R was investigated as a potential novel treatment for blast-induced sensorineural hearing loss.
• Significant Hearing Restoration: In a rat model exposed to shock waves, either a single high-pressure blast or a series of low-pressure blasts, daily subcutaneous NVG-291-R treatment led to statistically significant improvements in hearing thresholds across all frequencies by end-of-study at Day 30, preventing the profound and permanent hearing loss observed in untreated animals.

""Sensorineural hearing loss from blast exposure is one of the most common and debilitating injuries affecting our service members. Currently, we can only offer hearing aids or cochlear implants, which don't restore natural hearing,"" stated Colonel Michael Davis, MD, FACS Former Director, U.S. Combat Casualty Care Research Program, Defense Health Agency. ""To see a systemic drug significantly improve hearing thresholds by potentially repairing the underlying nerve damage is a groundbreaking step forward. This could fundamentally change how we manage acute acoustic trauma on the battlefield and beyond.""",2025-08-21 17:37:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mwhq08/nervgen_pharmas_nvg291r_demonstrates_significant/

I've always enjoyed making music and I feel like losing half of my hearing is such a damper on life. I'm hoping the doctor was just telling me the worst-case scenario, but I don't know. I just want to break down currently, being told my hearing will likely never come back at 25 feels like the end of the world. I know it isn't and I can still love my kids the same, and eventually the tinnitus should fade some but man.. I have no idea how to even begin to cope with this

What bad luck my friend, I'm going through the same thing. I am 34 years old, I do not smoke or drink, I am healthy, I have had sudden deafness for 60 days but I am still undergoing treatment. From everything I've read, sometimes corticosteroids cause improvements in 3 weeks or more or even months. I am trying everything I have available: oral corticosteroids, intratympanic injection, hyperbaric chamber (HBOT) and today I just started the first acupuncture session (as an alternative therapy). I have not had any improvement like you, but there are documented cases where the improvement comes after months, each person evolves differently, do not lose faith. I have realized from my experience and reading quite a few reddit posts that doctors mention the options step by step, but in my case I would have liked to take a corticosteroid and do HBOT at the same time, but since I am new to the subject I did not know. But try everything in your power, keep fighting!

Hello brother. I noticed people in the west (say that because I'm from East Europe) throw away Meniere diagnostics in left and right. Well first of all this is pretty rare to start with, 0,2%! From 1000 people 2 may have Meniere. Is normal to feel dizzy and experience vertigo if your hearing dropped. Do you have an audiogram to share with us? My only concern is the hearing didn't change at all in those days, even if you are under ""fire"" from both antibiotcis and steroids. On the other hand is not too late. Some improvement may be seen after you quit the steroids. There is no way to cope with this. I'm 6 months in and I lost my hope. Me an my g.f. we are doomed. We sleep few hours a day. I could get used to the hearing loss but not the tinitus. Do you have also diplacusis disharmonica? Hear different pitches of the same sound differntly in Left or Right ear: I took tons of vitamins. l

I was diagnosed with SNHL bilaterally at the age of 15. I won’t lie it sucks. They also tried to convince me it was meniere’s and I did a low salt diet for years. It didn’t change a thing, my hearing actually continued to get worse. Hearing aids never did anything for me either because making sound louder didn’t help me understand it. I recently got implanted with cochlear implant 4 months ago and it has been life changing. I went from only understanding 15% of words in a sentence to over 97% just in the first 4 months. 

Just keep your head up and explore your options! If cochlear implants aren’t an option now, there are hearing aids that can help make things a little better. I feel for you.

I'm so sorry this has happened to you. I have long term left side Meniere's loss and recent right side SSHL loss. Music is my #1 emotional outlet, so it's been hard adjusting. I imagine you feel similarly. It's ok to grieve. Please talk to someone if you feel like it's too much.You don't have to do it alone.

Are hearing aids an option?

Yes this is indeed insane. Hearing, vision are assumed to be stable lifelong abilities. Try to take it one day at a time! Don’t layer emotions from this is frustrating to now life isn’t worth living because of the lost. Keep going!!! I hope you find some peace!

Get some injections done. 3-6 of them, do it urgently, start tomorrow, pay for it and don’t worry about the cost. 

If you’re at 60-80 now you have a good chance of a jump up a few notches into 50-60 kindve range. From there a HA will be a viable option. 

The tinnitus doesn’t really go, don’t pin your hopes on that, but you do get used to it and it stops becoming a problem. Same with the hearing loss, it goes from being world ending, to a minor inconvenience in certain scenarios.

Look up this paper on PubMed about Constraint-Induced Music Therapy. (CIMT)

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3905271/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3905271/)

Some parts are very technical but skip the parts you don't understand or skip to the conclusion. 

The idea behind CIMT is to keep your affected ear stimulated and your 'good' ear from overcompensating and reorganizing plugging your hearing ear and playing music into your affected ear in order to revive the connections. The ""dose"" is six hours a day. I'm doing it as I type this. Six hours sounds like a lot, but. you can do all kinds of things while getting your music therapy. The most important thing is to have sound waves continuously moving into your affected ear even if you can't clearly hear them. 

My DYI. set up is pretty easy: I put an earplug in my 'good' ear, a bluetooth earbud into my affected ear and noise cancellation headphones over both, and I play music I'm familiar with. I have a playlist of songs I know really well. 

When I started this 11 days after onset - which was 40 days ago- I heard nothing. I only knew the music was playing because my phone said it was. Over the course of a week I began to hear little tiny metallic bursts now and then that became more constant and something like buzzing and then there a beat and over time something that sounded like a mosquito music, a mosquito was band playing. The change was slow but I kept with it. Now the mosquitos sound like cartoon mice singing and playing instruments, and I can recognize the songs. I'm a cartoonist and I'm making comics about this and posting them on my instagram page  [https://www.instagram.com/thenearsightedmonkey/](https://www.instagram.com/thenearsightedmonkey/)

I'm also getting acupuncture which I believe has made all of the difference. There are some good papers about acupuncture and SSHL on PubMed but the upshot of the meta review is that outcomes were better with acupuncture combined with standard treatment than with standard treatment alone. 

I've seen improvement, significant improvement with both of these additional therapies, considering I was stone deaf 40 days ago when I got the correct diagnosis and treatment on day seven after onset. The progress is slow, slow, slow. 

And who really  knows if what I'm doing is making a difference? Who really knows what causes SSHL? It is so poorly understood, so understudied and it's such a complete crap shoot. 

But just being able to DO something about it myself like CIMT or getting acupuncture has been so meaningful.

Please share your audiogram so we could help you better. Dizziness alone doesn't mean meniere, but it's a negative prognostic factor in SSNHL.

I’m pretty much in the exact same boat you are. Our charts are very similar. I woke up this past Monday with most of my hearing gone in the right ear and loud ringing. Got steroid shot hours later, oral steroids now, clean diet this week with fruits and veggies. I’m a healthy person as far as I know. 5’10 155. It’s been a rough week. The ringing is just so loud in my right ear. Not sure how anyone gets used to it. I’ve been terrified all week that I’ll wake up and my left ear will be the same. No improvement over the first 5 days. Let’s hope this gets better. My fingers are crossed for both of us. Im sorry to see there are so many of us. My ENT said there was no proof HBOT works. I was sad that she wouldn’t send me to try anyway .You just never know.  [https://imgur.com/a/bQXVMhs](https://imgur.com/a/bQXVMhs)

I am also currently fighting a bad case of swimmer’s ear. I work in healthcare and have always struggled to use a stethoscope but after this infection I am terrified even to put the stethoscope ear pieces in my ear. I know there are stethoscopes comparable with big over-the-ear headphones, but that seems really clunking to have to be taking on and off over and over again all day. I am wondering if there is anything out there that uses bone conduction, maybe a low profile bone conduction headset that I could just wear all day and a small Bluetooth stethoscope?

Today, I took another test because I have tinnitus and I noticed it’s louder.

The test says I don’t have hearing loss. Did my hearing get better, or are these tests wrong? What’s going on?  The first is from today and the one on the bottom is from last year and the final was from 2 years ago. These are at different audiologists. Thanks in advance. 

[댓글]
So if I'm reading it right you has a normal one, the one with the 8k dip, and then another normal one? I would say you probably either missed the beep and the tester didn't go back and double check (can happen) or you just had a natural variation that day, which also happens. Maybe you had some sinus issues affecting your ears (can not be noticeable) or listened to something loud around that time, a lot of things can cause variation. A lot of things can also cause tinnitus. You probably don't have any permanent hearing loss but just had an off day and something else is causing the tinnitus.

1mvhjop,HearingLoss,"Help, wat te doen","Gehoorproblemen,

Ik heb begin April een geluidstrauma gehad op beide oren door een piep van 8 en 12 khz. Dit geluidstrauma heb ik direct gemeld bij de huisartsenpost. Daar gaf men aan dat er niets aan te doen was en ik maar af moest wachten. Omdat mijn linkeroor pijn begon te doen (enorme druk) ben ik bij de huisarts geweest. Deze stuurde me terug naar de kno waar ik op dat moment al voor tinitusklachten kwam. Bij de KNO is een hoordiagram gemaakt op 7 April.Deze liet op dat moment normaal gehoor zien. Ik heb ook nog normaal spraak. Op 8 April begonnen de problemen. Toen hoorde ik in het slakkenhuis wat knetterende geluiden. Radio en tv kijken wilde ook niet meer. (Dat is nu nog steeds aan de orde) Ik heb heel vaak met de KNO gebeld vanwege de enorme pijn en druk klachten maar vond daar geen gehoor.Ongeveer 1 week daarna kreeg ik hyperacousis. Ik ben heel overgevoelig geworden voor geluid. Autorijden wil ook niet meer vanwege het geluid in het slakkenhuis. Bij de KNO is er nog een scan gemaakt voor een brughoek. Deze zag er goed uit. Ondertussen veel over en weer geschreven met de KNO. Ik wist niet van de medicatie en van de zuurstof die eventueel gegeven zou kunnen worden. Geen van de partijen heeft daar destijds over gesproken. Ik heb dat wel terug gecommuniceerd naar de kno. Maar kreeg daar geen duidelijke bevestiging op.Nu zit ik na bijna 5 maanden met hele zere oren volledig thuis en die reageren op geluid.

1mv29w8,HearingLoss,Higher pitch,I started experiencing a change in pitch perception about 2 weeks ago. Especially music. Everything sounds higher pitched. Even peoples voices sound like everyone has been sucking helium. I started playing with a pitchbender program and I discovered that my pitch perception is off exactly by 1 semitone. If I lower music I put through the program 1 semitone it sounds exactly perfect. Same with peoples voices. I’ve been doing research and I can’t find any cases where it’s a uniform 1 semitone across all sound. I went to the audiologist and he said I have sensorineural damage but it’s not that profound.

1mux3ws,HearingLoss,"5 months of hearing issues (dull sounds, hard to hear in noise) but normal tests – what should I do next?”","**sorry for the long post, tried to give as much context while being concise** 

For the past 5 ish months I’ve been experiencing some hearing issues particularly volume wise. Sounds just seem a little duller and less loud than usual. I have an issue hearing conversations in the midst of background noise. I first noticed this issue when I got sick. I was told that I was likely dealing with allergies and a flu virus, and that was likely causing pressure to build up and was told to take allergy medicine and a nasal spray. Long story short, that didn’t really help my hearing so I went to my primary care doctor and was told that it looked like I had an ear infection. I was prescribed antibiotics which didn’t help either. I finally went to see an ENT where an audiology test was performed, and it came back that I passed the test with normal looking hearing and a slight dip in my left ear with higher frequencies but it still fell within the normal range so nothing too bad. So on paper and on the surface, nothing looked wrong. I was told to continue with the allergy medicine as this was still around spring time, and I have bad pollen allergies. Fast forward a couple months into summer, and still no major signs of improvement. I went back to the same ENT and the pa said that everything looked fine again and recommended I get allergy tested, because she thought allergies might still be the culprit. I got allergy tested and it confirmed my bad pollen allergies but that didn’t make sense due to it being mid July at the time, and pollen wasn’t really a factor anymore. Also the audiology test didn’t show any major signs of any eustachian tube dysfunction, so I didn’t fully believe that allergies were to blame. I went to a second ENT to get another opinion this time from a doctor not just a pa, and I was told that everything looked fine when they looked into my ears, and the audiology test showed the same as the first one with a slight dip in my left ear that still falls within the normal range. I thought maybe Ménière's, due to volume issues but I don’t have any vertigo so I don’t know if that’s it. I don’t know what to do at this point or what next steps I should take. I know I’m experiencing something but going to the ent, hasn’t helped me figure anything out. This is greatly effecting my mental health as I’m in college and this has had an impact on my ability to socialize properly. Any advice would be greatly appreciated regarding next steps I should take.

Sorry about your experience. It is possible to have difficulty with hearing in noise and still have normal or very mild loss. You are not imagining this and the research is showing that a basic audiogram is sometimes not enough. 
That dip in your hearing could be impactful for you. If possible I would suggest you try and see an audiologist that can perform a speech in noise test who can assess how well you hear in noise. See an audiologist with an interest in hidden hearing losses.

Okay thanks I will definitely check out an audiologist next",2025-08-19 22:23:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mux3ws/5_months_of_hearing_issues_dull_sounds_hard_to/

Ear fullness. It's very common with hearing loss. I have it too. Some people say it fades in time.

The fullness can actually be your brain’s interpretation of not having sound. When I was fully “deaf” in that ear, I felt full and numb! The pressure comes and goes but really faded when I stopped “checking” for it and told myself it wasn’t really full. Now…. 14 days out, I have no idea if that’s true.

I had been sober for a year before my SNHL hit and I was so grateful. Alcohol is toxic to the delicate structures of the inner ear. I guess it depends on how much you want to drink, but alcohol is toxic. Period. Grateful for sobriety after being a heavy drinker for years.

I been slowly drinking but the audiologist said it just triggers tinnitus like caffeine smoking and drinking but she never said it would make it worse

Smoking thc or cigarettes?

Alcohol is rather toxic.  It's toxic to the nervous system in general.  The inner ear is particularly sensitive.  Drinking is associated with balance disorders and hearing loss.  But as the same time, will one beer make you go profoundly deaf?  Probably not.

1mtx25t,HearingLoss,Mixed feedback on hearing loss + lack of steroids at outset (3+ months),"Hi all,

I wanted to share my story to see if anyone has had a similar experience: in late March I took a flight. Upon landing, I had mild ear fullness with no tinnitus or noticeable hearing loss. I also went to an event where a woman screamed to get her mom’s attention a foot from my head so I thought perhaps the fullness was thanks to that.

The fullness went away a week or 10 days later. I never saw a doctor because I attributed it to my ear, needing to pop from the flight or something mild. Big regrets now.

In mid July, I began to feel slightly floaty – not dizzy, fully functional, but just a little off. I thought maybe it was low blood sugar or dehydration, but research into the vestibular system led me toward an audiologist. My results are attached. The floaty feeling has been dissipating with time and vestibular PT.

I’ve seen two ENTs since and have mixed feedback regarding whether this is temporary or permanent. I never received steroids or anything of the sort and it’s been three months. Neither ENT suspects Meniere’s. I have an MRI on Thursday.

I’m wondering a) if anyone has had a similar (or partially similar) story, b) if there are any audiogram experts here who can weigh in on what type of hearing loss this is and c) if I should push for steroids at this point, or if anyone has recovered after the 3 month mark of initial fullness. Would appreciate any insights you have to share!

The first shot was very unpleasant for me. Moderately painful but not crazy. Lingering feeling that my ear was stabbed/pokes for a couple days. Not pleasant. 

Second injection was way better, honestly nothing to mention really. Unpleasant for a few seconds then recovered well. I have my third soon and expect it’ll be fine. 


There is a risk of eardrum rupture but I read a study that said it’s like 1% or less of injections…

They numbed me (slightly) for the first perforation. The next 2 shots they used the same perforation.  You will IMMEDIATELY get vertigo, but for me it passed within a minute each time.  

I unfortunately had no positive results. My T changed slightly for a period of time.

Luckily I had no time to think about it. It sucks, but so does losing your hearing. Nothing traumatic.

Unfortunately it was terrible for me. Twenty minutes after the injection I had terrible dizziness and vomiting for 5 hours. I couldn't move in the hospital bed, just constant vomiting while the world was spinning around me. I felt like I was dying. I didn't even take the second injection.

I would go to the ENT and see what they say because if the hole doesn't heal on its own I think it can cause hearing loss. They may advise a follow up appointment to see if the hole is closing.

Yes follow up with ent to make sure it’s healed

I am also battling swimmer’s ear, possibly a ruptured ear drum as well (ear canal is too swollen to see). My ENT said it doesn’t matter too much because the drops he ordered are sometimes used to help heal a ruptured ear drum.

I don’t live alone and use full back headphones 🎧 for my PC, but it’s not cool at all, after like 15 minutes I start use only one ear and then switch between them every 10 minutes but even this not help. When I go to sleep I notice my ears ringing more.

So I wonder maybe bone conduction HP will help? I’m gonna try them anyway, but want know your opinion first. I miss so much my healthy ears.

Have you had your hearing tested?

Do you think it's the fit of the headphones that hurts, or the volume? If you give the headphones at your volume to someone else with normal hearing, do they say it's loud?

I'm somewhat picky about headphones because if they squeeze my head at all it hurts and I have a huge head lol.

Tinnitus can be cause by noise exposure, hearing damage (your brain can fill in frequencies you aren't hearing) , or it can be ""idiopathic"" which means no known cause. Some medications and neurological conditions can cause it too. If it's noise exposure lowering the volume would help, but if you have hearing loss from listening too loud hearing aids can help by filling in the noise for you so your ears don't fill it with tinnitus. So figuring out the cause is important.",2025-08-18 07:29:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mtfc6c/bone_conduction_headphones_i_cant_use_regular/

It’s not just frustrating — it breaks my heart. I can see her pulling back from conversations at family gatherings because she can’t follow what’s going on. She misses jokes, important details from the doctor, even little everyday things that keep her connected.

I know it’s not her fault, but it wears you down as the caregiver. You’re stuck between not wanting to nag and also worrying about her safety when she can’t hear the doorbell, alarms, or even me from the next room.

Has anyone here found something that actually helped bridge that gap without making them feel “old” or singled out?

Hey, audiologist here! I’m so sorry to hear you’ve been going through this. Hearing loss really affects the entire family. I’ve seen it so many times where the parent is in denial and it’s hard for the family to navigate things.

I created a video on my IG on how to approach hearing loss with a family member- https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMIbeq_tzBS/?igsh=MTk1Z2I3dTBhMXJjZQ==

I hope it helps! X

theres lots of modes of communication outside of spoken. you should think about how to best accommodate her and hearing devices arent her jam. lots of deaf folks get on just fine without hearing aids",2025-08-17 22:34:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mt4sop/anyone_else_struggling_with_getting_their_parent/

Yes… with time is getting worse

Also, I want to ask one more thing
All my other frequencies are normal in both ears , 8k at left ear too

How come if this is NIHL, it affected only one ear?

i wouldnt consider hearing aids, but could be noise induced. usually the dip is at 4k or 6k but im sure it could be 8k too. protect your hearing going forward. it could have been one loud event that caused it and only effect one side (many people have that from things like shooting or really anything that happens on one side of
your body and not the other) or could just be anatomy. one ear could be more resilient than the other",2025-08-17 13:18:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1msqpcr/dip_of_45_at_8k_in_one_ear_problematic/
1msml9v,HearingLoss,Pain in ears 4 days post acoustic trauma,"Four days ago I was exposed to what I believe was 114dB (house alarm) for around 5 minutes. I got an audiogram done two days later and my hearing has decreased from well within the normal range to some frequencies being borderline mild hearing loss. I feel that I can't hear as well and sound is not as detailed. Should I go to the doctor about this? The audiologist said it was probably temporary but I am scared because I have already experienced hearing loss due to loud music and I also have tinnitus.

[댓글]
The reality is that nobody can tell you if it’s temporary or not, only time will. We’re at day 5 now, has it improved at all? Your ears can only tolerate about ~1 minute at 114 dB before risk stacks up, so 5 minutes is already several times beyond safe exposure. I hope it got better and your tinnitus didn’t get worse 🙏

If it helps, here’s what happens in the ear; basically, oxidative stress: the hair cells’ mitochondria pump out excess reactive oxygen species, and at the inner hair cells the nerve connections can get overstimulated and damaged. That’s why sound can feel duller or less detailed even if some hearing thresholds come back, it’s not just the cells, but also the wiring to the brain that can take a hit.

We recently wrote more in depth about this issue, synaptopathy or hidden hearing loss, which can lead to tinnitus and/or hyperacusis, I’ll leave the link in case you want to dive in deeper: https://soundbites.com/pages/tinnitus-and-hyperacusis

But also using too much earphones is causing some wax build up, and using headphones can get sweaty cuz my ccity is quite humid, and heavily air polluted. I presume i'm gonna get judged

[댓글]
You won't be judged cuz are not our ears. You can learn something from this community or go your way. I will tell you my story. 44 years old. Music my hobby. Spent a lot of time with my professional grade monitors (headphones for professionals) on the head. The damage in your inner ear is cumulative. Even if you don't experience a sudden drop in hearing doesn't mean your inner ear is ok. At 44 I lost my hearing in the right ear. Left lost some frequencies also. My life is a nightmare. Now is time for you to choose. Keep in mind almost all the people that worked with music, or in clubs, etc.. have some degree of hearing loss in ears. The drummer from Nirvana is an example, Sting another one, Phil Collins had also hearing problems.

What do you want us to say? Once you have your hearing irreversibly damaged, you wish you hadn't listened to music that loud all those years.

To be fair, i wouldn't want to wish hearing loss on anyone with normal hearing, the days where you noticed the difference and comparing to the past makes you wish you could go back to the past to change it. Don't know about you, the constant reminder of the loss has been making me so depressed. Just imagine not being able to hear the treble, bass, hi hats in the music will cause quite a grief.

1ms3a1c,HearingLoss,my good ear is now muffled/robotic/out of tune,"for a little backstory: 
i’m a 22 year old female, i lost hearing in my left ear in september 2023. it’s severe/profound. i also struggle with severe tinnitus in that ear. i’ve habituated pretty well over the last, almost, two years. as for my right ear, it’s been pretty much perfect. hearing test came back perfect earlier this year. 

current events:
i woke up yesterday with a muffled right ear and light vertigo. even when i’d close my eyes, it felt like the world was sliding in opposite ways. as the day progressed, the muffled feeling actively progressed. but the worst part was what i was hearing, i could hear my own voice and it was robotic? i can hear double from my right ear. music is out of tune… i was a casual musician and music lover prior to losing my hearing. i pride myself in my scarily accurate pitch and tone. music sounds wrong. the melody is there, but there’s a breeze-like sound in my good ear with a DIFFERENT melody. it makes everything sound like a creepy version of the song, an out of tune piano.

what i’ve done:
immediately went to ER. they gave me a dose of roids, and they called up the ENTs who reside in hospital. i have an appointment tomorrow morning. getting an audiogram and seeing whats up.

has this happened to anybody? i am FREAKED out. the one thing that got me through the initial hearing loss and extreme tinnitus was music. it’s the ONE thing in my life i rely on, everyone knows more for this. i’m so worried. it’s already been 24 hours. is it just an infection? i’m so confused. and scared. all over again.. thank you

Hello, can you please post your audiogram when you have it? Cover personal data, I'm interested only in your audiogram. You pointed  out some nice things in there. In my case the first round of steroids worked in some degree, but even some dB returned I had diplacusis disharmonica (when the same sound has different pitches in left ear compared to the right). I match frequencies over 2khz. Everything under that is sounding messy, compressed, distorted. Then my hearing went down again, another round of roids, another small recovery. I repeated this game like 4-5 times, when I called it a day since using them too much may lead to bone loss, or even worse some necrosis in your body. From that day my hearing is going down little by little. I'm very worried about your ""good ear"". 2 years ago I had a sudden hearing loss in my left ear. It recovered partially but I have huge dips at 4khz and 8khz. Then my right ear (same pattern same symtoms). Well the right ear is clearly lost for me. Now I'm scared about the left one.

Don’t stress! The best thing you did was seeing an ENT quickly—I truly hope you gain back your hearing. I was diagnosed with SNHL three months ago while I was on vacation, just chilling in a new state. Sadly, the ENT there stopped my treatment too early, after only six days of oral steroids, saying I was already recovering. I really wish I had been at home at that time. Since then, life has changed a lot—going from being social to becoming unsocial is painful. I find myself avoiding sound and spending the whole day in my room, and it really hurts..

Long story short, I lost my hearing last November 2024, and didn't realize it at the time. When I got an actual hearing test in January 2025, I found out I lost lower-frequency hearing, though I think it was worse in November and December. Fast-forward to August 2025, 9 months after onset, I had actually improved some, so hopefully I can keep improving. I've attached some screenshots of those.

Tinnitus is much quieter than before, though it's still there.

I hope everyone has a good day.

[댓글]
Have you done anything that you think has impacted the improvement?

6 months soon! Since 7 march! The most frustrating is that with steroids at some point I gained a lot of my hearing back! When I stopped it returned back to the loss! I can’t take anymore steroids! I risk other complications. I don’t want to be deaf and with femural necrosis or worse. I tried any supplements you can imagine! I read sooooo much about it I could take an ENT exam really. Now since a month ago is dropping little by little. I’m afraid I will loose my hearing for good!! The bad part is I can’t afford hearing aids either. Country with small salaries but the prices are the same. Is very depressing. The tinnitus doesn’t help. I could accept the idea of hearing loss without the tinitus maybe but both is too much for me. I became a psychiatry pacient! I make panic attacks and drop Xanax, drop antidepressants yet doesn’t help! I want my hearing back! That waiting list to the MRI and angio doesn’t help either. I’m afraid having a tumor or a blocked blood vessel. The problem is I’m from Romania and here the medical system is a mess. I don’t know if we have the tech to place stents in the brain are. I googled up about it but I found no place. I know nothing about except my hearing is degrading.

What frequency is your tinnitus?

I have 200hzish and though not especially loud, find it very intrusive and 'deep.'

Is this Mimi app? Or just you uploaded your audiogram into Health? I'm asking because Mimi doesn't measure under 250hz. Usually the audiologists are measuring down to 125hz and i don't see that in your posting. Keep in mind Mimi app is way off specially in the low frequencies. Mine is 30dB more optimistic than the real tests.",2025-08-16 17:21:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ms1l6m/update_on_my_low_frequency_ssnhl_and_tinnitus/
1mrrtfs,HearingLoss,Need reassurance or tips on my SSHL prognosis,"29M. Stupidly, attended a very loud gig without any hearing protection. Noticed muffled sound in my left ear immediately after it was finished. About 12 hours after the onset, had my ears cleaned at an ENT's. Muffled sound persists, went for a follow-up the next day. Did an audiogram, which showed mild SSHL in the lows, and a moderately severe drop (to about 70) in the highs (right ear is completely unaffected). Was prescribed deflazacort, now on my day 3. Tinnitus barely noticeable from the beginning, and only in very quiet spaces.

This is earth-shattering, as my whole life revolves around music, professionally and otherwise. What prognosis am I looking at here? Do you think I'll make a full recovery? If not, do hearing aids help in situations like these? Thanks in advance for any advice.

out of curiosity for anyone in the group, is this considered SSNHL? i dont think it is considered that since it was noise induced?

Seeing as they have cleared you for now I’d give it a couple of weeks and if it’s still not better go back and ask what they would advise. Hearing aids amplify sounds so in some situations they work and in others they don’t, that’s likely something you will need to discuss with an audiologist.

in my case my hearing got better than worse a few times and now is worse.. so .. yeah.. I had like 36dB loss medium. Same problem worked with music. I lost mostly in the low frequencies initially, but then the 4khz and 8khz took a dive... soooo yeah..",2025-08-16 10:51:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mrrtfs/need_reassurance_or_tips_on_my_sshl_prognosis/

yeah my best advice would be to: forget about blasting your ears with headphones. you should listen to your doctor.

I have conductive hearing loss.
Bone conducting headphones are an absolute game changer.

Shokz seems to be the brand to go for and I've been using them for a few years now. Something to look out for though is that some models are not 100% bone conduction and have small speakers directed to your ear. I find these are less loud (as less sound is transferred from only bone conduction) and other people can hear what I'm listening to.

For this reason I'll be trying these models that are 100% bone conduction:  
OpenMove  
OpenRun (not Pro) - Most likely these  
OpenSwim  
OpenComm 2 (boom mic for work) 


All others like OpenRun Pro / Pro 2 have external speakers.",2025-08-15 18:25:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mr61mx/earphones_recommendations/

1mmwds9,HearingLoss,A bad experience with an ENT,"A couple of days ago, I saw an ENT. I was having some hearing loss in my right ear, and in my left ear, I was having pain, occasional drumming, and a feeling of pressure as if there's water in the ear.  In fact, I've gone to urgent care a couple of times in the past due to balance issues, and was told it was due to water in the ears from allergies.

A hearing test showed that I have minor hearing loss in the right ear, but that it's within the normal range. This is baffling as I don't hear well in a crowd. I'm 60, and they said my hearing is good for my age.

As for the left ear, she totally blew off my symptoms and claimed the ear looks entirely normal. She said the pain could be from TMJ due to a lost tooth on the upper left jaw, which I disagree with. I'm guessing that since I have Sjogren's Syndrome, which I told her about, and she confirmed from the dryness of my mouth and nose, that it's Eustachian Tube dysfunction.

I also saw, using a cheap home ear scope, that I have a chunk of ear wax lying on my eardrum, which is likely causing some of the symptoms as well. I can't believe that she didn't see this when she looked in my ears. I've tried Debrox and haven't been able to get it out. I don't know what to do about it.

I came away from the appointment feeling as if it was a waste of time and money. I'm wondering if others have had a bad experience with ENTs or have any other suggestions. Thanks.

That’s too bad.  If possible, find another ENT in your area, ideally at a local university hospital.

I have a ton of bad experience with ents. Get a second opinion! Ask to get ear micro suction  out

I have.   Apparently, some ENTs are ""just"" surgeons.  Too good to clean ears.  Then there are others who actually care and get stuff done.   Most certainly, the world needs good surgeons.   But most of the time, we need a good solid ENT.  One who cleans ears and checks for negative pressure if we have ETD.  And prescribes ear drops as needed.


Yes, I've had this problem.  And you either have hearing loss or you don't.  Perhaps mild or restricted hearing.  But seriously, hearing loss in the normal range isn't a thing.   I think they are gently telling you have some very mild age related hearing loss that they do not feel needs treatment with hearing aids.  But that should be something you decide.

I had gone to this clinic since I was 5 years old.  I ended up going to the ENT in the clinic network.  He's kind, hard working, and best of all, actually explains what is wrong down to drawing pictures.  I have CSOM that went untreated for nearly a year.  My current ENT is using a more conservative approach right now, and I feel much better.  I think the surgeon didn't explain as I would never have allowed a chronic ear infection to go untreated that long.  It's my best guess he was planning surgery.  There may come a point where that is appropriate, but not today.

My reccomdation would be a referral from your primary care.  They generally know the ENTs who do a good job.",2025-08-10 22:40:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mmwds9/a_bad_experience_with_an_ent/

Still can’t hear anything.  But I’ve been reportedly getting worse at being too loud and yelling at people.  I can’t tell.  I feel like i’m being way too quiet when they say i’m a normal volume.

Let the doctor who did the test explain it to you.

You have some hearing loss, you can look at the speech banana and compare it to where you loss is

anything over 25 is considered a loss, it seems like the only dbl your over in is about the 125  range though all your hearing is right on the boarder of going above 25, talk to your audiologist about it and see what your next steps are,

There is a difference between the bone conduction and air conduction threshold  at a few frequencies. That could be due to fluid in your ear or earwax or even just because the headphones weren't sitting well on your ears when they tested your hearing. Right now it's probably not something to be too concerned about.

Overall your hearing is good, most of your thresholds are within a range that is considered ""normal"". You will want to continue to monitor it as you get older to see if you have some kind of degenerative problem.",2025-08-09 11:19:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mln0ak/im_23_and_just_received_my_my_test_result_i_would/
1mldu0c,HearingLoss,"Perdida auditiva, hipersensibilidad, crisis exitencial y tapones para oido","Hola, paso a relatar mi problema a ver si alguno le sucedio algo parecido y como lo vive...

soy musico, profesor de musica, tengo 24 años y estaba por fin comenzando un proyecto personal como productor, el cual le estaba dedicando mucho amor, y hace aproximadamente 2 meses y medio empeze a percibir de una manera muy incomodos los sonido, en especial la musica, acudi a diferentes otorrinos y luego de hacerme las audiometrias correspondientes me dicen que tuve un ""trauma acustico"". fue por no darle el descanso suficiente al oido.... ademas tambien este trauma desperto la ""alguiacusia"" que hace que tenga una hipersensibilidad y dolor en ciertas frecuencias o timbres.

en estos meses sufri bastante esta perdida, fue como un duelo, la verdad es que antes sentia que la musica era mi motor de vida, le dedique los ultimos 10 años, y actualmente me siento perdido, y nose bien que hacer, no quiero dejarla, pero ya no logro que me trasmita lo mismo que antes, y me pongo a producir y a los 10 minutos mis oidos quedan muy fatigados y con dolor. cuando salgo de mi casa uso unos tapones para protegerme de los sonidos del mundo exterior (autos, musica fuerte, lugares con mucho tumulto de gente)

 

adjunto foto de mi audiometria, se ve que tengo principalmente un declibe en los 4k y va bajando, me gustaria saber que sucede despues de los 8k hz, que yo creo que ahi es donde tambien se siente la diferencia, estoy viendo de hacerme una audiometria de alta frecuencia que es la que llega hasta los 16k hz a ver que es lo que da..

1mkpu80,HearingLoss,What is this?,"I bought one of them ear cameras as I've had issues with my right ear for years. I had a test done at my opticians and they can't send a referral to the hospital, but ask I get in touch with the hospital for a scan on my ear as he believes something further internally is causing my hearing loss.
Going back 10 years ago I had a scan etc at the hospital and they said everything is fine. Back then I wasn't able to hear much out of my right ear. They said theres a noticeable difference on the hearing test but nothing shows anything is wrong, so I've put up with this for years. Always asking people to repeat themselves is annoying and when laid on what I call my good ear, I can't hear anything around me. I had to buy this ear camera to see for myself what these so called professionals are seeing. Yes I see the blob of wax on the side but is that my ear drum? Or built up wax? Its pretty far down and worry I might damage my ear drum if I mistake it for wax.

[댓글]
Please do not put anything in your ears or try to clean them yourself. This is the #1 cause of ear drum damage, and includes q-tip regular cleaning use. 

A large portion of the function of an ear can't be seen, and is behind the eardrum and other physical biological tissues. If a Doctor is mentioning something further inside may at cause, it may not be visible to the human eye, or a camera. It's worth following up with them.

A nice hot steamy bath and staying hydrated can help the natural cleaning process of your ears to clean out wax as you bathe however.

Yes that is your eardrum. The little yellow bit is wax.

It’s hard to tell. Go to an ENT practice that has an otoscope with video capabilities. Call ahead and ask “does this practice have video capabilities”. I’m sorry you are worried!",2025-08-08 08:36:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mkpu80/what_is_this/

1mkkxrn,HearingLoss,Rapid hearing loss,"To start off-I don’t want anyone comparing their audiogram to mine. This isn’t what I’m after. Apologize if I sound rude, just I’ve had enough comparisons 

February I noticed that I developed persistent tinnitus that made me schedule an appointment with an audiologist to see what was going on. A month later I went in and was diagnosed with bilateral SNHL as most of my OAEs were documented to be absent or near absent. 

I finally had a MRI today to rule out anything insidious and nothing came back but I’m still having unstable hearing loss. Doctor prescribed me prednisone in hopes to stabilize/improve while also referring me to get genetic testing. With my thyroid history as well, I’m leaning towards Pendred syndrome. 

Does anyone have it or know somebody that was diagnosed? I would like some information while I’m waiting for the next step in seeing what’s causing my symptoms 

[댓글]
Are you tired during your second audiogram? Fatigue can cause a difference of 5 to 10 decibels compared to the actual result.

Have you had hearing loss from a young age? Hearing loss associated with Pendred syndrome usually occurs from birth or early childhood, however it is certainly possible for it not to occur until adulthood it’s just rare I think. It’s always worth speaking to doctors about these things :)

I had profound hearing loss in February. I think something like 90% of the cases are unexplained. I also have autoimmune thyroid issues… doc insisted it wasn’t related but I don’t think they know.

I had a somewhat similar experience with rapid hearing loss that didn’t fully stabilize after prednisone. While waiting for more answers, I found it helpful to try a hearing aid early on rather than waiting to see if my hearing would improve more. I used [this one](https://rewarduplevel.com/aff_c?offer_id=1904&amp;aff_id=36719) it’s affordable and discreet, and helped with everyday sounds and conversations while I continued with medical follow-ups.

Looks a little overdue.

I am not a doctor nor an audiologist, so this is just how I would interpret if these were my results. Please call your provider for your exact results explanation and next steps.

You seem to be missing a lot on your right side. It seems to be a mild to profound conductive + SNHL on the right. However, you’re right sided Tympanogram seems to be type B. I would follow up with an ENT to further evaluate this. 

Your left side seems to be a mild to moderate SNHL with a type A Tympanogram, which is what I am used to seeing. 

Again, not a doctor, but I’ve been in hearing aids since birth. Best of luck, and take it all one step at a time.

How can you hear much of anything in day to day life? 

You have quite significant hearing loss in both ears dude and definitely need hearing aids.

I like to  upload to my audiogram to ChatGPT and ask for an interpretation.   I’m sorry about your hearing loss.

1mjxbhc,HearingLoss,Needing advice!! Failed hearing tests,"Hello! I am newer to Reddit so hopefully this finds the correct people to either provide me with some advice or at least some solidarity. Googling at this point has given me many mixed answers so hopefully there’s someone out there who’s been in my position. 

For context:
We have a fresh 3 y.o. who began having recurrent ear infections last fall after starting daycare. He had 4 infections from Oct-Dec and then also had strep/double ear infections in Feb-Mar. Each infection was treated by a dr who prescribed antibiotics. I had him seen by an ENT in April and he failed an OAE test on both sides and it was also discovered he had fluid behind his left ear drum. We proceeded with tubes. A month after the tubes, we had a follow up appt with ENT. He failed his OAE again. Dr checked him out and felt he shouldn’t have failed the OAE (tubes were open and in place, and no fluid was present). They redid the test the same day and he failed it yet again. We were sent to a specialist the next month where he did pass the OAE however they did a behavioral type hearing test and it was discovered he was best responsive to the task at hand at 50 dB. Lower dBs he wasn’t responsive to and would just sit in my lap when they were talking to him through the microphone. No reaction to the sound at all. When we met with the ENT specialist, she had pulled out a graph and made two lines at 20 dB and 40 dB. From what I understood, typical hearing in a child should be about 20 dB and he’s sitting at about 40 dB. Maybe someone can help answer that a bit further too. We are currently in process of him having a sedated ABR done to do further testing on his hearing as well as speech therapy. 

Both sides of the family do have some that are hard of hearing as well as recurrent ear infections and prior ear tubes. With that being said, I’m not sure if this is only because of the recurrent infections and the fluid, or if genetics are playing a factor into this as well. 

At home, he tends to be most responsive to louder noises/voices (I have to speak fairly loudly to him to get him to somewhat respond). He is best responsive to deeper tones of sound or deeper voices. He babbles a ton and has a few words in his vocabulary but the more I think about this all, I feel he is fairly loud. More typical than a 3 year old IMO. He will not respond if at all if I just talk in a normal conversational tone unless I am inches away from his face. In my gut something is telling me his hearing is being hindered but others like daycare disregarded me and my feelings regarding his current situation so to say this has been a very stressful time is putting it lightly. 

It has been a very long 10 months trying to get answers and I’m just hoping I can maybe find someone out there who’s been in my shoes or can provide me further information as to what I should do further if anything at all. Thank you, all. ❤️

it sounds like he may have a mild hearing loss based on the information your doctor gave and your description. normal speaking level is around 60db and mild loss is inbetween 20/25 db and 40db. mild loss primarily shows up in challenges with background noise and missing some quieter speech sounds (i.e th, s, etc). that may be why there are discrepancies between people on how well they think he is hearing. an ABR would be my next recommendation for you (as a deaf person with experience in getting diagnosed, not a professional). i THINK they even have something called an ASSR which is similar to an ABR but can actually chart their exact audiogram. 

 good news is that just from experience, it sounds like a conductive loss. there are 2 types of hearing loss: sensorineural, conductive, and technically a third which is a mix of both. if it was caused by infection or ear fluid, it is likely conductive, which can often be fixed with treatment. 

the other good news is, if it is SN hearing loss, it is mild which hearing aids can be great for :) often with mild loss speech can be heard, but its quiet/unclear so a boost from amplification is generally very successful

Keep on it. It's better to overtest than to miss a hearing loss. I? Think? In the USA if that's where you are insurance companies HAVE to cover things like hearing aids for children. I wish I had been diagnosed earlier because I could have gotten hearing aids way earlier and not felt so isolated. It may be awhile until he is old enough to get very reliable results on things like speech comprehension, I'm not super well versed on that. 

My ""soft"" advice is: Love him and raise him to be confident and not view hearing loss as a shortcoming. Make sure that if he wants to be social he can be. Go out of your way to make sure he gets his play dates and try to make sure he gets a solid group of friends as he grows up. That's not to say force him if he's naturally shy, but if he shows interest in something social like a sport or club, make sure he can go. We don't know when my hearing loss started but I was known to be an introvert and pretty quiet in social settings as an older child and teenager, and I really wonder if it was my hearing loss making me feel lost and isolated because as soon as I got my hearing aids I became an extrovert. I could suddenly interact with more certainty as to what I was hearing and be more confident in my conversations. Still socially inept bc of other developmental things but I'm much less shy.

I somehow passed the newborn hearing test but my speech was pretty messed up as a toddler and my parents finally got me to an audiologist when I was 4 to discover I needed hearing aids. My parents were told I was likely born with it, so it’s a little different than what’s going on with your son. But my hearing loss is conductive and dips all the way down to 60dB and I didn’t get relief until I was 4 - I think almost 5. 

I hope you find some answers!! But if he does end up needing hearing aids, don’t stress too much about that time he didn’t have them! I went through speech therapy and you’d never guess that I was hearing impaired now if you interacted with me",2025-08-07 11:17:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mjxbhc/needing_advice_failed_hearing_tests/

Week two no improvement went to Primary care and they confirmed fluid in ears and gave me antibiotics 

Week 5 tiny improvement or no improvement went to ENT he said no fluid and scheduled me for audiogram 

Week 6 Audiogram and Dr said I have SSNL severe. Mind you during the test I could hear tones I just could not distinguish spoke word part
Next day started cortisone shot in the ear(I insisted even though Dr said it was late) ***** 10 hours later and I can hear spoken words way better, still not as good as good ear but better than I have in 6 weeks.

Next time ask for Tympanometrie to see if there is any pressure imbalance. Also when visiting your ENT ask if he can check your eardrum whilst you're doing the Valsalva maneuver. If you're tube does not open and you're eardrum doesn't move its likely ETD.

I've had surgery for otosclerosis in both ears. If you have the procedure performed by an experienced surgeon, the likelihood of a good outcome increases substantially, so find a good surgeon if you can. I would not let a surgeon do this procedure unless they specialize in middle ear work or stapes work specifically.

Tinnitus, in my experience, has been psychosomatic. When I had the surgery and my hearing improved dramatically, most of the tinnitus I was experiencing resolved. But this varies from one individual to another. It's hard to predict how a successful stapedectomy (or stapedotomy) might affect your hearing, but if it resolves your hearing issues to the point of it being something that you don't think about all the time, then it's a good possibility that tinnitus would become less intrusive (even if it doesn't resolve entirely).",2025-08-06 14:38:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mj6fbp/newly_diagnosed_with_otosclerosis_severe_tinnitus/
1mit920,HearingLoss,"Muffled Dialogue in Movies and Games (System-Wide Windows PC, Channel-Specific Fix for Headphones - Especially If You Have Hearing Loss)","After YEARS of whisper-quiet dialogue being drowned out by music and explosions, I finally fixed it — and it works across the entire system, not just in VLC or one app. Now, this is for WINDOWS PC. I have tested this with several headphones and DAC/AMPs with/without.

This method lets you:

* ✅ Boost **dialogue (center channel)** only
* ✅ Tune **specific frequencies** per speaker
* ✅ Adjust **each speaker/channel volume independently**
* ✅ Apply it **system-wide** (games, YouTube, Netflix, VLC, etc.)
* ✅ Tailor it to your **hearing loss** using an **audiogram**

**🚨 IMPORTANT: Source Must Be 5.1 or Higher**

This fix relies on your media having a **true 5.1 (or 7.1)** audio track.

Why?

* Dialogue is isolated in the **center channel** in surround mixes.
* Stereo (2.0) audio has **no true center channel**, so boosting dialogue selectively is **not possible**.
* **Dolby Atmos for Headphones** virtualizes the full surround field (including center channel) for stereo headphones — letting us isolate and EQ it.

||
||
|**Source Type**|**Works with Dialogue Boost?**|**Notes**|
||||
|Blu-ray / MKV rips|✅ Yes|Best case — full surround mix|
|Netflix / Disney+|✅ Usually|Confirm surround is active|
|YouTube / MP4s|❌ No|Usually stereo — no isolated dialogue|
|Games|✅ Yes|Most modern titles output 5.1+|

**🧰 What You’ll Need**

||
||
|**Tool**|**What It Does**|**Cost**|
||||
|**Dolby Access**|Enables virtual 5.1/7.1 surround w/ center channel on headphones|**$14.99 + tax (one-time)**|
|**Equalizer APO**|Core engine that filters audio system-wide|Free|
|**Peace GUI**|User-friendly interface for per-channel EQ and volume|Free|

**🔧 Step-by-Step Setup**

**1. Enable Dolby Atmos for Headphones**

* Install **Dolby Access** from the Microsoft Store
* Go to Sound Settings &gt; Output &gt; Spatial Sound
* Set to: **Dolby Atmos for Headphones**

✅ This creates a **virtual surround mix**, including a proper **center channel**, even through regular headphones.

**2. Install Equalizer APO**

* Download: [https://equalizerapo.com](https://equalizerapo.com/)
* During install, make sure your **headphones/output device** is selected
* Reboot after install

**3. Install Peace Equalizer GUI**

* Download: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/)
* When prompted, click **“Yes”** to overwrite config.txt
* Launch Peace and choose **Full Interface**

**🎚️ Boost Dialogue &amp; Tailor to Hearing Loss**

You can now:

* Adjust **each channel independently** (Center, Left, Right, Sub, etc.)
* Apply **per-channel EQ** (e.g., boost only dialogue frequencies on the center channel)
* Apply **different EQ per ear** (Left/Right) using your **audiogram** or hearing test

**Example: EQ for Center Channel (Dialogue)**

||
||
|**Frequency**|**Gain**|**Purpose**|
||||
|500 Hz|\+2 dB|Adds warmth and low-mids to voice|
|1000 Hz|\+4–6 dB|Boosts vocal clarity|
|2000 Hz|\+4–6 dB|Adds presence and enunciation|
|4000 Hz|\+2–4 dB|Consonant sharpness|
|8000–16000 Hz|\-2 to -4 dB|Reduce sibilance or hiss|

We used a real **hearing aid audiogram** to shape the Left and Right channels for hearing loss, and EQ’d the **center** for dialogue boost.

**4. Save Your Preset**

* Click **Save**, name it something like: Dialogue Boost - Custom Hearing
* You can bind it to a Peace hotkey or slot (Set 1–4) to toggle on/off

**🎯 Why This Works Better Than App Fixes**

Most apps (like VLC) only boost center within the app. This setup works:

* 🔄 **Across all apps &amp; games**
* 🧠 With **custom hearing loss profiles**
* 🎮 In games (like Call of Duty, Elden Ring, etc.)
* 🖥️ On **YouTube, Plex, Jellyfin, Netflix**, WHEN SUPPORTED WITH 5.1 AUDIO SOURCE and more

**🧪 Bonus Tips**

* ✅ In Peace, enable **“Prevent Clipping”**
* 🔊 Lower Preamp in each channel if EQ boosts are too loud
* 🎧 Works great with Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and games
* 💬 You can boost center *and* shape full headphone sound signature

I’m hard of hearing. Hearing aid in one ear. Completely deaf in the other. I’ve reading about cochlear implants because I am thinking of getting one. There was discussion on another board about whether there was a way to use a different volume with each ear for training purposes when getting a new cochlear implant.

1mifmvq,HearingLoss,Explain my hearing loss,"Can someone explain my hearing loss?

I’ve had hearing loss since I was around 6 or 7, but I never got hearing aids despite a report showing it.

My father also developed hearing loss in both ears around 16 after pneumonia.

I can’t remember any other cause for my hearing loss. I do remember severe earaches in early childhood, which may have been an ear infection.

Interestingly, my 2-year-old brother also has hearing loss in both ears. He recently had a 1-year-old son and was diagnosed with mild hearing loss in one ear.

No other family members have hearing loss.

Doctors and genetic testing haven’t found an explanation.

Can anyone suggest a possible cause?

Also, can someone comment on my hearing loss results and advise if it worsens? My hearing is muffled, but I can still understand people I know.

Am I considered deaf? Apologies for the silly questions, I don’t really have anyone to talk to or understand my hearing loss.

1mi5fez,HearingLoss,Audiogram is fine but my ears sensitive to sounds and get easily tired,"Still have sound sensitive and quick tired/discomfort ears after 2.5 months (M23)

There was a month when I start overdoing AirPods listening time, tho it was with volume 30-56db. At night I listen audiobooks and couple times even accidentally slept with it on minimum volume. At mornings I watched movies with them, at day I sometimes listened music.

One day I used AirPods Pro for 2 hours for music and then 2 hours just ANC mode without music, I remember how I turned ANC off and notice how my ears react to people voices in the room, they was loud to me so I turned ANC again without music. At evening my right ear was ringing, at morning my both ears was sensitive to sounds. 

Could ANC cause some ear pressure changes? I sometimes noticed it cause ear tired quickly if it cancelling some noises like running tap water. Also after trauma I tried 1 AirPod in my left ear cuz it was better then right one and after I turned ANC I immediately felt discomfort in my right ear! Not the left one. 

2.5 months later, I didn’t use any headphones all that time cuz I just can’t do it anymore and my ears still more sensitive to sounds, if I try big headphones 🎧 for 15 minutes my ears would be tired for any sound until next day.

I had checked with doctor, they made tests and said my nerves not damaged and they don’t know what causing my sensitivity. They said I should check my neck with MRI, I didn’t done it yet but also I doubt it could be neck problem. My sensivity clearly appeared after overdoing AirPods, it smth with my ears, not with neck.

1mi0uot,HearingLoss,hidden hearing loss,"well i've been to two ents and had my hearing tested 3 times. one by sams, two by audiologists. they've all come back normal but ever since i experienced some loud trauma to my ear two weeks ago it hasn't been the same. my hearing with background has gotten better since then but listening to music, tv, etc is it feels like there's been a pillow place under my ears. idk what to do i love music more then anything and i can't help but wonder if i have cochlear synaptopathy. feeling real sad about and trying to cope is hard 

[댓글]
Hi, I'm glad my hearing has returned to normal. Is cochlear synanopathy currently just a medical theory to describe a hidden hearing loss despite a normal or even perfect audiogram? Is there any evidence on your audiogram that the frequencies around 4000Hz are lower than the others? This could explain your symptoms?

could be high frequency loss. speech falls within 250hz-8000hz which is what is tested on typical audiograms. frequencies higher than that can definitely effect music though

I’ve had hearing loss for years due to ear infections, but last year my right ear suffered a cochlear ischemia, and since then, I hear as if I were underwater. The good thing is that when I turn up the volume, sounds become more normal. I’d say my issue has to do with the outer hair cells, which are responsible for sound clarity and volume.  
Another thing I’ve noticed is that I now hear conversations more normally with my right ear, which wasn’t the case a few months ago. In that sense, I’ve improved a bit, although I still have trouble understanding speech in public. I rely heavily on my left ear.",2025-08-05 05:34:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mi0uot/hidden_hearing_loss/
1mhmrcz,HearingLoss,I don't have anyone to tell this..,"Hi guys, I've been feeling like it's impossible to keep myself positive and optimistic lately..

A month ago at such a completely random time when my parents were outside for a trip I got this ringing noise in my right ear, it was more like wind or car engine. I thought it would go away on it's own for awhile, I've waited waited it felt like faded away but it was never truly gone. Anyway I got my first Ent appointment, I did a hearing test, barely heard it but still did so it qualifed as a normal hearing? I've kind of kept pressing the button over and over out of anxiety. They checked my ears there wasn't anything in sight so they said it's probably just stress. 

I've decided try to live with it and accept it in this span of time but there were times that it felt like or still feels like it's completely gone but no, during this time I've went for a holiday it consisted of high altitudes and mountain like places when I came back I've had this insane ear ache, headache, and clogged ear feeling. I haven't felt these symptoms before.. I feel like I am losing my hearing, I don't know what to do instead of waiting for my appointments to come and be positive but I'm really losing it :/

I just know that something is not right but which doctor I go can't diagnose me, I've been feeling lost because since they couldn't diagnose me I haven't received any medication or medical treatment as well. 

I just feel like if I really lost my hearing I feel like, I won't be able to experience stuff from now on as good or won't be able to enjoy myself like I did, even if they weren't lasting too long.. that's all I've wanted to say, maybe it was just a vent, I don't know but I hope we all find some hope soon.

I'm sorry this is happening to you. Although I'm not a doctor, I would try to understand your problem. Unfortunately, your post does not contain enough data. Do you have the results of a hearing test? Please attach the audiogram to the post.

It might be the brain, neurological issue or something else. Maybe do a MRI.

Seeing my problems, it is most likely that you are going through some inflammatory problem, since the initial ringing could be a symptom of that inflammation, although everything that has to do with the inner ear until the hearing loss passes, the ENT specialists do not act, why do you go through this inflammatory period? Due to viral infections, TMJ problems, the immune system itself going crazy, etc. There are people who have recovered hearing even years after its loss. I myself have lost hearing due to infection and it has recovered after the inflammation, I recommend seeing inflammation of the inner ear and some anti-inflammatory prescribed by an ENT specialist.

All your symptoms point towards something call Euchastian Tube Disfuction. Essentially your ear cannot equalise pressure properly. Have you had a cold recently? Or perhaps any allergies? 
It explains why your symptoms worsened changing altitude on holiday. 
Symptoms of ETD include: Earache, feelings of pressure, temporary hearing loss, ringing (tinnitus) and occasionally distorted sounds. 
My advice would be following. 
Go buy a nasal steroid like Flonase or Beconase. Use it twice a day. 
Try breathing in steam through the nose for ten minutes. 
You could also try a nasal rinse, just to help clear out any potential congestion. 
Don’t panic, it’s usually very treatable and there’s a strong chance that your tinnitus and hearing loss can get better.

Call your doctor‘s office and ask them to email you a copy of your hearing test. 

If they may say you have to use their patient portal, get instructions for that. Either way you should be able to get a copy of your test pretty quickly because they have it in your chart.",2025-08-04 19:13:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mhmrcz/i_dont_have_anyone_to_tell_this/
1mhm1v9,HearingLoss,Sound while wearing earplugs is just as loud as the sound without them,"I'm debating going to a concert where the sound levels may reach up to 120db. To avoid damage and potential hearing loss I'll be wearing earplugs. I have -18db ones that are made specifically for loud music. However, at the last concert I wore them at, the sound with them on was seemingly identical to the sound without them. They claim to limit the volume of the sound without reducing its quality, I don't know if that's the same as the sound being pretty much identical though. 

These are the earplugs if that helps.

[댓글]
I suggest finding ones that have a higher decibel reduction. maybe 25 ish db? if the concert is really loud, a lot of the time, you'll still hear it pretty clearly. the ear plugs will increase the time you can be safely exposed to that sound level longer.

Be sure you jam them in your ear really good.",2025-08-04 18:47:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mhm1v9/sound_while_wearing_earplugs_is_just_as_loud_as/

He feels it could be Cochlear hydrops but can't say for certain.

I have no vertigo. The swelling like and heaviness feeling in the right ear mostly resolved after ENT put me on serc and dyazide. However the constant fan like throwing in the Right ear is showing no improvement, infact sometimes get more intense. I have Tinnitus ranging from birds chirping and electric in the left ear, ironically starting on predisone. I had a consultation for hyperbaric oxygen therapy and the dr there told me i had wax in my left ear and should get it removed. Called ENT office and staff advised dr hve said to put mineral/olive oil but don't get it removed. I started putting it 3 days ago and the T almost felt gone after 2. I felt bit of the electric shots yesterday but nothing dramatic and today woke up to feeling slight T in left too but i don't know.

This ears thing have me got so confused. I see the ENT tomorow and will have my hearing test done as well. I don't know what to ask, expect. As last time he was clear there are no definite answers or treatments or even recovery.

It sounds like you are doing many of the correct things - good for you.

Unfortunately, not much funding, relatively, goes to hearing research because it's one of the ""silent"" health issues. According to [NIDCD](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/funding#:~:text=NIDCD%20is%20the%20nation's%20leading,nationwide%20and%20around%20the%20world), [ASHA](https://www.asha.org/public/coverage/p4audfundingresources/#:~:text=The%20National%20Center%20for%20Hearing,whose%20parents%20choose%20that%20option), and some others, hearing loss is the third most common chronic physical condition in the US, more prevalent than diabetes or cancer. However, in 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocated only 0.4% of its total budget to hearing loss research.

This is one of the reasons the ENT is saying there are no definite answers.

So, some of the things you can do are to get educated (like you're doing now) and educate others so more funding gets allocated to hearing health to find additional ways to help people like you.",2025-08-04 16:02:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mhhh24/what_to_ask_expect/

Now 37, is there a way to definitively diagnose what actually caused my hearing loss?","Any ENT I've ever seen has said that nothing looks out of the ordinary when looking in there. My mother never realized how severe my hearing loss was (despite me telling most everyone that I'm mostly deaf in my left ear, as it was easier to explain), so I never got a hearing aid growing up or any treatment (or accommodations). Didn't even know I could treat it with a hearing aid until I was in my mid-20s, which has been hit-or-miss so far honestly. I have my hearing tests somewhere from a year or so ago, but for reference I listened to one of those YouTube videos that plays the range of normal human hearing: 20Hz-20,000Hz, and my left ear goes silent at about 1,450Hz while my right goes to about 5,500Hz. I wish I knew what caused it or what the specific issue actually is that causes this kind of hearing loss. Is there a way to find out without breaking the bank? Is there a way to find out at all?

My newborn son has severe mixed hearing loss in his right ear. We are having trouble reducing the hearing to normal/mild/moderate levels with PE tube so far. Last ABR went poor, but it was clogged. My question is: was it extremely difficult growing up without being able to use one ear? How is your speech? These are the concerns we have as parents. I will try to accommodate him as much as possible in school/life.

Thank you in advance.

I woke up one morning deaf in one ear. I went to the ER immediately. I've seen tons of doctors since then. Every doctor I've seen has said that 80-90% of the time patients will never know what caused it. Your chances are probably much worse, since you lost your hearing decades ago. In general, it's good not to know. It means you don't have cancer or anything

1mfjr79,HearingLoss,I'm scared about my hearing.,"I've become very concerned about my hearing over the past year. For about 3 years or so, I've played drums in a ""Rock Band"" class in my high school. About 3 or 4 months ago, I was playing during a dress rehearsal for a concert, and one of the monitors (speakers pointing back towards the musicians so they can hear what's being played) was turned up way too loud. Although I eventually put in earplugs, it took probably about 4-5 minutes before I got a chance to put proper ear protection in. 

For the next couple of days, I had pretty significant tinnitus, to the point where it was disruptive/distracting to daily life. Although it hasn't been nearly as bad, I've also noticed slight tinnitus mainly in my left ear, mainly noticable when I'm trying to sleep or don't have much noise around me. I've been much more diligent since about using ear protection, but I'm worried that it's too late and my ears are already permanently screwed. 

I also heard a couple of weeks ago from a guy who's been playing music  I assume most of his life that it starts like how I described and gets worse over time throughout your 30s to 50s, and I'm terrified that I'm already headed down that path already and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm only 18 years old and I feel like I've already ruined my ears and I'm going to have to have to deal with this stupid tinnitus for the rest of my life and it's only going to get worse.

1mecbm4,HearingLoss,Return of Tinnitus and Hearing Anxiety After 1 Year on Sertraline,"Hi everyone,

I’m 20 years old and experienced sudden hearing loss in my left ear back in 2021.

In 2024, I had another episode — I felt like my hearing was worsening again, and I started noticing a slight tinnitus in my ""good"" right ear. However, my audiogram showed no changes in either ear.

This situation triggered a depressive episode, and I was prescribed 50 mg of Sertraline. Thankfully, the medication helped a lot — I felt much better both mentally and physically, and I didn’t notice any tinnitus in my good ear for almost a year.

But unfortunately, for the past month, those same symptoms have returned. I once again feel like my hearing is getting worse, and the tinnitus in my right ear has become a bit louder over the past week. I recently had another audiogram, and just like before, there were no measurable changes.

What’s bothering me a lot is that just over a month ago, I went to a nightclub for the first time in years — only for about 30 minutes and I wore earplugs the entire time. I felt okay back then, so I wanted to enjoy myself a little. But now I regret it deeply. I keep wondering if that night triggered all of this.
On the other hand, maybe I’m just looking for something to blame — what if the Sertraline has simply stopped working?

I have a psychiatrist appointment coming up, but I wanted to ask if anyone has gone through something similar.
Could the medication have stopped working?
Or is it possible that my hearing is actually getting worse, even though the audiograms don’t show any change?

Thank you for reading.

Tinnitus can be exacerbated by stress. So the more you focus on the tinnitus and worry about it, the louder and more continuous it seems to be.

It says normal right next to your thumb. Come on.

Want to trade?

This is a pure-tone test, and your results are normal, as indicated by the left side of the graph.

this is great hearing

This is the best chart I’ve seen posted in the sub. Your hearing is great. Most people here have graphs dipping down into the moderate, severe and profound loss regions. Yours is all up at the top. Not saying there isn’t an issue, but you are hearing really well regardless of your age.

Your audiogram is actually pretty much the same as the audiogram my audiologist showed me as what mine *should* be instead of what mine was

Take my hearing and give me yours in return

Normal. Eustachian tube was likely happy (open) for the test... If the pressure in your middle ear was irregular, you would have seen some elevated thresholds in the lower tones. Although it is possible your hearing is even better in the lows than the graph shows... Meaning this could possibly be slightly elevated for you.

My SNHL went unnotice until my 20s, but since my best friend in school was deaf on one ear, we always sat together in the front row in school, so i had little problems in understanding my Teachers.
Now that i have gotten hearing aids, life is easier especially using Induction Loops in  Lectures, theater and church.
Is there anyone out there with the same diagnosis?

1mdvx3v,HearingLoss,I cannot hear out of my right ear at all,"Hello I am a 24 year old male. Last week on the 23rd I went swimming and though I just got water in my ear that I could t get out right in that moment but a week later, yesterday, it still felt the same way. It just felt uncomfortable and was slightly hard to hear out of my right ear. Yesterday I went swimming again and it felt like I got more water in there and as the day went on it did not become any better. I know it was wrong but at this point I tried cleaning my ear gently with a q tip and lots of wet wax came out on the q tip but no change in hearing or feeling in my ear. I felt like I compacted the wax because after that my hearing was totally blocked out of my right ear. After this I went and got mineral oil, peroxide, and an ear cleaning solution with the rubber syringe. I first tried putting drops of peroxide in my ear and let it sit for 15 minutes. This made no change. Next I did the same thing with mineral oil and some was came out and then tried with the ear cleaning solution and some wax came out then too. After all three attempts I used the rubber syringe to flush my ear with warm water. No change in my hearing occurred after each attempt and I cannot hear out of my right ear except for the slightest bit ( like when you plug your ears but can still faintly hear the sounds around you). What should I do? Do I have an ear infection? Will it take care of itself on its own? Should I attempt one of the three previous attempts again today? Should I go to the doctor?

You should see a doctor immediately

This is something that needs to be seen by an ENT immediately. Tell them that you've lost all hearing in that ear spontaneously. Don't bother going into a bunch of detail on the phone with all the things you've done to the ear, just focus on the loss of hearing.

Go to see a doctor asap.  Losing hearing in your ear is considered a medical emergency. I wish I would have known this previously.",2025-07-31 08:19:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1mdvx3v/i_cannot_hear_out_of_my_right_ear_at_all/

grief is definitely normal, but stress will make healing so much harder. for now, focus on self care and be kind to yourself

Urgent care? also primary / regular docs and even nurse practitioners can prescribe steroids. (In the US at least)

They can’t do anything with acoustic trauma. Steroid is for inflammation. It won’t help.

Try to get on with your primary care. My pcp is who started me on steroids initially, I feel your pain- it’s scary and frustrating.

Er are expensive urgent care are not so I paid 100 and got seen and prescribed steroids brother go to urgent care not emergency hospital big diffrence

when it was me, a deep dive into the Deaf community was comforting. grieving is normal and going to happen! but seeing all of the culture and joy in the Deaf community helped me so much

Maybe consider making a fun little game of learning sign language a little at a time, starting with signing funny words/messages to each other. As you both slowly get better at it, it can be your own secret language within your household.

Ah thats awful at such a young age. Tinnitus is (for me) worse than the hearing loss. Its never ending and causes lack of sleep. 

If you post her audigram, I might be able to suggest good masking sounds/tracks to cover the frequencies that she is losing which will help with the tinnitus. 

  
Has she got hearing aids yet?

B12 shots helped me so much with the tinnitus

1mcvodq,HearingLoss,Advice for Next Steps?,"I need some advice for my 5 (almost 6) year old, please. He has had 2 tests with an audiologist, one showed mild hearing loss and one was basically normal. However, it seems clear to everyone around him that he has trouble hearing. 

Some examples: turns the volume up way too loud when watching screens. Talks loudly in normal conversations. Has speech difficulties. Doesn’t always respond when you call his name or talk to him - you have to get his attention visually or tap him on the shoulder sometimes. He definitely struggles in noisy environments, but not only in them. He has also flat-out said that he has trouble hearing. I also should mention that he did have meningitis at about a month old, but made a full recovery and no one ever told us that hearing loss could be a result long-term. We found that out recently when doing our own research. 

We’re seeing his pediatrician to follow up, but what should we ask for next? His doc is great and will get us referrals for whatever we ask for, but I don’t even know where to go from here. I read some things about tests that can be done for hidden hearing loss - is that a thing in young kids? This seems like more than an auditory processing problem, but could that be causing all of this?

Thanks so much in advance for any advice!

[댓글]
Poor guy. I hope you get the answers you're looking for.

i would possibly request an ASSR test. It is an objective test that will essentially give you his exact audiogram without him having to do anything. I would also find an Audiologist versed in auditory processing disorders

A referral to an ENT, perhaps?  I'd want a complete hearing test.   By that, I mean one that tests whether or not the hearing loss is sensineural or conductive.  If it's sensineural, then the next step would be hearing aids to make his life easier.  Conductive hearing loss can sometimes be treated surgically.  

If he's coming up with a mild hearing loss, you may need to advocate for the hearing aids.  Please check with your insurance to see how much they cover.   A good alternative for someone with mild loss might be Costco.  Costco has good HAs for apx 1500 vs. the amount I paid through an audiologist.

1mcrffd,HearingLoss,"Traveling solo for work trip, any advice for the hard of hearing?","So I have an upcoming work trip out of state I’m very anxious about. Not so much flying as I am socializing with colleagues. 

I work remote so I’ve only ever talked to these people via phone or video chat. I wear hearing aids, utilize Bluetooth and have never had an issue at work. While the aids help me greatly and I am completely dependent on them, I do struggle in social settings with loud background noises, people not facing me, or people who don’t clearly enunciate. 

I have disclosed this to them (the loud background and facing me while speaking) and they’ve been really great so far, but I am afraid I’ll be doing a lot of nodding/smiling/catching bits and pieces, or saying “what” a million times. 

I also recently say my audiologist to make sure everything is up to date.

1mcq62h,HearingLoss,SSHL question,"I lost the hearing in my left ear about six months ago due to SSHL. I took the normal course of steroids, even getting one shot in directly into the ear.  Unfortunately, the treatment was not effective. One of my biggest issues is with the constant loud sound I get in that ear.  Is this normal? Do other people experience the same loud sound. It’s not really a ringing sound like tinnitus more of a low frequency hum. 

It makes hearing conversations very difficult because the sound is distracting. 

If anyone has found something that helps this, I would appreciate learning about it  

[댓글]
That’s tinnitus.  It’s gets described as “ringing” but can “sound” like any number of things.  

Mine is sort of a loud low level electrical hum.  Almost like a louder version of a refrigerator or white noise machine.

I experienced severe/profound SSHL in my left ear 18 months ago and went through the tapered oral prednisone regiment as well as 3 prednisone injections in the ear.  My hearing showed 0% improvement.

The cornucopia of sounds (buzzing, roaring, polyphonic intervals, etc) was very bothersome.  AirPod Pro gen 2 helped a little bit but I ended up getting a Cochlear implant 1 year ago and the sounds have significantly dissipated.

Hope this helps.

You can try hyperbaric oxygen. I fixed mine, started hbot in 2 Weeks.

I have the same thing, same ear, same treatments with lack of results. I’ve just had to disassociate it.

Mine started May 11 this year.  All the treatments; constant sound.

How much hearing did you lose?

This is tinnitus and is normal with hearing loss. It is unlikely to go away. However, you can learn to live with it.

1mccgds,HearingLoss,My elderly parent can’t hear right but won’t get help,"It about puts me over the edge when I say something like “I took out the trash” and they reply something like “YOU TOOK OUT THE WASH!?” 

I ask can you get a hearing test and they say “I don’t have no problem hearing.. you mumble too much when you talk.”

Ironically, everyone I encounter of my own age hears every word I say perfectly fine. 

How do I force an elderly parent to get themselves a test followed by hearing aids?

[댓글]
I don’t know how you can force them, but I know that if you speak to them face-to-face, they should understand you all the time.

You can’t force them to get tested and get hearing aids.

If they happen to be at the point that they would allow you to join them for a regular doctor’s visit, you might mention it directly to the doctor while you’re in there.  Sometimes people will listen to their doctor over family members.

That being said … even with hearing aids, situations like this:

“It about puts me over the edge when I say something like “I took out the trash” and they reply something like “YOU TOOK OUT THE WASH!?”

Will still happen.

Hearing aids do not restore hearing to 100%.  If they are elderly and their hearing has been slowly declining over the years, the adjustment to hearing aids will likely be long and difficult anyway.

I would recommend that you work on accepting that your parent has a disability and get a bit of a sense of humor, or at least some compassion about little things like this. 

You will encounter other hard of hearing people in your life - and you likely have already without even knowing it.  Someone mishearing is almost never because of something they’re doing.  The only person who can change how your voice is heard is you.

Make sure you have their attention and are facing them when you speak to them.  Don’t cover your mouth when speaking, and don’t speak while chewing.

Experiment with standing a little closer and speaking at a comfortable volume.  You will start to learn how close you need to be for them to hear you, and what volume you really need to speak at.  Also, go for clarity over volume whenever possible.

I have worn hearing aids for over 30 years. Two other members of my immediate family also wear hearing aids.  We have a hereditary sensorineural hearing loss.

My elderly father does not have this hearing loss, but he has had a notable decline in his hearing in the last few years.  We have tried encouraging him to get hearing aids, but it hasn’t quite taken yet.

If you notice they need the TV at a louder volume than is comfortable to you, turn it down and tell them it’s too loud, and you can’t watch with them at their volume without fear of damaging your own hearing.  These are the moments that you can mention their need for hearing aids.

Don’t take the bait when they say you’re mumbling - you probably aren’t speaking up enough for them, but they also may have less frustration if they did try hearing aids.  You can suggest it every time they say you mumble, but don’t do it in anger.  

If your parent knows anyone else who has hearing aids, you could ask them if they would be willing to offer to bring your parent along on a trip to their audiologist.

My mom has been doing a bit of that with my dad.  They go to all of each other’s appointments now anyway.  I will probably invite him along to one of my appointments in the future.

You might even consider talking to an audiologist on your own about your concerns.  They may have suggestions - there is a big link between untreated hearing loss and dementia in elderly patients - and hearing aids can help with keeping the brain active.

Good luck, and try not to take it personally when they can’t hear you (I totally understand the frustration when an elderly parent won’t get care for themselves and it starts to affect you, believe me!)

My mother had problems hearing and the first thing we did was take her to an ENT. She was loaded with impacted cerumen. It helped immensely with her hearing after it was removed.

1matqoe,HearingLoss,Best hearing aids for speech clarity?,"Hi guys, I’ve asked this question before. I currently have Oticon Zircon hearing aids. But even when I adjust them to max levels on all the different settings (general, comfort, lecture, speech in noise) I really struggle with speech clarity. My doctors are fully aware of this but because I have a working diagnosis and an undetermined treatment plan I’m pretty much just left in limbo to suffer. So I am going to ask them if I should maybe upgrade my HAs considering I’m going progressively deaf. 

I’m wondering if anyone knows of professional grade HAs that work best for speech clarity issues? 

I’m an emergency nurse so understanding what my patients are saying to me the first time around is really important to me. Thank you! 

[댓글]
If you get the answer please let me know. I would love better speech clarity too

All the”upper tier “ HA are remarkably good, in fact little difference. Speech clarity is our most common complaint. We are simply unable to distinguish words very well. HA manufacturers are very aware of this fact. Technology is evolving, we can hope.

TY, it is our number one and most frustrating issue us HOH folks deal with

What we’re all looking for. I am trying Oticon’s premium right now. They work pretty well considering I only have 70% word recognition. I don’t think they work well in noisy environments but I was told they’re the best by one audiologist. Another audiologist also said I should try Phonak so I’m going to try that next. They have a dual processor, one for speech and one for noise. It’s a bit bulkier in size but not bad. I’m going in in the next two weeks to try the Phonak out. Not sure it will be any better but I’m going to try. Best of luck.

YES! My hearing loss happened overnight too. I thought there was something wrong with my hearing aids so I went to my ENT and they said I was deaf. Then I got admitted at Stanford since sudden hearing loss is a medical emergency. During that time my tinnitus went nuts (three different tones, all high pitched, maddening, I lost my job). I ended up getting a cochlear implant; with the sound it masks the tinnitus. But yes, this.

1madnwm,HearingLoss,"Progressive Hearing Loss – Looking for Advice, Support, or Shared Experiences","Kia ora everyone,
I’m (nearly 30F) from New Zealand and I’ve been coming to terms with a progressive hearing loss that I only noticed a couple of years ago (2023), when I was about 27.
I’ve now had three audiograms over the past three years (screenshots attached), and they show a significant drop over time, especially in the high frequencies. So far there’s no clear cause.

I’ve been wearing hearing aids (Oticon Jet2 mini rte) since 2023, which help in some ways but not in all situations and I’m starting to feel frustrated by my hearing. I’m also starting to worry a bit about what’s coming next for me, whether my hearing will keep declining, if I’ll end up needing cochlear implants, or how this will affect my work and life long-term. I’m also starting to wonder whether I’m doing enough or seeing the right professionals.

Have any of you been through something similar? What helped you in the long term and short term? What should I be doing now to make sure I’m prepared or supported?
Any thoughts, advice, insight, or shared experiences would mean a lot.

I'm 25F and was just diagnosed with progressive hearing loss this fall, even though I've slowly been losing my hearing since I was 19. I also use hearing aids,  but I still struggle with them. I dont have any advice or anything, but I have been thinking about my future and most likely losing more hearing as I age. The things I've kind of decided are the route for me right now are a hearing alert dog (I already have a multipurpose service dog for other things so I've trained him in a couple hearing tasks, but I'm also planning on my next service dog being a hearing alert dog and being trained in all hearing alerts), and I'm also reaching out to my local Deaf services to get back into sign language classes. I have personally decided that even if I qualified, I probably won't get Cochlear Implants for a couple of reasons, but I know some people do really really well with them. 

I know none of this was very helpful, but hopefully it's a little less isolating for you to at least hear from someone else who is in a similar boat as you.

I can completely empathize. I was in the same place many years ago.

Some things that helped me...

1. I generally knew what to expect because others in my family have some hearing issues. So, I grew up seeing how much worse it got and what they did. If you don't have family or friends with hearing issues to observe, you have this sub and people, like me, willing to help.

2. Start carrying around hearing protection (e.g. plugs) and use it liberally.

3. HA technology, like most technology, improves over time. So, as hearing gets worse, HAs can mostly keep up. Make sure you're prepared (financially) to get new HAs every 3-5 years. Save up and/or get a medical plan that helps pay for HAs.

4. Someone else mentioned sign language. This is a good ""back up"" plan in case things get really bad. I'm not to this point even after ""many years"".

5. You will likely start using closed captions to watch TV. Annoying at first, but very helpful. Fortunately, movie theaters also support CC.

6. It's helpful to have a job that includes video calls, as most video-conferencing software includes CC. There's another post in this sub about good jobs for people with hearing impairment.

7. Jump on illnesses like sinus infections. There is some evidence suggesting [illnesses can cause hearing loss](https://www.healthyhearing.com/report/53352-Infection-hearing-loss-tinnitus-dizziness-viral-bacterial-ramsay-hunt). I've noticed this myself and immediately start pumping vitamins as soon as I start feeling ill.

8. Be diligent about seeing an audiologist on a recurring basis (annually for me). Your hearing may change. The technology and options will likely change.

9. Get established with a highly-rated audiologist that you're comfortable with. A good audiologist will not only know the multiple, ever-changing options available to address hearing issues, but will be empathetic.",2025-07-27 04:50:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1madnwm/progressive_hearing_loss_looking_for_advice/
1ma7nu4,HearingLoss,New here looking for some input,"Not looking for medical advice but maybe just some input/thoughts/ideas

I’m a 36 yo male. I’ve listened to loud music, concerts, played in rock bands without adequate hearing protection, so I know there’s damage done.

I struggle to hear speech when a person is not facing me, or if they’re in another room. I do also have ADHD, and struggle to hear conversations with people close by me in crowded areas like restaurants, events etc; but it seems more hearing related as I can focus on the speaker and am trying to listen but it’s just difficult to hear adequately.

I did have an analysis at an ENT, I attached a portion of my visit summary. I was surprised to hear her tell me hearing aids won’t do me any good. I don’t understand that. Any idea why that may be? I was also disappointed that she really didn’t have any alternatives or advice other than getting checked again in a year or two.

So, anyone have any idea why hearing aids wouldn’t benefit me? Or advice on how I might be able to improve symptoms at all? Obviously I could stand to stop doing damage, but not sure that will improve current state.

Thank you for any thoughts or insight!

1ma32pb,HearingLoss,Abnormal Tympanogram in Both Ears,"My son is 18 months old and recently saw an audiologist for testing due to a speech delay. This is his tympanogram. The audiologist mentioned there was abnormal middle ear function in both ears, but didn’t explain much beyond that. His audiogram results were good for one ear before he became fussy and couldn’t complete the rest of the test. I experience muffled hearing myself (but not complete hearing loss), and I’m wondering if that might be similar to what he’s experiencing based on these results. Could someone help explain what this might mean? I’d really appreciate any insight. He has also not had any colds or allergies that could have affected the test results. Thank you in advance!

his ear drum moved a little bit less than normal in response to a puff of air, sometimes i see this with kids sometimes and often it means nothing. Were OAEs performed? it is a good sign that one ear’s audio was normal (as both ears were abnormal to the same extent for the middle ear).

if you are worried, ask tor ABR (they will likely use anesthesia though since babies cant lay still). my understanding is his tymps are shallow but still type A which is normal and OAEs were all normal which means no sensorineural hearing loss. at most he may have a slight conductive issue but unlikely due to the clean shape of the tymp",2025-07-26 20:12:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ma32pb/abnormal_tympanogram_in_both_ears/

1m9vj3p,HearingLoss,Coming back to hearing aids after a long time,"After wearing my hearing aids faithfully daily for about 3 years, I was interrupted from wearing them for a couple of months due to some life events.  Since then, I have gotten out of the habit of wearing them.  It’s been months and months.   I want to start wearing them again, but am having trouble adapting back again.   I have to get my brain to re-adapt to the loudness of the sound, and everything feels sharp and hard.    Plus the in-ear aids feel uncomfortable in my ears, as I’m not used to them.  My ears feel really itchy and waxy at the same time, and it makes me not want to wear them.  I can barely make it through a half day without yanking them out and enjoying the numb peaceful dulled sound.

Any tips on getting myself back into the hearing aids? I know there is a benefit, and remember the benefits but it’s so hard to adapt back.

1m9s79f,HearingLoss,"Muffled hearing, ear pressure and I can’t pop my ears.","I (19M) have been experiencing muffled hearing and pain for over 4 years now. My hearing would get gradually worse, and every ENT I went to said that my Tympanometry came back normal and that the pressure in my ears was also normal. I’ve also done a CT scan to check for fluids behind my ear drum, which resulted in no fluids, and have also done balloon dilation surgery with no results. 

I have this bubble popping sensation and loud noise (from the air bubble pop) in both ears that flairs up either randomly or when I yawn/blow my nose. I’m unable to clearly hear people talk, and I’m also unable to go underwater without immediate pain. The way to describe my symptoms is as if you are ascending in an airplane and don’t pop your ears.

After going to many doctors and trying every nasal spray and drug out there, I’ve decided to see if it was TMJ. I was given a night guard and assigned physical therapy twice a week in order to see if anything would improve. As of the end of week 3, I have seen no results.

I do also have forward head posture, which could be the cause of this, but I’m not entirely sure and are truly lost in finding the right diagnosis. If anybody here could point me in the right direction in what I could possibly have, I’d be more than grateful.

you have a mild hearing loss overall. normal speaking volume is 65db, your loss is above that. with a mild loss like yours, hearing aids would likely not help and would actually make it harder

Yeah, is nothing. Your right ear is better than your left ear. Not by much but you can tell.  You have a serious dip in both ears at 8Khz which makes me think you are pretty old (over 40) or you damaged your hearing with loud noise. the good part is all the frequencies are equal. Be happy! Th bad part is the damaged high frequencies are gone for good. Is nothing you can do. You can always pray to God but so what? If is a loss (and it is) is a uniform one and this doesn't make you feel weird. You don't have huge dips and so on.

I would get a second opinion. This doesn’t look noise-induced; there’s no 4k notch, which is typically seen in NIHL. You’ve also got mild-to-moderate loss in one ear and mild-to-severe in the other. That asymmetry would raise red flags for me and should absolutely be evaluated further. This needs a thorough workup, not assumptions.

I am a Doctor. And have tinnitus. The dip you see is because of masking effects of tinnitus which is at the same frequency. Start taking anti oxidants and vitamin b12 supplements. Given it is acute I suspect Hyperbaric oxygen might help. Also take a short course of high dose oral steroids.

I have my consultation for Oxygen therapy for my SHHL/Cochlea Hydrops. I have a few questions in mind and thought to ask you guys if you had any general ones which i can ask on your behalf.

What i have noted to ask:

○ Risks involved? Possible side effects?

○ In my case as one of the persisting symptom was ear pressure, which now has calmed, would this be a good idea?

○ I am claustrophobic so how can it be made easier for me.

○ Statistically how soon should it be started from onset of SHHL? 

○ Approximately how many sessions would be required?



If you guys think any more or diff questions should be beneficial, whether for my case or yours, do let me know.


Thanks &amp; Regards 🌸

I took hydroxizine which is a very gentle anti anxiety med to help with claustrophobia. I just kept telling myself that 2 hours in a chamber was nothing compared to regaining my hearing. 

My sound sensitivity really ramped up during my treatment. Nobody knew if it was related. All that calmed down once I finished. I did 9 sessions in total and called it because they were concerned about the sound sensitivity for me. In retrospect, sound sensitivity can be attributed to stress…… so I think that was more likely the root cause.

I started Hbot for my SHHL yesterday. 4 weeks after symptoms onset. Tried steroids both oral and injections with no improvement.  So Hbot is last hope. I completed my first session with no issue then this morning had a complete panic attack 45 minutes into the treatment and they had to end the session. Suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe then started overthinking things and mind thought the worst.  They were able to get me out and now have been prescribed xanax.  I go back Friday for my 3rd treatment. Hoping I can make it the entire 90 minutes at pressure bc I have 18 more visits to go.

For sudden hearing loss should be covered by insurance and you will be going to a medical clinic or the hospital which is regulated and you should be very safe. I want a wellness center that specializes in hyperbaric oxygen therapy and the claustrophobia is real first time I try to do hyperbaric therapy I left. The next day I came back with my wife she put some essential oils on me I believe adaptive by doTERRA was one that she used for me and it causes calms the vagus nerve.",2025-07-25 04:30:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1m8pv93/hyperbaric_oxygen_therapy_questions/

If you can't go to an ER, i would suggest going and making an appointment online with a walk-in clinic. Try to be very clear on what is going on with your ears. Either way, if you are not taking seriously in one place, try another, and DON'T Stop till you are seen by someone. Depending on were you live it could either be a long or short journey getting medical care that you need.

Did u already had T or just started after this episode?


In any case don't wait and assume, go to ER. At worst, they wl turn u away but that's very unlikely. You will get some sort of direction and then can decide further.

well as long you don't have hearing loss is all good. insist on them so they take you seriously. you said: I can tell I've lost some frequencies. how? By listening to music?  Did you tried Mimi app? Is a sound testing app and while not perfect (and works better with some specific headphones like the top of the range Sony which I have, Apple, Beats, Skullfcandy. Bose, and Nothing Ear - by the way very nice brand name for something you put in your ear: Nothing Ear.. Nothing coming in your ear - you are deaf). If you have an iPhone (and not a joke of Android) you can Synch Mimi app with your Health app and it will draw you also an audiogram. Take it with with a pitch of salt, I hope you have salt in your house as we speak. Also the values can difffer by much compared with professional settings. In my case up to 30dB. So how cand I trust it? Well is just helping you to make an idea. Specially good if you are watching over an evolution (or involution) of the hearing with time. Don't be strong and in good spirit. Usually those problems are very grave. I'm in this crap since 7 March 2025 and ...well long story you know? Till you make it to the clinic just use Mimi app and please tell me what's what.

I was blowing my nose and using saline sprays. Felt like some sort of fluid was rattling in my left year when I blew my nose once.

Thought nothing of it but the next morning (now day 7) my hearing in that ear became muffled.

It sounds a bit funny, almost like an echo at times in noisy environments. Definitely feel pressure in the ear, some popping, and I’d say what it feels like 10-20% hearing loss to me.

It’s now day 7, throat is feeling much better but the ear is about the same and doesn’t feel like it’s getting any better.

Went to an ENT doctor and I’ll be honest, they scared me and sounded alarmist. They believe it’s Sudden Hearing Loss and I need to start on 20 mg of steroids right away and not wait and to go get an MRI.
No fluid or sign of infection that they can tell.
I’m otherwise healthy and in my 30s.

Used AI on that one, when I first got diagnosed. I've been using magnesium, Omega 3 and PEA. Because in my case, those had a high change of being low in my blood and it made sense to supplement them. You could also use curcumine and some other stuff that's known to be anti-inflamatory. Seeing most of ear stuff has to do with inflammation. 

The magnesium seems to help a lot, with the stress associated with some of the symptoms, so I personally find that one the most useful.

hi there.
my hearing loss progressed from moderate, April 2024, to profound in May 2025. no speech recognition and hearing aid doesn't help at this point. so I just got my implant two days ago. 
I got diagnosed with autoimune inner ear disease, currently happening in my left ear. although the right one seemed to get downhill also, with steroids I managed to keep it under control.

Mines genetic and progressive high frequency, though all of my frequencies have dropped since childhood hood ; it’s been steady, about 20 dbl, in 27 years BUT we don’t know when the drop happened, all at once vs over time ect, my hearing has gotten worse over the last 5-6 years so we are thinking around then , but no way to tell. My solo parent didn’t take me for hearing tests once he found out I was loosing it; I don’t know why but it didn’t give me an accurate way to measure my loss, I’m in hearing aids now and will have to go in annually,

1. Don't believe ENT. 

2. They try to sell a lot of hearing aid and cochlear implants.

3. There is no way he/she can tell is a genetic condition. Just a supposition, so going deaf in the future is again a supposition. 

4. 20dB loss is in normal range. Normal audio range is between 0 and 20dB.

5. If let's say you have an extra 20dB loss over what's considered normal (let's say 40dB loss, right?) is still moderate. 

6. Keep in mind cochlear implants are one way only. you lose the hearing in that ear, because they stick you an electrode in the cochlea and is making mashed cochlea. keep in mind the sound you'll hear (in case you hear, because there are a lot of cases of cochlear implants that don't work, they don't know why but people don't hear) is not like you real hearing. has nothing to do with the ""hearing"". people who went deaf (not born deaf) described the sensation terrible, robotic, lack of pitch, you can't listen well to music, low resolution sound is like switching from listening music through a hi fi system to a phone speaker. Avoid at all costs.

7. Don't panic, the medicine is still in Middle Ages when is about hearing and many other things.

I lost partially my hearing 6 months ago. The literature says if you don't recover with steroids in few weeks then you can't recover anymore, yet I made huge progresses even months after the event.

1m6qseb,HearingLoss,Audiogram Results,"I am a 38 year old female. When I was 24, I went suddenly deaf in my right ear. I was three months postpartum and at first I thought it was just a sinus infection and that my ears were clogged. But after a few days of poor hearing It finally went completely deaf. I heard a pop and then nothing in my right ear. I saw an ENT within a couple days and they gave me a steroid injection in my eardrum. Along with a course of oral steroids and antivirals. My hearing came back to what the ENT categorized as a serviceable hearing loss. It was weird at first and took me a while to get used to but eventually my ears and or brain did adapt. Fast forward to a few days ago when I had a similar feeling to what happened 14 years ago with the sudden hearing loss. I woke up in my right ear felt very full and sounded like somebody had a microphone right next to my ear ringing with feedback. My hearing seem worse than even what it already was and the ringing slash echoing sensation was definitely new. I went to urgent care to rule out fluid on my ear drum or any debris. She did not see any fluid or wax in the otoscope. I have not been sick nor have I been swimming or done anything that would have caused this. I saw the audiologist today and these are the results that I got. When they did the tympanic pressure test my right ear barely reacted or I guess not at all. She made sure the probe was in the correct place and did the test several times. My left ear was fine. Does anybody have any thoughts about what might be happening? Or any experiences you've had. I see the ENT on Thursday or one of his nurse practitioners rather and will be following up. I am aggravated that I didn't keep my hearing test from all those years ago showing where my hearing was after it recovered somewhat. But then again I've been OK for the most part and never had the feeling that I need to go back to the ENT until now. Thank you for any input you can provide

Sorry to hear that. I've been (and I still am) in the same situation (less the post partum thing cuz I'm a man) You have some serious loss at 1khz in your right ear. The left ear is far from ideal. But the right is terrible. Also you lack the eardrum reflex on the right side. :( Means that your ear drum is not reacting to a loud noise. Could mean also a conductive problem or just could mean nothing. you need to take a MRI and angiogram CT to rule out tumor (I doubt since you had problems before) and vascular issues (which may be a cause). It is fluctuating or is stable? the tinnitus you have is because you had a sudden hearing loss. till your brain will adapt you going to hear more weird noises. Don't need eardrum injections. oral steroids have the same efficiency. no need to torture yourself. your ent must give you steroids asap. :( I'm sorry ... i know how you feel and i imagine how you are hearing since my audiogram had also huge dips like yours and was nightmare on the elm street.",2025-07-22 21:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1m6qseb/audiogram_results/

1m6k8yk,HearingLoss,Almost one year.,"I have been trying to make this post for nearly a year. Let's start at the most painful part of it all.

I'm 33 years old, almost 34, And this time last year, I began to lose my hearing, By October last year, I became completely Deaf.

There is no rhyme or reason, for it. None. Growing up, and now looking back, SO much of my childhood has come into perspective. There are times where I would get upset over something someone said, and well, I would be told that they said something else. I had someone tell me that there where monsters in the basement, but again, looking back, I think they really said 'there are no monsters in the basement'

It really messed up my childhood, and i never thought about it as strange, I never thought about how odd it was that my hearing would just go out, ringing in my ears, pressure building up, and Pop! I could hear again. I had, also, Other shit to deal with. Like Scoliosis, wearing a back brace for more than 20 hours a day, from 7, till I had my surgery as 14. So, yea, I had other things to deal with.

After that, I kinda forgot about the little episodes with my hearing, I was in high school, catching up on work I missed after my 1st surgery, than, after I lost both of my Grandfathers almost 4 months apart from each other. After that, I had my second Spinal fusion at 18, when I had a Growth spurt. I was, a VERY late bloomer, But, I was never at a weight that was steady. I was 82 pounds \*I'm 4 feet 7 Inches For context\* in 2010, I have NOT Gained the weight back easily, but I am close to 80 pounds once again, in 2025.

So going Deaf. I don't think about it. I don't ignore the fact it happened. How can I? I can't hear my mom sing, I can't hear the cat meow, I can't FUCKING Hear my brother yell at the computer when he dies in his games! It sucks, I can't put it into words, how much it sucks, And I love music, always have, always will. I'm living that stupid philosophical question. Would you rather be Blind, Or Deaf. Well, I have my answer. I always knew what it would be.

Music without sound is poetry. Give me the words to read and I'll be good. Sure, I'll miss out on new songs, but, I'm holding on.

  
The good news is, I'm eligible for the Cochlear Implant.

hiya! sounds like you had a rough time generally speaking. 
from the hearing loss perspective, I can say that I just had the surgery for implant yesterday.  and I'm looking forward to having it activated and be able to listen! I'm deaf in my left ear, what about you? is it both?

I'm from Belgium and I've got an ear nerve infection, that doesn't seem to be healing. 
I've got an MRI planned for tomorrow, my specialist made the appointment about 2 months ago. Had to wait 3,5 months at the local hospital, but they managed to get a spot in an other hospital about 15 miles from where I live. 

I personally thought that I had to wait for a long time, but 6 months is kinda crazy to me (and 5 years ridiculously crazy). 

I don't understand why you guys have to wait for so long. Couldn't you have gone to a different state or something similar?

Or maybe rich people with good insurance, get handled quicker?",2025-07-22 17:24:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1m6k8yk/almost_one_year/
1m6clq1,HearingLoss,Wierd feedback when listening through one earbud.,"Hey reddit,

I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar to this or have any idea of the cause.

In my early 20s I was diagnosed with tinnitus and mild hearing loss in my right ear and 10 years on its about the same.

I spoke to the specialist about this last yr and she was just really confused and didnt understand what I was trying to explain to her. 

When I wear only on earbud in my right ear I get a wierd feedback in my left ear. It isn't a high pitch but more of a deep thumping feeling. But it's so annoying that i cant even hear the talking from the podcast playing in my right ear. The thumping sound appears at the exact moment the talking comes in.  Like a beat, it matches it in the opposite ear.

When I listen from the left side only, there are no issues. When I listen with both in, it's fine. It's purely only when I listen to the right side which has more hearing loss.

Anyone experience this or know what it is?

Ik heb hier geen ervaring mee, wel een vraag hoe je een post kan maken?

Gr. Albert

Yes is know the feelings. I lost part of my hearing in the right ear. Actually is fluctuating right now. Hope it may recover and I noticed the same thing. Hearing with the better left ear weird sounds from using a single headphone in my right (bad ear). If you ask me is a form of transcraniation. Is an effect. What your nerve in the bad ear cannot be perceived anymore is partially perceived by the good ear. Sound waves are traveling through your skull to the “better” ear. I can’t find another explanation. How you are coping? I’m very depressed.",2025-07-22 12:21:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1m6clq1/wierd_feedback_when_listening_through_one_earbud/
1m6ayoj,HearingLoss,"Undiagnosed hearing loss, my specialist doesn’t seem to know what is going on","I am 30 years old female, I noticed I have hearing loss in my right ear during Covid when I noticed that I have to turn my head to listen to zoom calls. I did a hearing test and indeed I had severe loss in my right ear but my left is normal. I was given hearing aid to cross over sound from right to left, but didn’t feel the need to use them that much. I did occasionally because this would diminish speech recognition in my right ear. I was okay with this because my left ear made me normal. Last year, I woke up suddenly with my head feeling like I’m underwater. I panicked, I couldn’t hear anything. I went to the ER and was prescribed steroids for a week. My hearing almost came back but not as good. Ever since then it’s been fluctuating! It’s a nightmare, I don’t know what I’ll wake up with. The hearing aids don’t help on bad ear days, it’s just white noise. MRI was normal, ct scan normal, mri with colours looking for highdrops normal. Blood test for genetic and autoimmune normal. The doctor recommended cochlear implants for my bad ear. But I am hesitant, especially with no diagnosis. What if this is reversible? I don’t need hearing aid on my good ear days, I can almost rely on my good ear. This has been fluctuating for a year. 
PS: I used to have bulimia, and I mentioned this to my doctor.

I have something similar. Unilateral sshl in right ear. Looking at CROS but considering CI

hiya. kind of similar story here also. 35F, sudden hearing loss in left ear, last year. from moderate it progressed to profound already and hearing device didn't help anymore. this year I finally received the diagnosis of autoimune inner ear disease, although all tests came back clear in 2024. 
hearing fluctuated, was on steroids couple of time but in the end decided to go with the implant. I just had the surgery yesterday. it was just way too tiring for me to be living with only one functioning ear.

1m67vk6,HearingLoss,Advice PLEASE!,"Guys, I’m 18 yr old (M)… 8 months ago, while I was showering my left year sudden started paining, not a mild pain but a serious one. So as soon as I got out of shower I informed my dad about this and also told him that there was blood coming out of my ear. 2 days later we visited the doctor and she examined my ears, told us that I have a hole in my ear. Later she gave me medicines and some kind of ear drops, the name of the drops was otobiotic. Then we had a scan and showed it to her… she said surgery might be necessary if the ear doesn’t heal itself. We gave it time,2 months and then went to doc again. This time she said it might’ve healed but surgery is still good for the future… my father told her that we will consider it after my exams…. Fast forward to now… yesterday we visited the doc again and this time she said that there is some kind of a rut, a small rut in my ear (like some kind of pothole). We again went to get my ears scanned and also gave a hearing test
They said the normal hearing should be near 15-20db but my eight year is 36db and my left one is 75db!. I was soo shocked and sad. Like my future plans all flashed in front of me, but I stayed silent there. Got to home and cried like a bitch. My father is upset too. Now we are proceeding to the surgery. They said after surgery they might bring my left year to 45db from 75db and my right year to 26db from 36db but that might not be permanent if I don’t heal properly and all that. For context i am a fat 85KG 5’7feet 18 year old male and I HATE THIS! 😔 💔. I swear to god that I’ll work on my body after this surgery and make sure that I’ll eat enough proteins and good food to make this surgery successful permanently. 



My question is, guys, can I somehow bring it down to 20db, for both my ears? I know I sound like a mad man but I believe today’s advancements in medical research will make this possible. Doctors are saying I might need hearing aids for the rest of my life but I don’t want that. I want to have a normal hearing. Like will meditation help? Will eating good foods help?
Please guys help me on this. 🙏 
Edit:- the doctor also said there’s some kind of ear infection in the left ear. Also guys the left ear’s been verryyyyy mildly paining ever since that doctor shoved a camera/flashlight into my ear

Praying for you bro stem cell in China heard good things

Im a little younger than you im 16 and i lost my hearing when i was 15 from sudden hearing loss in my right ear which is I think different from your case. I hope you recover, it’s honestly horrible to lose something like this at our age. I know there’s people who lose it at 2 years old too and that’s also sad. I hope in the future there’s a cure for these conditions.

1m5ym2g,HearingLoss,Hidden hearing loss is rare and hell (M20),"Hi M20 here ive been suffering with this stuff for months now. Im on the spectrum so if you don't understand these are just a list of things that has happened after the loss and my summary on having Hidden hearing loss and tinitus.

1. You can't hear your own voice and it's sounds like you're hearing yourself in 2nd person. The deep vibrations that thickens your voice and brings confidence and main character soul is just gone. Now I sound like a nerd an this is what I allways sounded like it seems(i sound like my voicemails in person lol) no wonder people replied to me that way over the years I didn't think it was that high pitch. 

2.Everything now today in the 20s is music and ""just feel the vibe bro"" while needing constant background music: but for me now it sounds like pure ufiltered shit no pun intended. I can't feel the classic Bass and drums dancing on my right ear witch I allways picked up and loved. And everything hurts my cheek for more then 30 min, this is why i hate driving with people(i loved the radio and music pre HHL and had it allways on now i drive without music to work and for sport), ppl i know have to shove music down your thoughts but you try to calmly tell them you have a rare type of hearing loss; Nevertheless they blast it all on vol 15- 24, never ever driving drunk pll agian agian. But now it's ALL sounds like a Mono mix and loses all immersion, fascination and imagination, and my ear &amp; head hurts. 

3. You're ears simply have less quality: depends on witch nerve fibers you lose but even one or many like me has reduced my quality of life. I felt about 7 times it disconnected and you never want to hear it. If I could describe it, imagine a young woman screaming her lungs out building up inside your ear for a split second or two. And you feel numb for a few seconds then the next day you can't feel certain, sensations, sounds or reactivity and It's not just a usual Monday. 
Hearing loss is unbearable, close up You still think people say other things, And you need to look at their months and words have no added feel. You just have to nod and smile while humming, montion and balancing issues happen daily. Gaming is hard to enjoy, now i get why most oldies don't game. I do a little bit on tv or speakers but its really rough. Music is gone from my life sad to say. I was like everyone else, soundless headphones, but yeah its just feels uncomfortable or gutful now. I collect music still, and guitar pedals and gear. But now i get why the lottery and patience is key for seniors, there is nothing to do. It's a little bit exciting.

4. Static tinitus: this is a very personalized tinitus since all tinitus are personalized from what I've read. But you don't Ears don't heal. And you regret that day that caused that noise trauma. And you wish you could just wake up since you can't comprehend the matter of fact of the situation. 

5. ENT - Audiologist find nothing: you go to the clinc and they do test and see both physically and pitch snd speech tests and you score high yet somethings is wrong, you feel it in your gut and you know you can't hear it. and they tell you are a perfectly healthy young blond blue eyed boy and its impossible for 5 sec of a loud feedback noise exposure to damage your ears. 3 - 6 months and then your ears will gain full reactivity! duh. They didn't send any files or documents to my mainline doc and i called them 5 times for saying its unnecessary, this is on friday. I am going to a new ENT and Audiologist two counties away on august. to get hearing aids or atleast a proper diagnosis. My grandmother had the same thing strangely enough, nerve fibers died and she was in a simmilar dizzy state to me now according to my dad.

6. Depressed during summer and really unstable post tinitus and hearing loss: you lose a lot of identity and take really small neesh things for granted, it's really hard to explain but you sort of can't just sit and do gaming and play music in the background on headphones like 80% genz i know do. That my chill time after work. I felt so much better and did way much stuff. Driving allways felt like exploring and cruising. I do the same things half esque, but the element of feeling that silence of places and soul was all in my head. Being depressed in the Summer is really awful. I been just been driving to mask it. 100km back and forth helps me. But that cherry on top of life and quality is gone for good. I have had very dark thoughts since i have no social life after school(just snap freinds but they never invite me) or large family gatherings. This was really easily to mask, ignore and cope pre tinitus. Going to the goverment mental health soon since they haven't reached out in 4 months. 

7. Research and Development of Hearing loss and Tinitus releated stuff is really underfunded and seems like it's not been anything big in the past 30 years, like if a billionaire suddenly had it they would be so much faster solutions and resolutions done. It's really sad to see that there is not even a simmilar working ibuprofen or ointment, electro-therapy, nanobots or a cosylan for tinitus has been invented since that would sell millions of units. This is an open sea of actual opportunities, my guess is that is impossible to access the inner ear would damaging it or we havent found regenration tech just yet. Like how come? 

Anyways thank you all. It's been really rough and I just thought I wanted go share. This is a battle I need to be pushing thought and a mistake I will regret for the rest of my life. Thank you all. Peace

They are pretty similar

there is a 5 to 10db margin of error

Also these are two different ears. X and o are left and right

I'd say bite the bullet and get the aids. You want to stimulate your brain to hear the sound it's missing.

Umm, pretty incomplete test, where’s the bone conduction and speech scores? Need to understand your speech intelligibility scores and then see what you need.

Trial a pair. Don't put any money down until you know if you'll perceive a benefit or not. Both audiologists are correct. You're in a gray area about whether or not they'd be a use to you.

The left one looks like hell. also, the right one. she needs hearing aids.

She def needs them. Can she hear you?

The most sensitive hearing frequency range of a person: 500 Hz ~ 4,000 Hz
The right side is basically in the range of mild hearing loss at 500Hz-2kHz, and moderate hearing loss at 2-4KHz.
The left side is basically in the range of mild hearing loss at 750Hz-1.5kHz, and moderate to severe hearing loss at 2-4KHz.
The left side is more serious than right.
For this kind of hearing loss range, directly buying OTC hearing aids can solve a lot of problems, which can basically cover her hearing loss range.
chosgo hearing aids provides OTC hearing aids, including V402R behind-the-ear rechargeable hearing aids and K23\SMARTU Bluetooth hearing aids, which can meet her needs very well.",2025-07-21 16:32:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1m5nnrs/ive_been_trying_to_convince_my_mother_to_get_a/

[댓글]
&gt;I don't really feel like I need them.

You don't find yourself missing some of what people are saying and asking them to repeat themselves?

My hearing loss is worse than this but my advice is still the same, if you live in the UK and can get the on the NHS, get them whether you feel you need them or not as often we don’t realise just how much we can’t hear because we become so used to it. If you would have to pay for them then you need to weight up the pros and cons of having hearing aids to see if it would be worth how much it would cost.

my opinion is if you dont notice your hearing loss, you can wait. this is a mostly mild hearing loss focused in high frequencies. many people at this level dont notice hearing loss because conventional levels are around 65db. i think the main issue with mild loss is hearing in background noise, which hearing aids unfortunately do not help with

Get the hearing aids
Wear them every day

You will not love it.  People dont ""love"" exercising, taking vitamins, eating right, being patient, driving the speed limit....

But, ffs, you NEED to.

The neurological damage caused by untreated hearing loss is very well documented. 

Don't be dumb and full of regret.

Yo, my white brother, let me tell you one thing. First of all, that audiogram looks bad. Is not terrible but blasting and ""enjoying"" music should not be a thing anymore for you. You lost mainly high frequencies, so has to do with aging or you blasted your ears. Usually is consdered deafeness when you loose in 3 frequencies or more. 3 frequencies meaning 3 in a row from the standard 125,250,500,1000,2000,4000,8000 Hz international bullshit. You have a dip at 4Khz, that could mean noise induced hearing loss also, You should take care of your hearing. The future looks dim.

I was born with a moderate to severe hearing loss. Growing up I used to sit next to the speaker to feel the vibrations from music.

Years before I had SSNHL (in both ears) I used to DJ a lot. My friend and I got hired to DJ a housewarming party and we realized right away that about half the party goers were deaf. We were concerned at first that maybe it was weird to have us DJ'ing but they were the first on the dance floor and were there all night. A couple of them regularly would put their hands on the PA for extra vibrations. It was such a wonderful time, such a fun party!

Evelyn Glennie is a deaf percussionist :https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Glennie

I have moderate to profound hearing loss and will continue to blast music until I leave this mortal plain!  It’s such an important part of my life. I know it can contribute to worsening hearing loss, but it’s far too important to me to give up.

u/Drew_Conley1295 I completely understand what you mean, I also enjoy music when it's ""loud"", not too loud though. But the most important advise I want to give you is to watch out with the time you listen to loud music for. As the time you are exposed to loud music is what makes the difference. And yes, we want to enjoy music, but you want to continue to enjoy life as well, so be careful you don't lose your hearing in your right ear, you will want to hear your grandson/daughter's voice one day, believe me.",2025-07-20 23:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1m53woe/hearing_impairment_doesnt_stop_me_from_enjoying/

1m40r9c,HearingLoss,What’s Causing the Popping/Clicking in My Ear?,"Hello All,

I (26M) experienced sudden sensorineural hearing loss towards the end of 2023 that resulted in near complete hearing loss of my right ear, even after treatment was promptly and extensively exercised. A few weeks after the hearing loss, I began to develop a popping and clicking sound/sensation in the bad ear. The click sound is that of a keyboard or typewriter and the pop sound is similar to a suction cup being undone. These sounds are very much physical and I can feel them happen. The presence of these symptoms were all over the place and nothing seemed to trigger it. I would hear rapid popping/clicking every few minutes that would last 30 seconds or I would hear an intermittent click every 10 seconds throughout the whole day. Occasionally, I wouldn’t hear any of these sounds for a few days. There has always been general pressure and aching in this ear as well since the hearing loss. Each of the pop sounds are always accompanied by a buildup in pressure. I also experience headaches on the right side of my head too. Anyways, while it was quite the nuisance, I was able to manage with it.

At the end 2024, I underwent a surgery for a cochlear implant, which exacerbated the popping/clicking sounds to the extreme. I was up for three days after the surgery at one point because these symptoms were so persistent and intense. As expected, the symptoms improved in the coming weeks and months as the fluid and swelling from the surgery went down. However, the popping/clicking still has been way more present than what it was prior to the surgery and I often only get a few hours of sleep each night. I’m also starting to struggle with my schoolwork as it’s been difficult to stay focused. I was prescribed Ambien and Valium (not taken together) to assist with sleep, which has been somewhat helpful. I should also add that my symptoms do not change whether my cochlear implant processor is connected or not.

My ENT suspected the issue to be either middle ear myoclonus or palatal myoclonus. After not observing any spasming at the palate, we pursued the MEM route. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, Botox in the middle ear, and eventually a tenotomy of the stapedius and tensor tympany muscles were all unsuccessful. I was at a loss at this point and feeling very discouraged.

With the possibility of MEM out of the equation since those muscles are no longer connected to the middle ear bones, I worked with my ENT to see if we can diagnose this as eustachian tube dysfunction and possibly look in to palatal myoclonus again. After watching my palate for hours in the mirror across multiple days, there’s doesn’t seem to be an obvious spasming of the palate that correlates to the popping/clicking, but I have seen a handful of random subtle palate twitches. Nevertheless, this doesn’t necessarily seem to be an obvious case of palatal myoclonus. My ENT is willing to send the referral over for the Botox injection in the palate if I am wanting to pursue that route.

Additionally, my ENT doesn’t believe my symptoms are related to eustachian tube dysfunction. The popping/clicking is not altered/triggered by swallowing, yawning, talking, or chewing. I’m also able to perform the Valsalva maneuver rather effortlessly to pop my ears, but this doesn’t impact the other popping/clicking sounds and it only relieves pressure in my ear for a few seconds before it builds up again. I have been taking Flonase and Azelastine for a few weeks now too, which hasn’t made a difference. My ENT also stated the puncture in the eardrum from the prior Botox injection should’ve relieved the pressure and popping/clicking symptoms while the puncture remained open if this were to actually be related to ETD.

At this point, I’m unsure how to proceed with next steps or what those might even look like. I just started taking Clonazepam to also assist with sleeping as I have gained a bit of tolerance with the Valium. I am ready for this to be over as it’s taken quite the toll on my life. Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you

I had this for years in one ear. Sometimes worse, sometimes better, sometimes on and off, sometimes  continuously for long periods.

It depends on the stove and the hearing aids. With mine its a little crackling but usually the boiling water, extractor and so on are louder. If the cookware fits the stove theres also less scattering.

If there’s an “acclimation” feature on the hearing aids, make sure it’s turned on. It’ll gradually turn up the volume over two weeks (at least my latest pair did).

Plan times to take them on/off. Louder sounds are overwhelming and fatiguing. Especially for sensorineural hearing loss where there are fewer hair cells to process noises.

Hi! My daughter was also born with hearing loss and is now 10 months old. She has been wearing hearing aids since she was 6 months old!

We have found a lot of success with headbands and pilot cap. She goes to daycare so we also wanted something that doubled as a solution to prevent the hearing aids from getting lost.

We use taupe tape to tape the hearing aid into the headband. This way, even if she pulls the hearing aid off, she pulls the entire headband off with it and it is super obvious if she is chewing on them. If she manages to take the headband off entirely, it is much easier to spot a headband on the floor with the hearing aids taped in than a rouge hearing aid.

If she is pulling on them constantly and the daycare doesn’t have the bandwidth to monitor/keep putting the hearings aids back in, the daycare will put her pilot cap on (keeping the headband on too). 

I can’t speak to toddlers but I asked the daycare if the other kids in her class pull at them and they said no! 

I am happy to say that at this point, my daughter has “learned” to leave the hearings aids alone and really only pulls them off if she is tired. It took about 3 months of wear before I noticed a difference in behavior! But I can’t even remember the last time the daycare needed to put her pilot cap on since she leaves them alone now!

Hi! I’m 18 now but was born with hearing loss. When I was a baby I would take them out and eat them. Sadly that’s gonna happen no matter what, but it’s helpful to have that headband attached so she won’t be able to swollow it. You do have to keep watch though. But getting  hearing aids when I was very young really improved my life so it it absolutely worth it.

Sometimes yes, particularly if I'm tired or stressed. Or been in a very noisy environment where I've been working hard to hear for a long time. Other times no. Hyperacusis for me has lessened since I got a hearing aid and haven't been struggling as much

Yes. Its so much more effort to deal with tinnitus/hyperacusis and makes my brain exhausted. Maybe its the stress of it as well (3 months in here only)

Sometimes.

In November of last year, I was diagnosed with a 40 dB hearing loss in my left ear. On June 6 of this year, a very similar drop was detected in my right ear. I believe neither of these losses were sudden, but rather gradual, since I didn’t notice them except for the tinnitus that started bothering me.

I'm afraid it might keep progressing since they couldn’t tell me the cause (I suspect it might be something vascular because I also have pulsatile tinnitus). Does anyone here have this level of hearing loss?

This looks very typical of noise induced hearing loss. I would get a second opinion and start wearing protection in noisy environments.

I have the same audiogram. Mine was cause by noise induced

Very indicative of noise exposure but can be Harley genetic as mine is.  Just pretty rare to have high frequency loss from the gjb2 gene! I think it’s considered moderate loss in your audiogram, as mentioned I’d start using ear protection,!

you have a mild low frequency loss in the right ear. it looks like your high frequencies, while primarily normal/mild to begin with, have improved to great thresholds

Yeah, just like me my friend you have some loss. It means You lost quite a lot in the bass frequencies (even if the audiogram doesn't go very low), you lost across the specter 15dB. I was an audio-engineer and believe me, in the world of ""sound"" 15dB is quite a lot. Yeah long story short your hearing got wrose since your previous audiogram on 9th July. The good news is you gained 10dB at 6khz and 20dB at 8Khz,which agian is not bad! Usually damage in the upper registry, is forever. Well I fight a fluctuating heaering loss just like you since 7 March 2025. I lost tons of dB then, 4 rounds of steroids, I had better days, at one point almost recovered 100% but somehow I was having like ""attacks"" of hearing loss and tinitus and I was back in square one. If you ask me is all about luck. Not the steroids, not vitamins, or whatever, is pure luck. You either go deaf, partially or god 4 bid, worse. Next move you should take a MRI to see what's what.

You should be fine. If you hearing doesn't return (it may be possible) then welcome to thy new world. I bet the sound pressure from thy phone wasn't enough to cause you harm. Even if let's say harm happened, I have some bad news, they can't heal hearing, even is caused by sound exposure or whatever.

But as I said, my money is on your hearing returning to full spectrum.

27M, healthy and generally fit, working kinda stressful job, minor allergy to pollen, never had ear problems before.

Left ear only affected.

Since 10 weeks I have fluctuating low frequency hearing loss and tinnitus unilaterally in my left ear, fluctuating down on average once a week but recovering then slowly over the next 4-5 days. So on some days its as low as 30-35dbhl at 250hz sloping (quite steeply) upwards to normal at 1000hz. At 2-3 times it was also around 30dbhl at 500hz but usually the 500hz frequency is at around 15dbhl. And then some days it has recovered completely to 5-10 dbhl at 250hz with all other frequencies being normal. This cycle happened around 8-9 times in the last 10 weeks. The tinnitus, which is more like a humming 150hz-400hz sound, correlates strongly with the degree of hearing loss.

No clue what it is or what causes it and I could not identify any triggers. Already on 48mg betahistine since 4 weeks, 240mg Ginko Bilboa since 8 weeks, and a bunch of vitamins of the JOH regimen. Only change is maybe a bit of a reduction in the frequency of these cycles and feeling of fullness in the ear.

Had MRI incl contrast that was fully clear even including (!) special Hydrops-Protocol, but they did not find any sings of cochlear or vestibular Hydrops… So now the ENT again said it could be a problem with the “ventilation” of the eustachian tube but idk if thats plausible…",2025-07-16 23:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1m1rmyz/fluctuating_hearing_loss_and_tinnitus_but_no/

Excuse my bot-like typing manner, I am a  neurodivergent person.

I (M17) have been to a music festival five days ago. Six and seven hours of pretty much constant exposure to 100-120 dB music over the span of two days. I was standing pretty close to the stage all the time, and I wasn't wearing earplugs.

For the last three days, I didn't notice hearing loss nor tinnitus. I've also stayed away from loud noise/music as much as I could. My ears are completely clean from earwax. I've never had any hearing issues before, too.

My hearing has been completely fine in both ears until a few hours ago (I'm not sure when exactly did the problem occur). Now everything is a bit muffled in my right ear (no tinnitus). It still works normally and I'm able to hear people talk and whisper from my right side, but my hearing is imbalanced to the left when the sound source is in front of me. The imbalance is also noticeable while wearing headphones.

I've been trying to identify the problem and I'm leaning towards temporary threshold shift, although isn't it weird for it to kick in so late? Is there anything I'm overlooking?

how difficult of an adjustment are cochlear implants and what sort of lifestyle changes would I have to expect when I eventually get them? (my audiologist told me that i have another 5 to 10 years at best with hearing aids due to the rate of my hearing loss thus far) 

I have been wearing hearing aids since I was 3 years old and my hearing loss is severe to profound and its bilateral sensorinueral my average word recognition as of my last test was 93 percent. I can provide a picture of an audiogram if it would help in any fashion.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me. I have a mild-moderate high frequency hearing loss. The hearing aids were great for a bit, but recently, they sound awful. Speech clarity is poor, and sometimes when people laugh, the sound crackles and they sound electronic and robotic, and when cars pass, it sounds echoey. And I can’t wear them when I’m driving the car because it’s too distracting and it seems like the sound is not natural. My audiologist ordered a new pair to check if it’s a manufacturing issue and the same problem is persisting. 

Does anyone have any advice, or maybe could recommend a different pair?

The hearing aids definitely help in really quiet situations, but my hearing seems to be worse with hearing aids in busy situations and it’s making it more obvious that I have poor hearing, and I feel like I’m almost better without them.

Why do I have ear fullness after acoustic trauma? And how come they don’t give steroids in Sweden? They seem to do it in other countries after acoustic trauma. Feel very difficult to adjust to ears feeling full. Have not have hearing tested after last acoustic trauma. I think you could help a lot of people in the tinnitus forum aswell. Tack! Hoppas du har en fin sommar 🙂

My questions are:


- when your ear pressure, tinnitue is in effect, does that not affect your hearing tests results? 


- can the test confirm tinnitus or ear pressure issue? If so what on my report confirms that.


- i feel now when the water is on or tv is on i would have trouble hearing what someone else is saying or speaking to me.


- it's so odd because before ear wax removal i didn't feel issue with my hearing.

This might be way too late to expect a response, but is it possible for a child to experience non-progressive hearing loss between birth and 4 years old due to a natural cause? I only ask because my son was diagnosed at 4 with hearing loss despite passing a newborn hearing screen, and we found out that it has not gotten worse since his initial diagnosis. We suspect that it may have something to do with one of the two sets of ear tubes he’s had inserted (or a really bad ear infection he had that required shots to treat) because it was determined that it’s not genetic in nature. So it’s hard to know what his prognosis is when we don’t know where it came from

How often have you encountered reverse-slope (low-frequency) hearing loss?

What's the best hearing aids you recommend ?

Hey! I have a question; I found out I was hoh as a child but my lone parent didn’t do anything about it; about 27 years later I found out and just got my first pair of hearing aids, 

Now the question, almost every dbl has fallen and gotten worse but low frequencies still in normal (JUST) higher frequencies are moderate loss and moderately severe on the other ear, each dbl basically has dropped between 10-25 dbl, Is this significant over 27 years and if you had an educated guess on how it’ll progress in the next bit? I feel like it got significantly worse over the last 5 years or so,

How can I know it's the setting the audiologist tat didn't set the zetting properly as usually most of them will say it's my brain but as I'm long time user fm, I regonise it is the setting they did not set it right 

I just wish I can understand what to do with the setting n set it myself n rather than to hear hearing is bad need cochlear but if it is bad I won't be able to hear well right now

Also as a audiologist I would like to ask what's ur input in regards this: most loss of hearing is due to inflamation n they need to get ride of that inflamation in order to hear well

1lzokm5,HearingLoss,I got diagnosed with SSNHL at 17 and I am facing a dilemma,"I (17m) just suddenly started to notice deterioration in my left ear’s hearing last Wednesday and thought it would disappear after a good nights sleep, then the next day I woke up unable to hear anything from my left ear other than a consistent white noise.

I talked to my parents about it and they said the ear was probably just blocked by water or smth and that we should just book an appointment to a family doctor on Sunday, which is what we did.

I went out with friends and to a party like everything is fine since I thought this was no big deal.

Fast forward to the family doctor, he said nothing looks wrong with my ear which is when I started to really worry and search online what could the cause be, and after some tests with chat GPT I came to the conclusion I probably have SSNHL and told my parents we just go to the hospital today, then after 4 hours of waiting and getting nothing out of the doctors we went home and returned the day after, (today) and then we got the diagnosis of severe SSNHL in the left ear and I got prescribed Prednisone for 2 weeks (60mg first week and then less as time goes on).

Now this was very surprising to me and tbh I don’t know how to feel about it, I have a vacation with friends outside the country (in Spain) next week and tbh idk if I should come. We planned to go on several parties and do loud stuff on the vacation but tbh I don’t think I should go at the moment. Any suggestions? How do you think it will affect the chances of recovery?

I came on Reddit looking for similar posts! I just got put on prednisolone today. I have just taken x12 5mg pills for my first dose. On Saturday I woke up with tinnitus in my left ear, when I get this it usually wears off within a few hours but Sunday comes around and I can barely hear anything. Today I decided to go see a doctor, I assumed just wax build up but weirdly.. my bad ear is absolutely squeaky clean, no sign of infection and zero wax but my good ear has lots of wax 🤣 .. Doctor went away and made phone call to the hospital and they suggested taking steroids first for process of elimination then at the end of my 12 day course of meds I will be going to the hospital for more tests to pin point why I have the sudden hearing loss! 😖😖😖 praying the steroids work!

hey!

1lzeum7,HearingLoss,CHOSGO Idea: What If Your Glasses Were Also Hearing Aids? Would You Wear Them?,"

[댓글]
I don’t want it.

The two things provide different functions, I replace glasses and hearing aids at different times and with different frequency, and I need the most advanced hearing aids available for my severe level of hearing loss.

I consider hearing aids and glasses separate to actually be the more convenient option, both in how I use them day to day, and for long term viability and replacement.

I remember having to send hearing aids for repair.  I could live with that for a couple of weeks, but not if I also couldn’t see in the meantime.

For a long time, I stopped listening to music. But this changed with wireless streaming and a good audiologist.

1ly8pvd,HearingLoss,Cannot hear people well. Is this serious?,"Hi everyone! I just wanted to ask whether I got TTTS or if it's something else. Also I'd like to know if this is serious or if it'll go away according to your experiences. Thank you!

I went to a concert last year (April, 2024) and everything went fine, I didn't feel that something was wrong at the moment. But the next day I started feeling something off in my left ear. I felt pressure there, and also my sound sensitivity changed.

From that moment on I feel less tolerance to sounds coming from my phone for example. Also, I have to ask people to repeat themselves on some occasions, in noisy places or even if they talk quietly but there's no noise around. It feels as if I cannot concentrate well when hearing people.

Other symptoms I've got are jaw pain, on my masseter muscle, specially on my left side and I've got trigger points on my temples. There are some uncomfortable noises when I voluntarily wiggle my ears. I also feel trigger points on my neck and headaches on my forefront which could be due to my poor posture (I work in an office). Moreover, my bite feels odd and my Eustachian tubes feel less functional as I think I have to yawn more to open them.

I've been to the hospital and got an audiogram test. My hearing should be fine except at my 8000 hz frequency in my right ear, in which my threshold is at 25 dB (it's a slope from 5 dB at 4k to 25 dB at 8 hz). Apart from that, other frequencies look fine.

I was told that the slight difference at 8 kHz in my right ear is almost normal among people my age (28 years old), as we've been exposed to music, nightclubs, etc. And I was told that slight slope would go unnoticeable and should prevent further damage especially as I age. 

Anyway, I've also been to a dentist as well and I've been wearing a mouth guard at night since I have bruxism. But I still have that pressure on my left ear that is really uncomfortable!

Do you have any ideas about what this could be? I'm looking forward to read your stories. Thanks!

1lxxn5m,HearingLoss,Hears a weird story about my hearing loss.,"So I've got a shrunken ear canal in my right ear so as a result it's making it harder for the fluid to come out of it then it should be. My parents told me when they went to get me tested at the time as a kid they said it was an incurable thing. What theyve been doing though was making sure both my ears were cleaned out everyday and they believe its what caused me to go from not speaking verbally to being able to speak verbally. So I feel like I need a bone conductive hearing aid or something similar to that because certain earbuds I have are able to play music loud enough in my right ear to where I can hear words and stuff. 

https://a.co/d/hd1pkH8
I do have normal headphones but those aren't able to work on my right ear like these earbuds which is why I'm believing I need a bone conductive hearing aid. And if I push my right earbud in a bit it does sound more clear for some reason.

1lxnvzb,HearingLoss,SSNHL in right ear.  Fearful it will occur in my left ear.,"Last October (2024), I came down with sudden laryngitis—total voice loss for about 10 days, but no other symptoms. I felt totally fine otherwise. Then, on October 26, I woke up with a clogged/full feeling in my right ear. Two days later, I woke up profoundly deaf in that ear.

I saw an ENT immediately and started a prednisone taper. I regained *some* hearing, but it’s still significantly impaired. I have constant tinnitus and high-frequency loss that makes noisy environments incredibly tough. I’ve been doing my best to adjust.

After finally accepting “this might be permanent,” I was fitted for a BiCros on July 1 and am scheduled to get it on July 16. I had been feeling a little more hopeful.

But now… it’s happening again.

I’ve had laryngitis for the past three days. No fever, no congestion—just sudden, complete voice loss *again*. I am absolutely panicking that I might lose the hearing in my **good** ear, or that the little bit of hearing I recovered in my bad ear could get worse.

For context: I’m a nurse practitioner. I live a healthy lifestyle—exercise, clean diet, no smoking or drinking. I do have systemic lupus, and my joints started aching again a couple weeks ago. I already had an appointment set with my doctor, and after calling today in fear, he started me on another prednisone taper + Z-Pack just to be proactive.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Sudden voice loss tied to hearing changes? Has anyone had a repeat scare and it *not* end in more hearing loss? I’ll take honest responses, good or bad — I’m just feeling incredibly anxious and alone right now.

I don’t know if this is helpful but I asked my ENT the chances of SSNHL happening to my other ear and he said “about the same chances of it happening to you the first time” - which I assume are pretty low.  I’m not sure about the link to laryngitis to SSNHL  though.

There is a very low chance. Very few people ever get it and even few in both ears. I have had it twice in six years in the same ear. Have been diagnosed with cochlear hydrops since then, a form of Menier’s disease. The situation with Menier’s is the same, rarely in both ears. Your ear that was affected by the virus was the one susceptible to it, not your good ear.

1lxfzy9,HearingLoss,Complex high freq threshold shift case: suggestions for steroid treatment,"I am a musician and recording engineer and working with sound is my entire life. I'm in my 20s.

Late June I suffered an auditory injury (120dB for 15mins, 5 of which were protected) and developed muffled hearing, mild tinnitus, pain in ears, hyperacusis. Normal audiogram up to 8kHz. ENT prescribed a short course of oral steroids (6 days + 5 day taper). I also had the flu prior to the injury and so was sick.

At day 3 started the oral prednisone.

At day 5 received a dex injection in left ear. At day 10 received a dex injection in right ear.

At day 10 (so on the second day of my taper) developed severe, unrelenting muffled hearing in my left ear that felt like being on a plane.

At day 13, I take the last of my prednisone.

At day 14, normal high frequency audiogram, normal otoscopy, normal tympanogram. Severe muffled hearing in left ear persists - but it's conductive (sounds into my ear canal are unaffected). Right ear feels good.

At day 16, develop high frequency tinnitus out of nowhere. The tinnitus wasn't this bad after the injury. **Second high frequency audiogram shows a NEW notch at the tinnitus frequency**. That steroid course was probably insufficient.

Day 18, found an urgent care doc to refill my prednisone, and she accidentally gave me double my original course. So I have enough for a 12 day course and 10 day taper. All ENTs that can do a dex injection are booked for another week (which would put me at 3 weeks since last injection in left ear). Can't do HBOT because of the severe muffled hearing pointing to eustachian tube dysfunction.

What's my best option for recovering the noise notch at 8-11kHz? It's a mild notch (30dB), but I'm in my 20s, music is my entire world, had perfect hearing before, and I don't want that to become permanent. I've done literally everything I possibly could. This whole time I've also been supplementing high dose NAC, magnesium, vit C, and just started curcumin.

Honestly you are doing everything you can. I have read on Reddit of people shooting off 50 rounds of a rifle with no ear protection losing their hearing in the 60db range but recovering up to 15db with steroid treatment and time. I wouldn’t be surprised if later along the line you recover full hearing. All to say time is the best healer and wish you the best luck. 

Also your life would not be over if you have some hearing loss. I have a notch at about that frequency, I’m about your age and honestly the tinnitus is mild compared to a lot of people on here. I just take extra care of my ears now and just live my life to the fullest

1lx8zr7,HearingLoss,Help interpreting 4y.o. daughter’s hearing test,"Just learned yesterday that my daughter may have mild neural hearing loss. She has failed two previous hearing tests but each time we were told it was likely due to fluid in ears and/or swollen adenoids. Yesterday, however, the audiologist said there was no fluid present and so it’s likely a nerve issue. I don’t know how to read these results and we don’t have our follow up with the ENT until next week. Can someone give me an idea of how severe her hearing loss is? Does this chart indicate what sounds/tones are more difficult for her? Would this level of loss warrant hearing aids? This is all new to me - no family history of hearing loss.

1lwzm8e,HearingLoss,How bad is my SHL? Can i have hope for recovery?,"Just out of nowhere, or so i think, I am experiencing Tinnitus. On saturday i fasted and after breaking my fast and praying came to sit watch tv and eat my dinner and bam the noises start coming. I am claustrophobic as well as ocd and gad and i just can’t manage stress. I panicked, shut down mentally. I started putting olive oil in my ears as per pharmacist advice, i woke up with impacted hearing which later resolved.

I had my ear cleared yesterday nd was hoping it would resolve the noises but they are still there, esp noticed when its quieter. I also experienced popping after cleaning but i assumed that’s normal and wl settle. My ear also feel kinda heavy or full but not severe. I am panicking what if these noises don’t resolve. Reading up online def is not helping my anxiety. I am really very triggered.

Had hearing test done today which marks mild reverse sensorineural hearing loss, report attached. I am at ER right now and just can't stop crying.

I already have GAD and other mental health conditions and this is getting too much for me. Don't know how much longer I will be here for but they also don't have ENTs on duty. So staff is saying u wl be referred. Reading online is overwhelming, some say there is no reversals while some say corticosteroids can help if administered during initial days. However I think they wl probably need more tests done before they possibly administer it so I am panicking more.

Before the test, the audiologist seemed sure it was a nerve/neck issue. She said since the ringing in your ear subsides and warm compress is helping, it is most likely nothing major. However the test results for that ear did not come out well. I have mild sensorineural hearing loss.

What I don't understand is if we currently have ears ringing, feeling full and blocked, does that not automatically causes hearing to be impacted? My outer ear and ear drum and pressure were fine on test.

Went to ER and got prescribed Valacyclovir Hcl 500 mg 2x3 times a day for a week AND Prednisone 60 mg for 10 days. They have also sent referral to Otolaryngologist.

Its not too bad at all. Get on txt and cros your fingers. People have it much worse than that - even if you don't recover any hearing at this level of loss, you'll be totally fine and adjust.

I wonder why ent doc never suggest steroid injection to me

Tinnitus usually gets worse, if your stressed. Try to relax and ignore the tinnitus as much as possible (I know this is very hard to do, but you should try none the less) Use masking sounds, to fade out the tinnitus. Depending on what frequency your tinnitus is, you'll need a different masking sound. For some people it's crickits, others it's the sound of water flowing and other stuff like that. There's YouTube videos you can use, just type in ""tinnitus masking sound"" and try some of them. It usually takes a while, before you find a masking sound that works, but if you keep at it, your bound to find a masking sound that matches your frequency. For me personally, low frequency Tibetan singing bowls often do the trick. 

Good luck and please, try to relax

Not bad at all, you’ll adjust fine over time. Also loss like this more like to recover than someone who had severe or profound, so you have that going for you but either way you’ll be good.

You just gotta do what doctors tell you, and hope for the best. The audiogram itself is mild hearing loss.

If sudden tinnitus bothers you, that's understandable. I hesitate to say that, but it will never go away, and do NOT read my latest post, a poem I recently posted in r deaf, about my hearing loss.

Life doesn't stop here. If my ""trusts experts and hope""  messaging falls a little flat to you, who repeatedly talked about praying, remember that God lets things happen for a reason. If I did not lose my hearing, I'd not be able to recover my brain after my 40 ft fall. Thinking about it, maybe do read my post. Find positives.

The left ear has mild hearing loss, and the right ear has mild to moderate hearing loss. If timely intervention is given, the hearing loss will not get worse.

Do steroids for sure. Your loss is not horrible. You have a great chance of getting more back. Go to an ENT. Get the shots and oral steroids.

Bump!

1lwbz9t,HearingLoss,Seeking feedback from people with hearing loss about hearing in noise,"Hi everyone,

I'm part of a research team at Edinburgh Napier University.

We're trying to solve a problem I'm sure many of you know all too well: the 'cocktail party problem'. That feeling of being in a busy restaurant or at a family gathering and just being totally overwhelmed by noise, making it impossible to follow a single conversation. It's mentally exhausting.

Our team is developing a new type of hearing aid tech that uses a different approach to filter out that background noise and focus on the person you're talking to.

To make sure we're building something that actually helps, we need to hear from people with real-world experience. That's where you come in. We've put together a short, anonymous survey that takes about 2-3 minutes to complete.

**Survey Link:** [https://research.typeform.com/to/CLI9VCEo](https://research.typeform.com/to/CLI9VCEo)

Your feedback is seriously invaluable and will directly help us figure out what matters most. No personal data is collected, it's completely voluntary, and it would be a huge help to our project.

Thanks for reading and for your time.

We’ve noticed it’s been getting worse over the last year, but he always brushes it off and says he’s “fine.”

He doesn’t want to get hearing aids because he thinks they’re big, obvious, and for “old people.” I just want him to be able to enjoy conversations again without missing half of what’s said. Has anyone else dealt with this and found a solution that doesn’t make them feel self-conscious?

Would really appreciate any advice.

[댓글]
Does he have to ask people to repeat themselves a lot? Does he misunderstand a lot? If so, ask him how he thinks people think about hom ( old and too stubborn to do something to help himself). Do you know anyone with HAs he could talk to? Because most of the time people don't even notice them. He probably thinks of HAs as they were a generation ago and may not even realize when people are wearing modern ones.

Yes!! My MIL is so hard of hearing now and just won't address it. I wear a hearing aid so I'm literally there normalising it and making it 'not just for old people'. Drives me flipping nuts every time we are talking and she looks aghast and confused because she has totally misheard.

My FIL never brings his glasses with him so can't read anything that isn't arms length.

I have several health problems and if there was some kind of treatment for any of them on offer you'd better believe I'd be doing it. Can't understand sitting there slightly deaf/blind and not addressing it, but clearly struggling.
Edit to add: sorry no actual advice, just empathy!

This is very normal as people age. 

Admitting would mean having to admit their physical health is worsening, therefore they're getting older. Which is scary and vulnerable.

Hearing aids are a physical reminder of that and make it even more tangible.

My only recommendation is talking about it calmly, expressing worry and care. Not pushing for it. Asking what your dad is worried about. Showing him examples of how aids looks and reassuring him it is not a weakness

Yes, and it is so frustrating. I’m under 50 and already wear hearing aids due to genetic early hearing loss. My own parents and their partners will NOT address their terrible hearing. They won’t even listen to me! It’s honestly annoying. Boomer parents are a force.

When my mother finally did the first set didn’t work that well.  The ones she has now work really well but she won’t wear them unless she’ll be with more than a few people that day.  They’re uncomfortable. Even so they’ve made a world of difference for her.

my advice is dont force it. im late deaf and if someone tried to force me to wear hearing devices, id be miserable. focus on making communication more accessible on your end

My mother was the same way until she realized how tiny they’ve gotten in recent years. You wouldn’t know she has them unless you look really closely.

Get them dim AirPods 2. Let them figure it out

You could have your dad try Concha Labs, they were built by people like us with hearing loss actually. Super comfortable and you can barely see them. It does take self-confidence so be patient. Wearing them around does help with realizing that others don’t actually really care. If anything, wearing my hearing aids have allowed me to hear and respond seamlessly and naturally, and also even inspired others to take that step to hear clearly. Remind your dad why he is awesome. I hope your dad is able to get there!

My mom has profound hearing loss and has been wearing HA for over a decade, both her parents and two older siblings also experienced late in life loss that got progressively worse. All of them voluntarily wore aids.

I am the youngest in my family to get HAs at about 33yo. My dad's hearing started declining in his late 60s. He knows damn well how helpful they are, how discreet they are, how much the technology has improved in the short time since my mom got her first pair. All of it.


He refuses to admit it is now at the point he needs HAs. BUT he did make the choice (without anyone suggesting it) to get the latest AirPods. He's had Apple products for years and feels confident using their OS, so the tech is familiar and pairs seamlessly with his phone, watch, and computer. He LOVES them. He still refuses to get HAs and knows they exceed airpods in enhancing hearing to a huge extent. 

I've repeatedly heard that airport are a 'gateway drug' to HAs. So our hope is he's on the road to caving and getting some.

Unfortunately we all default to using a higher volume and clarity, better dictionary, and not talking over each other when we speak to my mom, so he *thinks* he can hear just fine when we all get together, because we're automatically doing it for her benefit and it also happens to benefit him too.

I think part of the reason he's in denial is that he's ALWAYS used hearing protection when doing activities where it's loud. I think his pride won't let him admit that despite that, his hearing is declining.

He also refuses to accommodate my mom. They no longer watch TV or movies together because he hates closed captioning, he's irritable when she asks him to repeat himself, and has no patience when she pauses a conversations to put her 'ears' back in. She takes hearing breaks regularly when at home and is not as tech savvy so often struggles getting them connected quickly. He also won't wear the collar mic she gives my younger nephew so she can hear him. It's no suprise he refuses to admit he is starting to need the same things.

So it's just a waiting game until he decides he's ready.

So. For your parent it could be a reluctance to depend on technology he won't understand at first. It could be how he saw deaf people treated when he was a kid (not well). It could be he doesn't want to admit to a weakness in his ability to function independently. He may think he won't be allowed to drive anymore (he will). Hearing aids used to be huge and bulky, he may not believe they've gotten so small and discreet. He may suspect they'll just amplify EVERYTHING, when in reality it's just noises in the dB range he has loss in. They ARE expensive, but hearing tests are not. Costco offers them for free to members.

Whoever is closest to him can try to slowly get further answers to why he's so reluctant to do anything. Get him high tech earpods have a feature that amplifies sounds around him as a gift if you think he'd be willing to use something like that. Pitch the other features the hardest. Then wait. He'll either eventually get fed up trying to have conversations or will stubbornly continue living in a world he can't fully participate in. He's an adult and you can't force a choice like this on him.

I have in the last year been told I need hearing aids and the audiograms prove it.  There's all this information to encourage. you to get them, and some pressure as well.  So I recently paid $2000 for a pair of hardly noticeable aids. I do not work and am seldom around a lot of people. Most of time, I hear the things I need to hear:  salespeople, health personnel, bankers, servers, etc.  And I live alone so no one has to repeat themselves. 

My experience was that they were indeed uncomfortable - my ears itched a lot, and I frequently forgot to  put hem in.  I finally decided that they were not adding $2000 worth of value to my life and returned them.  In fact, one day I entered my sister's home while wearing the aids and she had the TV on and then tried to have a conversation with me, and the level of noise between the two  was very disturbing.

I notice you say that ""you want him to be able to enjoy conversations again"".  That is your wish , not necessarily his.

1lw7376,HearingLoss,One issue I keep having. Suspected hidden hearing loss,"(M20) I have had two months of static tinitus since May and after a noise traumatic scream hit me in the face from an small amp. For like only 5 seconds. and I really don't understand but I ENT said I had no hearing loss from the Pitch test and speech in voice. I been dealing with Cold nerves on my ear and everything from that to muffled. But most of its gone.

The main problem i have now is that my ear does not physically react to sounds anymore, like clapping, cutlery or simply flicking a lighter. I used to be a music lover now I can't listen too it without my nerves getting numb on my cheeks. And its with everything like that. My left hear hear just fine but i still main my right ear even if there is not any loss finds yet. But when i wake up if can feel a hard cropping of where it used to be and where my other ear rests, its really uncomfortable.

I going to see a specialist in my capital to see if it's possible to find anything first. But I'm pretty sure there is something that's gone.

Apparently it is a loss of cochlear synapses. The same thing happened to me, although my cause was ototoxic medications that stayed in the auditory nerves, which made me hear fewer sounds at once and a sensation of having liquid in the ear. I am still the same even though it has been 100 days since the hearing loss.",2025-07-10 08:01:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lw7376/one_issue_i_keep_having_suspected_hidden_hearing/
1lw5qtf,HearingLoss,Reoccuring hearing loss?,"Hi everyone,

Just looking to see if anyone has experienced similar things as me and has any tips or wants to share their story.

Right now, i have a very hard time hearing a lot of minor things in conversations in groups or when acoustics are not good. I definitely feel a lot of tinnitus at times. It has been like this for a month now and i would be dead-scared. 

The only thing is, this happens to me continually. I have periods of weeks and months where my hearing is just completely blown out only for it to get back to a seemingly normal level. The hearing loss reoccurs after nights of loud environments, even though i'm wearing ear-plugs.

I have tried multiple ear-doctors and one of them said i had a little damage at one frequency in one ear, but generally seemed in the normal area, and that i should just get hearing aids if i was unsatisfied. The other said i could clearly distinguish between words/noises and that my hearing was statistically normal and that he thought my experience was due to psychic factors.

Personally i feel like it might just be the tinnitus getting worse for a while and then settling? Just seems so insane to go around for months feeling deaf, and then suddenly my ears are ""rested"", only for me to go to a wedding or whatever and get my hearing trashed again. 

Does anyone else experience anything similar?

Looking forward to hearing about it.

If this loss of hearing is occurring specifically after being in loud environments, chances are, the ear-plugs you're currently utilizing are not effectively protecting your ears. As a result, you continuously experience Temporary Threshold Shift/TTS; your cochlea's hair cells have been disrupted and need time to reposition themselves. Experiencing tinnitus afterwards would absolutely be expected in a scenario like this. TTS can last a few hours to a few weeks, depending on what caused it.

While hearing will generally recover after TTS, repeatedly putting yourself in these environments and not giving your ears adequate time to ""readjust"" those hair cells will absolutely lead you down the path of developing noise-induced hearing loss. You're going to need to do some independent research on safe listening practices and make sure you're purchasing proper ear protection fit for whatever concert/wedding/loud environment you're going to be in.",2025-07-10 06:31:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lw5qtf/reoccuring_hearing_loss/
1lvuf8g,HearingLoss,Numb Ears,"Hello! Just to clarify I have already discussed this with my audiologist and neurologist and they aren't really too concerned about it, it's not getting worse and I don't have an infection or anything. I'm looking to see if anyone has experienced anything similar because my case and reason behind my hearing loss is very uncommon. My hearing loss is due to nerve damage and seizures, a side effect is numbness in my ears. I was wondering if anyone else experienced this aswell. Either with ssnhl or anything else. How do u cope with the numbness?? It feels so weird and is overwhelming even after 8 months of it, I haven't gotten used to this numb feeling my ears have. 
Looking for tips on getting used to it, or coping if anyone has any at all.. 

Thank you!! Xx

1lvthvl,HearingLoss,Dad's advanced hearing issues. Need help!,"Hello,  
  
My Dad has significant hearing impairment in both ears. We got him hearing aids from Costco, after undergoing the tests. Though it is slightly better than the earlier hearing aids that he  had, it is still super hard for him to hear. He recently had a stroke which paralyzed his right side. I believe it has worsened his hearing issues.   
   
Are there any special hearing aids that can help advanced levels of hearing issues? Alternatively can cochlear implants work in such cases? Is there anything else that we can do to address his hearing issues?

1lvq3zq,HearingLoss,Hearing loss after a head injury,"I wonder if anyone can help. I had an incident at work where a child with special needs hit my head and I immediately heard ringing in my right ear. The ringing continued for a few hours and then I had other symptoms such as dizziness, headaches and fatigue. I went to A&amp;E and they cleared me on the neurological side and sent me for a CT scan which was all normal.

The ringing has been on and off since and it feels like a pressure build up in one ear, almost like being underwater. ENT saw me today (a week after the incident), and have said I have mild hearing loss in both ears, but more so in my right ear and I will need a hearing aid.

The doctor couldn't tell me specifically if the hearing loss was from the head injury. I need to know what to do regarding work. The tinnitus seems to be since the injury, but will the hearing loss be? Is it possible it's an issue with my brain rather than my ear? They tested my ears and are giving me a hearing aid so surely it's not linked to my brain, so can it be from the injury?

Any help at all would be appreciated! Thank you

1lvodo9,HearingLoss,Living with Hearing Loss: How One Man Regained Safety and Connection Thanks to an Innovative Wearable Device,"Hi everyone,

I want to share a story about Man Flame, a 35-year-old who faced life-changing hearing loss after a severe accident. Everyday sounds  like a simple knock on the door or a nighttime alert became nearly impossible to hear, affecting his safety and independence.

To tackle this, we created **Sonarity**, a wearable device designed specifically to help people with hearing impairments detect important sounds and even understand emotions behind speech.

This video shows Man Flame’s journey one month after using Sonarity, highlighting how this device has brought him greater awareness, security, and a stronger connection with those around him.

1lvn286,HearingLoss,I can't feel sounds physically anymore on my right ear. ENT and Audiologist find No hearing loss. Suspect hidden hearing loss.,"I (m20) am 2 months inn after noise trauma from a combo amp feedback on my right ear on 8th May. I suffer now with static neural and ear tinitus, nerve issues on my right cheek, and roaring and tinitus witch flickers and goes away. And I now suspect the reason is hidden hearing loss or auditory prossessing issues.

 If could explain it in simple terms it feels like a barrier in my ear just whent away, so listening to songs is Hell. But I can hear everything just not feel it. Might be my nerves or HHS. 

I can bearly do my job since I require hearing mufflers and listening to my t all day. I been taking NAC, Multivitamin,Mag and Magnesium glyserol witch does not really do much anymore to be honest

Week 2. I visited the ENT, I asked and stated my issues, they said you need to take it quiet and let it heal for 3 -6 months. I had 40 min so it felt rushed, ENT check and examined it 5 times, Audiologist gave me speech and pitch witch was S tier. I asked them for steroids prehaps but they said it did not fit inn.

post trauma had nothing but nerves witch hurt my right ear and cheek if heard from a specific angle.I had a more loud tinitus and muffled hearing witch whent away after week two, i sometime had my right ear hi pitch screaming if any sounds came, like tv or anything at all witch whent away but im uncertian what that was.

But nothing more improvement after week 6. but week 8 my right ear is still there but I can't feel my deep voice but I can have physical reactions on my nerves from my cheeks that builds up witch is unbearable and its the worse. 

Simple things like clapping, cutlery, lighters does not show up or gets any reactions witch they allways did before. Everyone has summer break witch they deserve so but after that's over, I'm going to my doctor and ENT for the second time to get a diagnosis or check inn.

I'd expect a simple ""pop"" and it Came back to life but now it looks really grim and i can't talke pride and joy in simple things anymore since it hurts me like hell and i had so many plans for this summer.
 I just drive for hours now and just try to do things to mask it. But my family and friends are seeing me decline in real Time is just sad. What im most afraid of missing out on things or getting dementia. Like i don't know what to do.
I just guess i must carry on.

1lv6ssm,HearingLoss,So apparently there was some news drop about a successful hearing loss treatment,"This is what I saw :

https://www.facebook.com/share/1Dpmjgozzw/?mibextid=wwXIfr

https://www.facebook.com/share/1FdJwxXnoW/?mibextid=wwXIfr

I fact checked it with ChatGPT and this is what it said for link 1:

Yep, this is the real deal—and it’s huge news. Here’s everything verified:

⸻

🎯 What Actually Happened
	1.	Karolinska Institutet-led Study:
	•	A small clinical trial (10 participants, ages 1 to ~24) in China used a single injection of AAV-based gene therapy targeting OTOF, the gene responsible for producing otoferlin – a key protein in transmitting sound signals  ￼.
	•	Delivered via the round window into the cochlea, this treatment started showing results as soon as one month after the injection  ￼. At six months, all participants had significant hearing gains, as average hearing levels improved from ~106 dB to ~52 dB  ￼.
	2.	Best Responses in Young Kids:
	•	Kids aged 5–8 showed the strongest improvement. One 7-year-old girl regained nearly full hearing and was able to hold daily conversations just four months post-treatment  ￼ ￼.
	3.	Safety Profile:
	•	No serious adverse events were seen during 6–12 months of follow-up. The most common side effect was a temporary dip in neutrophils (a type of white blood cell)  ￼.
	4.	Broader Implications:
	•	This is the first trial showing such gene therapy benefits in teenagers and adults, not just young children  ￼.
	•	Researchers say “OTOF is just the beginning” and are already exploring similar approaches for other genetic deafness genes like GJB2 and TMC1, based on promising animal data  ￼.

⸻

✅ Verdict: It’s Legit

The news is thoroughly confirmed by multiple reputable scientific outlets and press releases—from Karolinska and collaborative journals like Nature Medicine to ScienceDaily, Neuroscience News, The Independent, and GenEng News ().

⸻

🗣️ What Comes Next
	•	Larger, long-term trials: To assess sustained efficacy and safety across more diverse age groups and genetic backgrounds.
	•	Future targets: Expanding gene therapies for other key hearing-loss genes (e.g., GJB2, TMC1).
	•	Ultimate goal: Make gene-based reversal of genetic deafness widely accessible, going beyond hearing aids and implants.

⸻

TL;DR
	•	✅ Real and confirmed: Single-injection OTOF gene therapy showing rapid hearing restoration.
	•	👂 Kids responded best, but teens/adults benefited too.
	•	🚫 No serious side effects reported in early follow-up.
	•	🧬 Next steps include broader trials and more gene targets.




Link 2 it says: ✅ That’s the same verified study — just summarized in a different post. It’s all legit.

This second link you gave is basically a short write-up of the Karolinska Institutet study published in Nature Medicine, which involved:
	•	🧬 10 patients (ages 1–24) with OTOF gene mutations (causing congenital deafness or severe hearing impairment).
	•	🩺 Received a single injection of an AAV vector carrying a healthy copy of OTOF gene directly into the cochlea.
	•	🎧 All patients saw hearing improvements over 6 months.
	•	👧 Kids aged 5–8 saw the most dramatic recovery — one 7-year-old girl regained near-full hearing.

Also confirmed:
	•	Most participants began to hear again within 1 month.
	•	No serious side effects. Minor, temporary drop in white blood cells was the most common reaction.

⸻

So both links you posted — even if they came from slightly sensational Facebook shares — are reporting on the same authentic breakthrough. It’s been covered by The Guardian, Nature Medicine, Neuroscience News, and direct press releases from Karolinska Institutet.

This is an amazing achievement, however, it is also one of the easier challenges to tackle with respect to hearing. These individuals have all the ear structures as they should be except for the faulty encryption of the otoferlin protein, which is what they fix with the treatment.

If you're interested in recovering hearing loss, then the challenges are apparently sadly a bit greater.

There are 2 american companies doing otoferlin gene therapy trials too.

A great step forward in hearing loss treatment.

They are not drops. It’s an injection. And it’s only for one type of very specific hearing loss. Im cautiously optimistic for people who are interested in this use case.

1lv4b62,HearingLoss,Sudden slight hearing loss,"About 6 hours ago, I suddenly started experiencing slight hearing loss in my left ear. I made a hearing checkup using tool found on internet, and it seems there is a slight loss particularly around 1.5 kHz. Can’t hear sounds less than 25 dB on that frequency. It feels 1 kHz also affected although the audiogram still shows it is ok while I hear it worse than in other ear. 8KHz slightly below but is was a case all the time for me since I developed tinnitus in 2021 on this frequency. 

Although it’s a mild drop on the audiogram, it feels very disturbing - like my ear is blocked or muffled.

Should I do something urgent? Unfortunately right now I’m on holidays far away from civilization

Most hearing checking tools online are not accurate-- a lot are limited by the quality of headphones. You should get a hearing test by a professional asap if you are concerned.

The only thing to do would be to see a professional. If you’re away from society right now I’m not sure how, but not much you can do on your own.

Wow how did you perceive such a slight loss at one frequency only? I'm amazed.

By the time I whent to sleep that night it sounded like I had permanent foam ear plugs in but the ringing had mostly gone. I woke up with my ears slightly better but everything was still very muffled and did not seem to recover as much as I hoped it would throughout the day. I woke up today seeming slightly better but made this post to see if it might be permanent or if I should just wait it out because my ears are still decently far off what they used to be. Current symptoms are everything sounding pretty muffled and whenever people talk to me there is almost like a distortion or very high pitched buzz. For context I am 15M. Thank you so much.

This is one of those times where Prednisone is something you most certainly should ask for at A+E or ER. Even better an ENT. 

Don't let them fob you off. Tell them what happened and tell them you need Prednisone. You need to give yourself every chance to get better. The longer you wait the less chance of Prednisone working. 

I don't wanna scare you. You just need to know this is an urgent situation.

I recently went to the audiologist on July 3rd.

I’d get a second opinion, ten minutes doesn’t seem like that long, I was in min probably half hour doing testing and talking about results

You can test yourself with an app, I think it's almost as reliable and you can take all the time you want. At least that's what I do.

Yes get a second opinion girl. There’s a ton of audiologists out there. I’m not sure what their deal is 😂",2025-07-06 20:46:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ltblm3/bad_experience_with_an_audiologist_do_i_get_a/
1lsxxiv,HearingLoss,Mild Hearing Loss and Hyperacusis,"Hello, 

I am 25F, I have been having ear issues since 2017 and had my first hearing test in 2019 and had my current one this year in February. 
My results have been stable since 2019 (mild 30db hearing loss at 8000hz left ear) but feel like I can’t hear some higher  frequencies and do have trouble with hearing people talk at times and  was said that my hearing is within normal range, but not sure if the blocked Eustachian tube gave inaccurate results.  

I am also experiencing a blocked Eustachian tube, had a ct scan to confirm it as  I was having muffled hearing. Can anything be done for that? I was offered to use nasal steroid spray, which I didn’t use cause I feel like that isn’t a solution.  It been blocked for months although does open and close sometimes. 

I do have trouble thinking clearly and imaging things and I don’t know if that’s related to the blocked eustachian tube or it is entirely something else like stress or anxiety? Has anyone else experienced this? 

Does anyone know  if I can get professional earplugs made with Eustachian tube dysfunction? 

Some sounds I am really sensitive to and my audiologist said it is hyperacusis and there is no cure and for it and I should expose myself to sounds instead of blocking my ears like I usually do. Is this advice right or is something else causing it? 

What have people tried to stop progress of hearing loss other than using protection for loud events. 

I also just learnt recently that we can hear much more than the standard hearing test which makes me nervous cause I don’t know to what extent i can hear. 

Thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice.

I, as opposite, genuinely can’t understand shit of what they’re saying. I’ve never had a problem hearing convos or anything, maybe I’m not used to working at loud environments, but It distresses me how I am not able to understand more than a single word.

I’ve tried multiple earpieces but nothing, their speech is completely unintelligible to me, loud but god knows what the hell has been said. I’m scared my hearing might be in trouble

&gt;Should I go to the doctor

This is honestly always the correct answer when someone posts on Reddit asking for medical advice.

With that said, are you able to try your earpiece and walkie talkie in different environments outside of work? That will at least help you determine whether it's a noisy workplace issue or something else.

Yes you should

Am 20 also, and fighting now for my diplacusis for 1 week, still observing it.

Only way to know is to test. But I will also say that processing speech over radios is a skill and it gets a lot easier over time even if you do have some hearing loss

doesn’t hurt to get your hearing tested. do you have difficulty understanding people in background noise or on the phone? or is this new for you?",2025-07-06 03:20:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lsrfe0/is_my_hearing_cooked_at_20/
1ls7nj0,HearingLoss,Woke up to 100% hearing loss in my left ear,"Woke up on 7/3 with hearing loss and constant ringing . Spent most of the day thinking it was wax or something. By late afternoon I had called an  ENT and have an appointment for Monday. 7/7/25 
I didnt notice until later on the loss is 100% in my left ear. Went to the urgent care. He said the ear is clear. Prescribed drops (My Pharmacy was closed)  and said to call an ENT. Two hours later my wife said I should go to the ER. So I did. I was hoping to get medication. I didnt. They did a CT scan which was normal. ER Doc was super nice. Said to go to a ENT for further testing. There is not much they can do besides the CT scan. I'm trying to get in to the ENT today being they have short hours on a Saturday. I'm scared about waiting till Monday. Hopefully its not too late.


*UPDATE 7/7/2025*
Hearing seems like its at about 70% back. Ringing seems to be off and on. ENT website portal shows no appointment for me at all :( I tried to rebook. It gave me one for 7/8/25 then this morning it shows no appointment. :( Waiting to call them now.  My appointment is for 7/8/25 1pm.

*UPDATE 7/8/2025*
Hearing at near 100% with some ringing. Not constant. 
ENT Visit. 
I did the audio test which they said was not too bad. Dr Stopped the Valacyclovir. I take one more full 60mg dose of  prednisone tomorrow then I start to ween off of it.
I go back next Monday for another audio test. She also said we might do a MRI just to check. I'll see if I can attach the audio test after I scan it.

Small Update. 

So I did Virtual Visit with City MD
The Doctor was great. She kind of made a face with the ear drops the Urgent care doc prescribe. She prescribed me prednisone and one other med. Now I wait for the Pharmacy to call.

Something like this happened to me +20y ago. It was sudden deafness syndrome. Crucially, quick hypobaric chamber treatment combined with medication was what restored it eventually. You need to start treatment within 3 days to increase your chances for ful recovery. 

Make sure you go to a hospital that has a hypobaric chamber, otherwise they will not even consider it.

I LITERALLY just had the exact same experience a month ago. Woke up to 99% hearing loss and ringing in my left ear. It's like I'm reading my own story on here. It took me 3 weeks to get in and see someone and I wish I wouldn't have waited that long. They ended up prescribing me Prednisone like someone else said. However, it has a better chance of success the sooner you take it. (They told me within the first couple of weeks). Just finished my last dose of Prednisone with no progress to my hearing sadly 😢. The ringing sound has slowly turned into a rumbling sound now and hasn't gone away. Feel free to DM me with any questions.

First the CT scan means nothing. If a tumour is suspected like acoustinc neuroma, MRI is the way to go. Don't worry though, is pretty rare. I hope the medication will help you. Do you have any audiogram to share with us?

I'm a tad bit surprised the ER doc did not prescribe prednisone. Search this sub for ""prednisone"" and see if you want to go to a different ER today (or at least see a different doctor). You may need to mention prednisone when you see the doctor.

I'm really sorry, I hope it is something fixable. Don't want until Monday, definitely try to see a professional beforehand.

This is how i lost my hearing on one side 7 years ago. Literally over the span of a few hours. I got to ENT the next morning - put me on a ton of prednisone, did MRIs, etc. Never found any reason for it - they chalk it up to “a virus” and pretty much leave it at that. Incredibly frustrating, but you have to realize that a lot of medicine, and especially when it comes to hearing loss, is just guesswork. 

Anyway they seemed unconcerned, and said it wasn’t uncommon and that 85 percent of people get their hearing back in a few weeks. Seven years later i now have a cochlear implant -which is a lifesaver and totally fantastic even if i wish i never needed it. It’s a long, lonely, isolated road when you’re first dealing with it. I hope you have a better short term result than i did. Feel free to DM.

Why ER doctors couldnt give prednisone? I dont like the fact that they know about SSHL

I wish I know more abt this last 30 years ago n in still trying to look for good doc who can really gave me closure nit promoting cochlear implant

I had this happen a couple of years ago. I was fortunate to get seen by an ENT within a couple of days. The diagnosis was Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss. The standard treatment is a series of three steroid injections in the ear piercing the eardrum. The first injection must be started within 48 hours of the loss, I think. 

I had the injections but my hearing did not improve. Sometimes it just doesn’t work.

Well I have some hearing back this morning. Still have the ringing.
If the TV is on and I block my good ear, I can hear it but not enough to understand whats being said.
Considering On Thursday it was 100% blocked and I could not hear when I scratched the Tragus (I had to look that part up), so its a start.

Hope you get better soon! I am going through the exact same thing it’s kind of spooky lol but same exact thing hearing loss in the left ear and constant ringing I did all the things I could do after two different ENTs mine has not improved it’s been 2 months but I’m staying positive and I’ll send you positive vibes also ❤️

1ls1tqj,HearingLoss,Care During Holiday Weekend?,"Where can I go for emergency hearing care? It's July 4th, a Friday, and as far as I know, all of the ENTs in America are off enjoying their long weekend.

I woke up yesterday morning with pressure and ringing in one ear. Today, after experiencing no improvement, I went to urgent care but I got sent home with Afrin, Flonase, and Zyrtec and they aren't doing any good. My hearing in my left ear seems to be steadily fading, and I'm extremely concerned that I have Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL).

Like many that have posted before me, this is completely unexpected. I'm early 30's, in my prime, never had a thing wrong with my ears and never been sick.

Any tips on getting care before next week?

1lrle23,HearingLoss,Sudden hearing loss. Any odds of recovery?,"Hello.

I first lost hearing in my left ear a year ago. I initially trusted the doctors, but for a long time, steroids were not administered. Over time, I did see some improvement. However, my right ear was the ""good ear"" until March 7, 2025, when I felt a sudden drop in hearing, especially in the bass frequencies. It was the same feeling as a year ago when I lost hearing in my left ear.

This time, I started steroid treatment on my own. I don't advise anyone to do that; I just risked it. Please keep in mind I'm not a doctor. I took 48mg of oral Methylprednisolone for one week, then tapered it off. I saw some improvement, but I developed diplacusis (hearing pitches differently between my ears), and the pitch was wrong, especially below 1 kHz. Frequencies like 250 Hz or 125 Hz just sounded distorted, muddled, and at a higher pitch. Nevertheless, I was feeling better and was somewhat optimistic.

However, my hearing would drop and then rise again from time to time. Every time it dropped, I also took some Methylprednisolone. After a very hopeful audiogram in May 2025, I noticed my hearing in the right ear getting worse and worse. Well, I was already tapering off the steroid, so I stopped taking it because there are serious risks associated with prolonged steroid use.

This most recent drop was different, though; I felt an even worse decline! After a partial recovery, I had another audiogram, and it indeed showed some recovery, but not as significant as the first time I used steroids. On the other hand, this recent recovery was somewhat spontaneous, without any steroid treatment. I know they can still have residual effects after you quit them, but who knows?

Right now, my right ear audiogram shows a medium 36 dB loss. However, my hearing feels much worse due to diplacusis and the fact that I don't hear bass frequencies at all on the right side. I can't even feel the vibration of my own voice. I'm so scared; I'm livid, actually. I barely make it to work, and I hope they don't fire me.

I'm scheduled for an MRI because doctors suspect an acoustic neuroma, but to be fair, I really hope it's not that, as it's quite rare, about 1 in 100,000. The MRI will be done in approximately two months at most from when I'm writing this. The medical system moves so slowly.

Currently, I'm on Betahistine and Pentoxifylline, and I'm also taking some supplements that I hope will help, such as NAC, L-Arginine, B Vitamins, Selenium, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc.

I have a total of seven audiograms, so I started creating tables in Excel to track them. The first one was taken after my left ear recovered a year ago (April 1, 2024), and the last one is from July 3, 2025.

What I've noticed:

* Since April 1, 2024, my left ear has recovered some bass frequencies: 125 Hz by 10 dB, 250 Hz by 15 dB, and 500 Hz by 10 dB more! That's a lot. I wonder how that recovery is possible.
* The bad news: I lost 5 dB at 1 kHz and 20 dB at 8 kHz in my left ear. The other values remained the same.
* I noticed that when my right ear declined, my left ear also went down, but then recovered significantly. The funny thing is that the 125 Hz frequency had the biggest boost: 30 dB! I can really tell the bass is strong in my left ear now. After a year of not hearing bass, it's now an extra 30 dB (a difference between the lowest and highest values recorded in an audiogram).
* My right ear lost an average of 20 dB in the bass frequencies, and I also lost 8 kHz. It went down to 55 dB from only 15 dB, which is a 40 dB drop. I really cannot take it anymore.

The tinnitus is often present and frequently overwhelming. It's worse when I'm standing and gets better when I'm lying down. My hearing also improves when I lie down (not by much, but it's measurable), and the head pressure decreases. I also experience a pressure at the back of my head and stiffness in my neck. I feel like my jugular veins are about to burst. So, yeah. I don't know what to believe anymore.

My question is: Has anyone experienced the same thing?

Also, what are the anecdotal chances of healing? I know that conventional medicine often suggests that what isn't recovered quickly won't be recovered later. On the other hand, I've heard cases where people healed. I'm looking for those people and all kinds of stories. My support in real life is very low. I don't have many friends, and as you with hearing loss may already know, others don't care that much, nor are they empathetic. Somehow, I understand them because it doesn't sound like a big deal. ""Oh, you lost partially your hearing... so what?"" If you don't experience the sensation, you don't know how life-devastating it is. I'm hoping for a miracle because conventional medicine doesn't promise much. Should I try alternative solutions like yoga, acupuncture, etc.? I want to know what the odds are. Searching on the internet, different studies showed no benefits from acupuncture, yet some people reportedly recovered hearing through this method. I really don't know; everything is so confusing. I've had enough.

Thank you for reading this, and I'm waiting for people with similar stories.

Here is a graph with the evolution and involution of my right ear. First audiogram took one year ago in 2024 when my right ear was ok. 11.03.2025 the onset of sudden hearing loss (was my 3th day of steroids), the 28.05.2025 best result yet, 01.07.2025 last one. I have some high frequency losses not seen prior.

Cheers!

Your situation sounds like mine too. I lost my left ear completely, then couple years later later my right ear had another attack, which I recovered that time fully. Couple years later again the right ear but low frequency loses and every weird fluctuating type, where my hearing would go out at random during day or afternoon or night and any low frequency sounds would feel like a buzz or vibration, not a clear sound. Like it was muffled. Also, couldn't hear the sound of my car engine.

It recovered for couple days after then back again, which they suspect was Meniere.

I tried ECochg but it was negative, althought I doubt how efficient it is since it was performed when I recovered my hearing. Thankfully I recovered again.

It's good you take matters in your own hands. I too tried anything remedy I could find, based off of studies or scientific papers.

Doctors have to abide by their books and procedures in their recipe of treaments. They cannot provide you treatments based of latest studies or from international researches, adjunct or alternatives that may work. It's important to ask, beg or demand doctors for prednisone, ear injections, hbot (depends).

I truly believe if I knew about SSNHL better I would have either have partially or fully recovered the hearing on my left er which is deaf.

I would try lemon bioflavonoids, long-term.

Message me i have similar situation but I recovered from it thank god

After visitin another ENT, it seems like a circulatory problem. I also suspected this, because i made a lot of invesetigations, I read a lot, I used AI assistance, and nothing was consistent with Sunnder Sensorineural Hearing Loss! First is fluctuating. With all the people that lost hearing they told me happened wihtout any reversal. My right ear is way way better since I posted this, so I can reply to myself and others, yes, hearing may be reversible if the cochlea or the nerver is not damaged. So people, reading this, don't give up hope. I never accepted the idea of irreversible hearing damage, and it showed so. 

I wish I have an audiogram from today. Great improvement.",2025-07-04 15:22:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lrle23/sudden_hearing_loss_any_odds_of_recovery/

It's diagnosed as idiopathic and I have been monitoring my hearing every 2-3 months ever since. There is a difference in audiometry tests. First one was done in Canada in Apr 2025 had similar results 4 times before in tests done in Canada. 

The second one is in July 2025 in India which shows some improvement in left ear. Which is more accurate. 

Note - Had tinnitus and anxiety in both the tests which audiologist said might effect results at high frequency. 

Will it remain stable in the future or is this progressive? I am healthy 32 M

Your right ear is pretty good. The left one has some medium loss.  You have tinnitus because some of the frequencies are knocked off. The brain tries to pay more attention to the are no longer ""felt"". Before your hearing loss the brain got information in those frequencies, now is way less information so is trying to tune up the volume. That's why you may experience distorted sounds in the lost frequencies. I'm battling sensorineural hearing loss also. Is terrible.

1lrfglp,HearingLoss,Grief about loss of hearing,"So about 8 days ago, I was exposed to high intensity of pure tones during pure tone audiometry. Was told it was 80dbHL But it might be higher as I'm still experiencing difficulty hearing low frequency in the affected ear along with muffleness. I was put on 60mg prednisone on the day of the exposure but still saw no improvement. I really can't see myself moving on from this and felt like it had taken over my life. This is causing me to feel depressed and wanting to take myself out. So here are the things I want to ask.

1.  Is it possible for tts to show no signs of improvement for the first few weeks but show improvement on week 2 to 3.

2. Have anyone felt this way about their loss and how do you went about it dealing with it emotionally and mentally. Thanks for sharing your stories.

Hey, don't lose hope. Look my audiogram is improving. Slow but I can see some progress. I lost everything under 600Hz in my right ear, I can hear them and you see the progress in the audiogram however what's under 600Hz is distorted and muffled. If you have steroids is enough. Is nothing else you can do. Let's hope is going to be good. However, keep in mind, once this happened is clearly you have a predisposition to going deaf (Deaf Leppard) and this should make you more careful with your health.

The high intensity sounds in low frequency doesn't cause hearing loss. Most commonly, the high intensity sounds in high frequency lead to hearing loss. Given your hearing loss is in low frequencies, I don't think the test has caused any hearing loss. What was reason for a hearing test? If you had good hearing before the test, there is no reason for the high presentation of puretones. 
Mostly what you describe is a sudden sensorineural hearing loss which can be due to many unknown reasons.. most common through viral infection in the inner ear.. which is when Prednisone is prescribed. Complete the dosage &amp; hope for the best. Sorry to hear about your hearing loss.

I have the same problems. bass frequencies loss. they are mudded distorted. now only lower. I know how you feel. I'm fool of dark thoughts; I can't accept the new reality.

I’ve always thought temporary threshold shift recovers in 48-72 hours. 
I have a moderate to severe sensorineural loss in both ears and wear hearing aids at 34 (got them at 32). I was worked up about it at first but the technology is so good the positive aspects outweigh the negatives tenfold.

im currently  17, and i recently had hearing loss surgrey a month ago  but they had to make my ear canal bigger hear are some tips

1. Make sure to wear a cotton ball in your ear if your doctor says too
2. Rest like a lot please you'll need it

Take pain meds they help, pain isnt that bad at least from the other surgeries ive had.  
ALSO IMPORTANT

i recommend bringing headphones EVERYWHERE, my doctor said kids like me who have been deaf or half deaf (i had hearing loss in my left ear) aren't used to hearing like normal people, you're brain will be working harder to decipher all the sounds and it will wear you out, i took a 4 hour nap onetime even though i didnt mean to fall asleep  my first time going back to a restaurant for book club, i don't know if thats what its like for everyone but that is a side affect,  i could hear every sound and i mean every sound, you'll need them in crowded places.  this is my biggest tip i have because over stimulation is the worst part of it.

also if you listen to music on your headphones turn the voulme down the first 4 weeks so you dont damage your hearing :)

i am not excited for 4th of july because of all the fireworks but oh well😭

I hope your surgery suceeds and you recover well :))",2025-07-04 07:34:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lrcsnt/im_lost/
1lr8h6t,HearingLoss,Small hole in eardrum. Please read for details. Is this normal to let be?,"Female Age: 29 Height: 5’4

Hi everyone. When I was little I had frequent ear infections and had ear tubes at one point. I had an ear infection this past September and impacted wax. I went to urgent care who tried to irrigate it but it made it worse and hurt really bad. I called an ENT and saw a physician who gave me another prescription of amoxicillin and then removed the impaction with the suction. 

She said my ear drum retracted but not perforated. Fast toward to today and she removed some soft wax that I had, and she told me that the hearing test came back good and that I had very mild hearing loss in my right ear (the one that was infected in September) she said that the hole in my ear drum is super tiny and that sometimes surgery can do more harm than good. 

She said to come back in 6 months for more wax removal and another hearing test in a year. Does that sound normal to just leave a small hole in my ear drum? Thank you

1lqn1iv,HearingLoss,"Im struggling with hearing, however my tests are fine?","I (20M) for the last year have been experiencing trouble hearing people speak. It is especially problematic when there is background noise like music, busy public environments or traffic. 

I initially thought I was just imagining it and convincing myself however my girlfriend and family and coworkers have been noticing a decline in my hearing. On the contrary however, doing online hearing tests my hearing comes back fine.

Am I just convincing myself? I’m booked in to see a professional about it soon luckily. My ears seem to build wax faster than most and I worry they may be blocked however  am unsure.

Has anyone else experienced this?

[댓글]
Well, could be a plethora of things, so seeing a professional is the best idea.   
For me personally it's the lost of higher frequencies (\~70-80dB, combined with tinnitus) mostly in the range where one would hear sounds like f, th, s - for me that makes it nearly impossible to hear in louder environments. Especially if there are many people talking at the same time

It’s called hidden hearing loss, look it up, and it can derive in problems like Hyperacusis or Tinnitus. 
The brain compensates the hearing loss by making your hearing more sensitive, this works with single sounds but not as good when there’s background noise. And sometimes the brain “fucks it up” and you end up with Hyperacusis or tinnitus, or both..

So, take good care of your hearing, avoid long exposure to loud noise, and consider taking supplements. 

Good luck 🤞

As an engineer I can assure you those ""online"" hearing tests means nothing! You need special calibrated equipment to measure hearing loss. If you feel like you have hearing loss is because most likely you have a hearing loss. You need to go and see an audiologist and make an audiogram. You should try Mimi app. Is a safer bet than online apps, but is working best if you have the headphones, they support the app. You can use every type of headphones but is more accurate if you own one of the 15 headphones or so listed in there. Happens that I have the Sony WF1000XM5 and they are supported. However even so I noticed a big discrepancy between the Mimi home audiogram and the professional one. The Mimi said I have like -21dB loss in my right ear, the medium loss is actually 36dB. Soooo yeah. Take the results with a grain of salt. Add like 10-15dB to the results and you may be close.",2025-07-03 11:20:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lqn1iv/im_struggling_with_hearing_however_my_tests_are/

Sorry to hear that. It must be hard. Maybe you are too young for a surgical intervention. I don't know. I'm not a doctor but you should ask what the odds for the surgery are. Hearing aids are just.. hearing aids. The ideal would be to restore your hearing. If the chances of losing the hearing totally are low, then maybe you should consider it at one point.",2025-07-03 07:06:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lqj48d/what_should_i_do/

1lq9lx9,HearingLoss,Phonak vs Oticon,"Does anybody have experience with both Phonak and Oticon hearing aids? I’ve been using Oticon for about 8 years but I’ve been offered the opportunity to get a pair of Phonak hearing aids through an old coworker of my dad’s. My big worry is that the Oticon Intents have a massive improvement in background noise reduction which is my primary reason for wanting to upgrade from the Oticon More 1’s I’m currently using. Any thoughts/advice are welcome!

[댓글]
Don't take this as gospel:

I wore Oticon from 2013 to 2020 Agil Pro to OPN 1. I get my HAs from the VA, and the audi I met with in 2020 suggested the Phonak Marvel because I was interested in Bluetooth, and the OPN was MFi.

Phonak is a whole different paradigm from Oticon. Very tinny sounding out of the box. Autosense is very distracting, as opposed to Oticon's approach. I gave up after 2 months, even though my audi had them sounding pretty good ,but not as good as my OPNs.

Back to Oticon OPN S 1, More, and now the Intent.

The Intent is  the best I've had, and now I DIY, so I can fine tune.

You should, if possible get a trial of the Phonak, just to get an idea if they are appealing to you.

Don't bother with anything less than the Phonak Sphere 70 or 90 with custom molds.

Both companies are offering a HA with increased reduction in background noise. They are using a new processor. The truth is the noise level would have to be extremely high for any benefit . Another way to charge more without any real benefit.

Oticon all the way, when I got my Oticon I realized everyone was yelling so I could hear them and it took time for them to adjust to normally talking

You have to pay?

For me, 100% Oticon, have a lot of experience with both. Oticon seem to sound more natural…but everyone’s different!

Sorry, I was wrong about that. I was thinking about a Bluetooth alarm on I phones which are not available as of now

Technology has advanced a lot in the last years. The most advanced HA for speech in noise (per hearing advisor and hearing tracker) is the Phonak Sphere., much better than the Oticon Intent. Which Phonak were you offered?

That said, the preference for the sound profile is  personal and it is highly dependent on how the HAs were programmed for you.  You will find Oticon fans and Phonak fans (I personally prefer Phonak) but most people who do not like the sound of their hearing aids is because they were.not programmed correctly. A cheap HA will sound better than a $8K poorly programmed HA.

The only way you will find out is to try them. Please test multiple before spending $$$$.

I started with Phonaks and found them to be very tinny. Switched to Oticon Intents and loved them. Unfortunately, my insurance didn't want to pay for either of them so I returned them and I'm about to go get Costco HAs.

I greatly disliked the Phonak I tried. I have used Widex, and resound. Oticon was not an option I have tires but if you do really well with the brand you are in you may not adjust well to another one’s programming.

That sounds great but Apple phones do not support Phonak . You must have an Android phone",2025-07-02 22:41:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lq9lx9/phonak_vs_oticon/

1lpq9uv,HearingLoss,can't hear bass frequencies after loud noise exposure. Please help.,"6 days ago, I went for an audiometry test at a private clinic. I told the audiometrist I had tinnitus, and she responded by starting the test tones really loud — like 80–90 dBHL — supposedly to make sure I could hear them. She did this on my left ear first. I didn’t get a chance to stop her during that part, but before testing the right ear, I asked her to stop starting so loud.

Right after the test, my left ear felt full and muffled — like there was a curtain over it. About 2 hours later, I saw a GP and started a course of Prednisolone: 60mg for 5 days, then tapering over 12 days total.

Now it’s been 6 days since the exposure, and my left ear still feels off. I can’t hear environmental sounds clearly — like the fan, bass in music, whispering, or soft engine noise. Everything sounds dull or distant. My right ear is totally fine.

I'm wondering: **Can temporary threshold shift (TTS) last this long — like over a week or even two — or is this more likely to be permanent?** I've been really stressed and even crying at night because I’m scared this won’t get better.

We are exposed to high range decibels daily, such as vacuum cleaners, TV, loud cars, etc. If your family is able to get to 115 decibels while chanting that is honestly impressive, as a comparable sound is a siren. I would encourage you to continue your religious practices but make some changes. 

Get noise blocking earbuds, such as for concerts, or just stuff some cotton in your ears. It does make a difference to help dampen loud sounds and provide moderate protection to you hearing.

Regarding the frustration of not hearing others, it often helps to let them know that you are unable to hear them. I've had good luck by giving excuses that people who don't have hearing loss can still relate to, such as ""My allergies have me plugged up"" or ""my ears need to be cleaned out"", humor also goes a long way as well.",2025-07-01 17:13:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lp7f3v/being_exposed_to_sound_100_decibles_average_and/
1lonvz9,HearingLoss,Airshow-Related Hearing Loss?,"I've been to plenty of air shows in the past featuring military jet teams including USAF and Navy F-35s, F-22s, you name it, along with the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds teams.

In the earlier years I was inexperienced and didn't realize that these extremely loud jets were easily capable of damaging my hearing. The worst time was in 2022 when I stood right next to the show line, and it was so thunderous it felt like every jet flyby (roughly lasted 1-2 seconds, some 30-40 flybys total in the day) was about to rip the Earth apart. Realistically though I'd say the jets were around 115-130db, and didn't help that there was loud music (maybe 100db+) was playing for probably 1-2 hours of the show, possibly more. 

Worst part was the USAF Thunderbirds, which featured six F-16 jets. Although most flybys were low power (thus not loud at all), there was one where 4 of them flew by with full power, which was easily the noisiest thing of my life.

After I left the show my hearing felt a little muffled for a few hours, and surprisingly the next day it seemed to return to normal, or at least mostly. Nowadays I can still hear totally fine, but it feels like my hearing is more like 95% or slightly less of it's original capability. (this could just be the placebo effect though, meaning it's not real).

Based on all I've said, does it sound like I've received any permanent loss, even if it's slight? I still go to airshows once or twice a year but yes, I now protect myself much better now and only maybe 1 or 2 flybys unprotected a time.

Ain't that the truth?

A couple days ago I posted in this sub an article on William Shatner's raising awareness of tinnitus - to raise money for research. It seems this may be a good step for many of us - raise awareness for funding for research. More money -&gt; more research -&gt; more options.

Hi, friend.


I have severe-profound hearing loss too, began losing hearing in teenage years. 


Are you deaf from birth? Is your hearing loss conductive or sensorineural? Mixed? 



I don't know what SOL is so can't comment on that. 


Unfortunately, in the majority of cases hearing that is lost cannot be recovered. It's a bitter pill we have to learn to swallow. 


Do you feel your hearing aids are meeting your needs? If not, please go back to audiology and make them do adjustments, as many times as you need!

I say you should stay away from CI. Is a damaging experience. Also your hearing will not be  the same, is not like hearing. You just feel in the brain some vibrations. I read the experience of the people wearing such devices and most of them said it sucks. Is just not to be deaf, but you don't have animore relsolution in the sound. Is like listening distorted craps through a pipe. You don't want that. If let's say a drug is around the corner to rebuild the damaged cells in the inner ear, or you may experience sudden recovery, you take away those chances by knocking off your cochlea by insderting an electrode inside. Also keep in mind is a foreign thing inside your body. You keep a device to the ear, another thing on your skull, doesn't sound like a walk in the park to me. Try alternative measures. I can say I have some improvement with some supplements. I smoke less, I try to keep away from stress. I noticed the hearing is getting worse after a day of work and is getting better after a night of nice sleep. You hear may return (Turn loose the swans - My dying bride) but most likely not. I also suffer from sudden hearing loss in my right ear, but I would not zap what left from my inner ear.

[댓글]
Why didn’t you ask the doctors that tested her why she is not responding to sounds at home?

You should ask your doctors about this. 


There can be other reasons than hearing loss for example the way your brain interprets the information.


Maybe she can hear what you say but not figure out what it means. Or maybe she can interpret what you say but isn't able to formulate the response she's thinking of. Or maybe she hears, interprets and doesn't feel like it needs an answer. 


If the audiologist has given her the all clear then it's not likely to be related to hearing loss

How long has this gone on for? My daughter does have mild hearing loss and stopped responding to everything for a few weeks. You could literally shout her name next to her, and nothing. But she was about 16 months old when this happened.

Why did they say you can’t do it? I’m assuming it’s because you’re underage. Can you have your legal guardian bring you in? Worth advocating for yourself to get the test. 

Might need to try another audiology clinic if you’re having problems but I’d be surprised if you still are after the above.

A GP should be able to refer you to audiology, regardless of age. That sounds wild to me, who told you that?

I don’t know how healthcare works in England but in the US, typically a parent just needs to go to the appointments with you if you’re under the age of 18. Can this be true for England? Can your parents help get you an appointment with audiology?

Sounds like you might have gone to a high street hearing centre like Specsavers. As you're under 18 you'll need a referral to Paediatric Audiology at the hospital. You can ask your GP or your Neurology team to refer you.

That's really strange. I had my 1st hearing test when I was your age (UK but not England) and it was adult audiology not paediatrics. 
If you went through your GP, then they're talking absolute nonsense because by 16 you are medically considered an adult in the UK and if you went into hospital you'd be on the adult ward not the children's. 
If it was your GP push them be firm when asking for the hearing test. 
If it was a high street place maybe their rules are different and you need an adult. 
In my experience, NHS audiology is better than private but I also know that unfortunately the NHS isn't what it was and waiting lists can be very long.

The only thing we can really suggest is for you to get a hearing test done and receive an audiogram from an audiologist in order to understand whether or not a loss exists. This is a conversation that needs to happen with you and your parents because of your age, so you'll need to advocate for yourself there. Tinnitus doesn't exclusively stem from hearing loss (i.e., sleep schedule, stress, diet, medication, etc.), and we don't have enough context on where you're struggling with speech, such as the environments you struggle in, and how often this is occurring.

Video games or music, it's irrelevant in a scenario like this. It could be useful, for both us and you, to observe the decibel measurement at which most of your games are being played. For a really general measurement, you're going to want to stay under 80db before you start seeing damage to your cochlea's hair cells with prolonged exposure.",2025-06-29 16:15:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lnijmw/im_15_i_play_videogames_but_dont_do_much_loud/
1ln7pxs,HearingLoss,How can I start the process of getting tested?,"The title question, essentially. I've been struggling with processing speech, words in music, etc and it's becoming more substantial over time. I'm in my 20s, located in Canada.

How can I get tested? What specifically should I say or bring up to my Dr to get referred for testing? 

And how can I make sure I get the testing that will actually help me (where they ask you about words and such), rather than just ""do you hear the beep, and which side?"" I don't feel like the beep test is accurate for me because I can tell there was a sound, but not make out the word in practice, and I can tell which ear headphones are playing into vs in real situations I get confused about the origin/direction of the sound.

[댓글]
No one can answer these questions without proper testing. They start with an audiogram and proceed from there if necessary. If you can hear but can't understand, they do other tests too.

If you have a hearing loss, there will be beeps you can’t hear when you are in the sound booth - and you will not even know that you didn’t hear something.  Anything you administer yourself at home isn’t a controlled environment, and that means you may hear noise from your headphones when there is a tone that isn’t related to the tone itself.

A full hearing test is going to include words you have to repeat, and even a test that asks you to repeat sentences in increasing amounts of background noise and voices.

Not all hearing disorders have to do with your ability to hear the sounds themselves, but an ENT or Audiologist will be able to help rule out different possible causes of your difficulty.

I don’t know how the Canadian system works, so I can’t help with how to get a referral or if you even need one.

I can tell you that it’s important to not get discouraged if the doctors say they can’t find anything wrong at first.  

Remember, you have symptoms that are affecting your life, so there has to be a reason for them.  If it doesn’t turn out to be a straightforward hearing loss, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to be investigated past that point.  

Don’t let doctors tell you everything is fine just because this or that disorder is being ruled out.  It doesn’t have to be something they tested for in order to be a problem.

I'm in the US so my insurance etc is different but my family doctor referred me to an audiologist.  The audiologist did the beep and words test and gave me an audiogram. They said my loss was bad enough they suggest hearing aids and referred me to a place for those.  

So my suggestion, talk with your family doctor and get a referral.

Like someone else said, you should get a referral from your regular doctor. They’ll suggest an audiologist and or ENT they think will be able to help, though looking for audiologists on your own is sometimes needed too (I didn’t have great experiences at first and i’m in my 20’s, i’m in the US so not sure how different it is but i’ve noticed the younger you are the more likely they are to be dismissive). Based off of what you said it sounds similar to what I have which is a spatial auditory processing disorder. If your regular hearing tests come back normal you should ask for an APD test. They take around 2 hours and can be overstimulating but you can take breaks usually. They’ll also do some different types of beeps if you both feel it’s not going to be accurate with the regular ones. They also heavily focus on speech during an APD test. I have tinnitus as well so hearing the regular beep tones is almost impossible for me even though i only have slight hearing loss in one ear you may have to ask yourself about the beeps I didn’t know they could do different ones till my current audiologist said she could.",2025-06-29 06:17:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ln7pxs/how_can_i_start_the_process_of_getting_tested/

I tried my best to protect my ears ever since but have recently lost my pair of loops which I wear underneath my AirPods Max. Today I was running some errands and to save time I decided to grab one of those rental bikes you can find around (I’m based in Milan, have no idea if other countries have this sort of thing too) but it was the first time I did and as it turns out the bike sucks, it doesn’t hold the road at all and I had to use all my strength to keep that thing going since the streets are a mess here. Anyway, at one point I was holding my phone to see the road on maps and I accidentally pressed the volume button against the steering bar which resulted in me blasting music at full volume in my headphones for about 8 minutes (I couldn’t stop cause I was in between cars and normally I can hold the bike with one hand but the road wasn’t allowing me to do so and I can’t stress enough how shit that bike was). My ears kind of hurt now and upon research I read that AirPods Max’s can blast volume up to 108db which is a shit ton considering that 110db for more than two minutes will cause permanent damage. Is it possible that the volume went up that much? Did I lose even more hearing? Mind you I have personalized audio settings that boost high frequencies so I think that makes it even worse. I feel so stupid I’m scared shitless rn. Thank you to anyone taking the time to read this

It takes a long time to actually permanently lose hearing at 110db. For context, I was playing in 2 hour orchestra rehearsals weekly reaching 110-115db frequently for 4 years, and I still only have slight hearing loss in one ear. Ears are quite resilient generally, so it takes a lot of continuous wear to get real damage (or some really, really loud acute damage, like 125+).

nah.... you most likely have permanent hearing damage from that rave party. you said you have tinnitus from that experience since now. Usually is a compensatory system of the brain. is increasing the volume in the frequencies where he lost stimuli (you went deaf, lost some dB). I doubt those 10 minutes of loud music did something to your ears. Not really. The exposure was too limited. However, on the long run it may ruing your hearing little by little. Try to get rid of using headphones. Yeah, I know life is sad. I suffer myself from some hering loss and I hate my life.",2025-06-28 20:58:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lmx79d/terrified_i_damaged_my_ears_even_more/

1lm0zcn,HearingLoss,Tinnitus has always been part of my life. I’m here to answer questions and share what’s helped.,"Hi everyone, I’m Dr. Julie Prutsman, and I wanted to personally reach out here because I know how isolating it can feel to live with tinnitus or sound sensitivity. I’ve dealt with tinnitus myself for as long as I can remember, and it’s one of the main reasons I chose to specialize in this area. As a third-generation hearing health professional, I grew up around this field, but it wasn’t until I opened Sound Relief Hearing Center in 2011 that I truly saw the life-changing impact of focusing specifically on tinnitus and decreased sound tolerance. Since then, we’ve been fortunate to help thousands of people across Colorado and Arizona feel more in control of their hearing health.

We started a YouTube channel to share what we’ve learned, everything from understanding sound therapy and tinnitus retraining to answering common questions we hear from patients every day. Our goal isn’t to promote anything; it’s to make these conversations more accessible for anyone struggling or just wanting to learn more. If you're curious, stuck, or have questions you’ve never felt comfortable asking, I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

We created the channel to connect with more people like you, and I’ll personally be checking in to answer questions in the comments or right here. Whether you’re newly experiencing ringing in your ears, confused about hyperacusis, or just want to hear from someone who’s been through it, you’re not alone.",2025-06-27 18:15:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lm0zcn/tinnitus_has_always_been_part_of_my_life_im_here/

1lljy9o,HearingLoss,Feel like I might have ruined my life,"Background: 24 male. Like listening to music with headphones. Go shooting quite a bit but am always wearing ear protection.

I was hunting last weekend. There was a rattle snake and one of the guys on the hunt fired 4 9mm shots a few feet away from me. Ears were ringing but it stopped and I had no sensitivity. 

The next day, I saw a boar and shot it with my 6.5 creedmoor rifle. It happened so quickly I forgot I didn’t have ear protection. Before you say anything, I know how dumb I am.

Long story short, my ears have been ringing since then, the ringing gets louder after exposed to noise and if the noise is loud enough there’s like this weird high pitch noise that also accompanies that noise. Also am sensitive to things like utensils banging against your plate and all of that stuff. I am also a bit of a hypochondriac so I’ve just been sitting all week with this issue taking control of my entire life.

I have an urgent care appointment tomorrow. Which will be 5 days after the event. And I have an ENT appointment on Monday. 

Some questions:
How fucked am I?

What things should I ask the doctor?

What treatments should I ask for? From my experience with Kaiser, they really don’t like giving you stuff unless you push for it. I heard prednol is good for early on treatment, and wondering if I should push to get a prescription.

Get a hearing test ASAP. If you have hearing loss, you can get on a course of steroids and possibly go to the hyperbaric oxygen chamber as well. For hearing loss, those are the best two treatments right away.

I explained my situation to her and how my left ear has always had a sensation of fullness my entire life. All she did was clean out my ears and send me on my way after charging me $250, which i had to pay out of pocket because they didn’t accept my health insurance. I was hoping to get some real answers about what could possibly be causing the constant feeling of fullness. I am somewhat disappointed to be honest. 

[댓글]
I’m sorry you had this experience. The same thing happened to me with my first ENT office. I felt dismissed when I said I had fullness and pain. I went to a different ENT doctor and she diagnosed me with ear tube malfunction. Basically caused by allergies. I got tubes in my ears that helped immensely. My only suggestion is going to another doctor and explain how you were dismissed and see if they can help you. I hope you get some relief soon.

I have been struggling with sudden sensorineural hearing loss and I was highly disappointed with my two ENT visits.  The doc of was in there for about 5 minutes and I had to pay a $100 co pay each time.  No answers. Waste of time. My PCP and audiologist were way more empathic and actually cared.

1lkpn78,HearingLoss,I was born with a bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the 80s. I would like to think by now…I could help answer some questions for those newly navigating the world of hearing loss. No question is dumb! Ask away!,"

[댓글]
I was born with bilateral conductive hearing loss and grew up wearing phonak hearing aids. 7-8 years ago my parents found an ENT that did tympanoplasty surgeries and restored both ears to normal hearing on the hearing tests. Through out that time, I noticed and documented what I think is a sensitivity to sound of some kind.

By the way, I want to present the perspective of the past me from that time. Right now, I more or less untangled all the confusing knots to help make sense of things.

I was falling asleep when I’m near ventilation or in situations with someone using a microphone. My gut feeling said that it’s not as simple as a lack of sleep. I remember walking into a building and feeling drowsy, sometimes a bit of headache. If I spend enough time, I fall asleep. If I get out of the building, drowsiness and headache fades away quicker. It feels like pressing and holding a button, and then releasing it. I now realize this was present at least 4 years prior to ear surgeries.

What led me to investigate all this was when I attended my sister’s orchestra concert and my experience was this across multiple concerts:

I gradually nod on and off and headache develops. Eventually I fall asleep but at the same time I’m awake and can hear the music, feel emotions, but I don’t remember what they sound like. It stops when the music stops. It comes back after the intermission. My reaction is a lot stronger, more intense, and headache can remain for a week after.

I later attended her recital and my reaction was significantly less pronounced. I made the conclusion that it has something to do with microphones and the amplification effect.

I told the ENT this experience and he basically gave a more detailed response about the hippocampus and lack of sleep. Then he mentioned something about overstimulation. 

I’ll stop here for now. What are your thoughts?

Im currently living with bilateral hearing loss … how do you cope?  I have CC cell phone and house phone and I have been looking for an app that doesn’t cost me a lot of money for conversations.

Has it progressed?",2025-06-26 03:16:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lkpn78/i_was_born_with_a_bilateral_sensorineural_hearing/

I’m in your age range and have mild to moderate loss.  Hearing aids have been an absolute **game changer** for me.

No I don't think it is minor to get hearing aids and this is important since you are musicians. Getting hearing aids would make a differrence.

I'm thinking more like getting a cochlear implant but if you have the AirPods, get the Pro 2 as they say it's better than the older AirPods

[댓글]
yes, very common. i wear both. i know many people who wear both. wire frames tend to be an easier fit than plastic but that ultimately is up to your ear real estate

I wear both. I have found that some frame work way better than others, especially when I have my over-the-ear headset on for my computer. I actually took my headset with me to pick out frames to make sure they all worked together.

I have both. I wear plastic frames as the nose pieces on the wire ones give me a headache. I put my glasses closest to my head and my HAs sit on the outside of them. I got ear cuffs from Deafmetal that help them stay on. They also make silicone loops that attach HAs to your glasses arms. By the end of the day,  I do usually end up with a headache.  Whether that's from things being on my ears all day or just from living,  I'm not sure. My dad also wears glasses with a plastic frame and HAs with no issues

Silhouette frames are super flexible and the only ones I can wear with my hearing aids. Upgrade your frames and you will have a better experience.

I have both and wear RIC style hearing aids. When I was younger I wore BTE with no issues too. 

I wear over the ear headphones like Apple AirPod Max or a beanie too during winter. A lot going on back there but not an issue. 

My only complaint is when I’m wearing a hat and sunglasses during summer, it can get a little crowded when I’m trying to hold a phone to the microphone up top but it’s not that bad.

I only wear a HA on one side. That happens to be the side where y eat sticks out a bit. I have zero problem with not my HA and glasses bow. The optician did ask me to mage sure to wear my HA when I had my glasses fitted. 

My bigger problem is my hair makes noise against my HA. I get no sympathy or help f  try on my audiologist (who is a man with short hair). I suspect I might get some help if I saw a woman, but maybe not.

It’s possible but it sucks. My glasses sit on top of my HA and it puts pressure on it. But I gotta see and hear. You get used to it.

Yes, but I wear my glasses mainly for driving and watching TV, so not always both.

Yes, I have both. I have in ear earbud like hearing aids so nothing behind the ear luckily.

Most hearing aids are pretty small so it shouldn’t be too bad to have both on at the same time. I have metal frames and my HAs mostly sit just fine unless i’m moving my hair or something and forget I have them in. My frames are also pretty thin tho so I’m sure that probably helps too.

I have both, with plastic frames and RIC HAs. 

At first it was uncomfortable, but now I keep the wire between the arm of my glasses and my head and kind of prop up the HA a bit over the arm. 

Like this: https://imgur.com/a/reLRjlH

It's super comfortable and the HAs feel more secure.

I wear both, no trouble at all!

Have a BTE and glasses. Sometimes can be annoying, but never a real problem. You’ll figure out what goes where.

Yes, I wear BTEs and glasses, no I dont struggle to keep them.on my face if the fit correctly.

Me and it's uncomfortable wearing both...‼️‼️‼️

My daughter had to wear glasses, hearing aids and for a very short time SMO braces 😅 thankfully she's now into just inserts...

I use both.  

I found headphones for my computer were just too much with both so I switched to the one ear style. It doesn't crunch everything all together like standard ones, so I don't end up with painful ears.

Here! very common and no problem at all if you choose the glasses carefully.  Sometime the optican will also make you aware of that as well.

Was diagnosed with severe hearing loss last year and it's been 10 months of wearing Oticon Intent hearing aides. I also wear glasses. The audiologist fitted me with child size hearing aids because my ears are small and it sort of helps but yeh, things are pretty stacked up behind my ear with glasses, ball cap and sometimes a mask (for virus protection). It's not ideal at all.

Both, I wear Ric hearing aids. I always need my glasses but prefer to use them only when I watch tv. I totally dislike putting the hearing aid and glasses in the ear in the same spot, too much weight and pressure.

I mean, I don’t have to wear my glasses, they just ease the strain on my eyes more than giving me sight ability. Neither really disagree with each other since both my hearing aids &amp; glasses are very light. It’s wearing a mask that bothers my ears when either are on with it.

I used to wear both (HAs stopped working and can’t afford w new pair,) but I never had a problem wearing both and I don’t have particularly big ears

Yeah and I recently became paralyzed waist down 😂 It can never be just one thing! But to answer your question - my glasses fit fine with my hearing aids.

I wear both. Strongly suggest wearing contacts is you can!!

I wear both but never feel truly comfortable. 

I've tried on top of glasses arm, and the recommended between the ear and the glasses. It makes my ears flare out slightly. Which I don't like. I mean there's only so much room between your ears! 😝

One thing that helped was putting short silicon sleeves on the end of the arm. Then have the glasses adjusted to be looser. 

The silicone helps my glasses stay in place without the need for serious bent angles behind my ears.

I wear both but depending if some days I need to wear hats I would wear contact lenses, but when I go out I would wear the the Sony ITC ear buds and contacts lenses

I wear the insignia BTEs and sometimes wearing a hat and glasses annoys the heck out of me

yes. i did it for more than 40 years until i got cochlear implants (which had an even bigger thing resting on top of my ear).

I started wearing hearing aids at 10 for a hereditary sensorineural hearing loss.  It was prevalent in my family tree, but people didn’t tend to get hearing aids early in life among the older generations.

I would discuss whether she might still need two hearing aids - if there is any loss at all in the other ear, having hearing aids in both has a multiplicative effect because the brain will favor information from the “better” ear - if that makes any sense.  It’s been several years since an audiologist explained this to me because I went a few years at different times with just one hearing aid, and having two was always such a difference.

What I can tell you is that you should treat it like a completely normal personal hygiene sort of thing.

I wouldn’t get so wrapped up into her making it part of her identity.

It’s just like glasses - and kids these days know all about ear buds and things in ears, so the stigma of seeing things in ears isn’t the same as it was maybe 20 years ago.

She won’t see any of this in a negative light if you treat it as just a thing you deal with.

I didn’t even see myself as having a disability until I was an adult, because my family just spoke louder and more clearly as needed, and I learned to advocate for myself when I needed something repeated.  It was just a normal part of my life.

The Americans with Disabilities Act was first passed when I was 8 years old, and it was a long time before accommodations became a regular thing.  I had to sit in the front of the class, but it was an informal request from my mom or sometimes just myself to the individual teacher.

In school in the ‘90’s, I really didn’t get made fun of when I had hearing aids.  If anything, kids tended to be curious about it.  We didn’t have fun colors, but my hearing aids in high school were in-the-ear with the outer part flesh toned and the inner mold translucent red for right and translucent blue for left.  Other kids thought that was cool.

I don’t tell people about my hearing loss (you’d be surprised how oblivious people are to hearing aids) until I’ve talked to them for a bit - because it’s easier to tell someone how to alter their voice (if at all) after you’ve heard them for a bit.

I made the mistake of telling a nurse at the doctor’s office this from the beginning, so she sat down next to me and basically yelled in my ear.  I had to ask her to go back to sitting across from me, because I needed to see her face and holy crap, just getting louder usually distorts things anyway.

Your daughter is going to adapt really easily to using context clues for sounds in speech, and having hearing aids will let her brain not have to work so hard to do that all the time, which is great!

Parents always seem to worry about negativity over a child’s hearing loss when it really isn’t something a child thinks about unless people in their life treat it as negative and “different” in a bad way.  Kids largely just want to find their place to fit in socially as they go through school, so I wouldn’t push her to think things like “I’m hearing impaired but I’m just as normal as anyone else.”  I would focus on her having the responsibility to make sure she is getting what she needs in communication with others and in class - that means making sure she has her hearing aids in and maintained, and that she asks for captions on videos when appropriate, and that she tells someone to speak up or more clearly, or more slowly as needed.  

On a fun note, kids loved playing telephone with me because the outcome was always hilarious.

Let me know if you’d like me to answer any questions as someone who had a mild hearing loss starting from early childhood.

Did the doctor order oral steroids or ear injection? Because they are time sensitive. Do it ASAP to save your daughter's ears

She’s young enough to not be missing her hearing; I have congenital SSNHL and while the hearing aids we’re a great blessing I’ve never felt like I’m missing anything. It’s an entirely different experience to being hearing and losing it as an adult

I would discuss whether she might still need two hearing aids - if there is any loss at all in the other ear, having hearing aids in both has a multiplicative effect because the brain will favor information from the “better” ear - if that makes any sense.  It’s been several years since an audiologist explained this to me because I went a few years at different times with just one hearing aid, and having two was always such a difference.

What I can tell you is that you should treat it like a completely normal personal hygiene sort of thing.

I wouldn’t get so wrapped up into her making it part of her identity.

It’s just like glasses - and kids these days know all about ear buds and things in ears, so the stigma of seeing things in ears isn’t the same as it was maybe 20 years ago.

She won’t see any of this in a negative light if you treat it as just a thing you deal with.

I didn’t even see myself as having a disability until I was an adult, because my family just spoke louder and more clearly as needed, and I learned to advocate for myself when I needed something repeated.  It was just a normal part of my life.

The Americans with Disabilities Act was first passed when I was 8 years old, and it was a long time before accommodations became a regular thing.  I had to sit in the front of the class, but it was an informal request from my mom or sometimes just myself to the individual teacher.

In school in the ‘90’s, I really didn’t get made fun of when I had hearing aids.  If anything, kids tended to be curious about it.  We didn’t have fun colors, but my hearing aids in high school were in-the-ear with the outer part flesh toned and the inner mold translucent red for right and translucent blue for left.  Other kids thought that was cool.

I don’t tell people about my hearing loss (you’d be surprised how oblivious people are to hearing aids) until I’ve talked to them for a bit - because it’s easier to tell someone how to alter their voice (if at all) after you’ve heard them for a bit.

I made the mistake of telling a nurse at the doctor’s office this from the beginning, so she sat down next to me and basically yelled in my ear.  I had to ask her to go back to sitting across from me, because I needed to see her face and holy crap, just getting louder usually distorts things anyway.

Your daughter is going to adapt really easily to using context clues for sounds in speech, and having hearing aids will let her brain not have to work so hard to do that all the time, which is great!

Parents always seem to worry about negativity over a child’s hearing loss when it really isn’t something a child thinks about unless people in their life treat it as negative and “different” in a bad way.  Kids largely just want to find their place to fit in socially as they go through school, so I wouldn’t push her to think things like “I’m hearing impaired but I’m just as normal as anyone else.”  I would focus on her having the responsibility to make sure she is getting what she needs in communication with others and in class - that means making sure she has her hearing aids in and maintained, and that she asks for captions on videos when appropriate, and that she tells someone to speak up or more clearly, or more slowly as needed.  

On a fun note, kids loved playing telephone with me because the outcome was always hilarious.

Let me know if you’d like me to answer any questions as someone who had a mild hearing loss starting from early childhood.

I’m a hearing parent of two elementary aged hard of hearing children. I have tried to hype my children up about their hearing loss. I got fun accessories for their devices. We are starting to learn sign. They have not been negatively affected socially. We have changed as a family how we communicate with them. Face your child when speaking. Tap them on the shoulder to get their attention. It’s okay to repeat yourself. Teach them to advocate for themselves in settings with lots of background noise. Are you in the US? Get with the public school system when your child starts school and get the ball rolling for a 504 plan for accommodations. Give your child hearing breaks when needed. There’s a lot to learn, but you can do it! Kids are amazing and can adapt easily, especially at that age. You’re doing great!

Im so sorry your daughter has to go thru sensorineural hearing loss. Im so sad right now that she is so young to handle it when I cant even handle it myself at 33. I will pray for your daughter.

1livxlq,HearingLoss,Seeking input from the community on day-to-day communication challenges,"Hi everyone - I'm exploring whether a communication tool I'm considering would actually be helpful for people who rely on sign language, or if it's just another unnecessary tech solution.

Before building anything, I want to make sure this addresses a real need that the community has identified, not something I'm assuming from the outside.

I'd love to hear from your experience about what communication challenges you face day-to-day and what tools (if any) have actually been helpful vs. just more tech clutter.

Happy to chat here in comments or via DM if you prefer - whatever works better for you. Thanks for any insights you're willing to share.

i dont see what your idea is, but general issues with much of the tech that comes out is not helpful for deaf people. for example, those signing gloves that attempt to translate signs to speech is still aimed towards hearing peoples’ access. honestly, advocating for sign language, learning sign, and making learning sign more accessible for hearing people to learn is what would help. tech is great, but when it comes to sign language, theres no substitute. hearing people are often just too lazy to learn (besides few exceptions) and want something easier. but even technology often puts the burden on deaf people financially, physically, and mentally. maybe others will have different opinions, especially since many are late Deaf, but your question was addressed to those who use sign language. what would make my life easier as a Deaf ASL user is hearing people meeting us half way instead of putting the burden of communication on us all of the time",2025-06-23 23:30:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1livxlq/seeking_input_from_the_community_on_daytoday/

I recently went to our local public pool with my husband and our son. I happened to help a kid who was struggling to stay afloat, deposited him on the side where he was safe, and rejoined my family. The lifeguard came over to speak to me (I could not understand a word he said) luckily my husband was there to intervene. Later he told me the lifeguard was reprimanding me, telling me to keep a closer eye on my kid, which my husband told him ""He's not ours.""

It feels helpless in the pool/beach/water. I will never go without my husband or son. I feel your pain. I hope you find a solution!

I am brand new on my HA journey but have been researching this very thing! I love being around water. I found the Phonak Lyric goes inside the ear canal and then you can buy custom made swim ear covers so you can just live life. 

I’m headed to an audiologist appointment in just a bit so I’ll see what their opinion on the matter is!

so far for me ASL is all that i can do in this scenario!

Tell them to shout! lol no There was once the Siemens Aquarius but it’s discontinued. If you can find a pair of those you might be in luck.

1lhsy4a,HearingLoss,normal audiograms,"yall, PLEASE. 99% of the audiograms on here are above average. here is some info:

1. audiograms are YOU telling the audiologist what you hear. if you “couldnt hear anything”, your audiogram would not be above 20db. 20db and above is normal hearing

2. if you feel you have troubles processing/understanding speech despite a normal audiogram, there are MANY things this could be. AuDs can run tests for hidden hearing loss (synaptic disconnections), APD, etc. 

3. tinnitus is the actual worst, but not always caused by hearing loss. you can have awful tinnitus and zero hearing loss

4. while there are anomalies, AuDs are not incompetent (no im not in the field). if you have a hearing loss, they will find it. if you have a processing issue, they can test for it. there are tests for just about everything. 

everyone experiences hearing differently, but if you advocate for yourself and something is wrong, there are tests that can be done. i have even noticed people that are “wishing” they had hearing loss. 

maybe i am wrong but i came to this group for support with hearing loss. it seems majority of the folks in here do not have hearing loss and it just kinda stinks for those of us who do. 

all that being said, if i am wrong and this group is somehow for diagnosing hearing loss, if anyone can point me in the direction of an actual helpful/supportive sub for people with actual hearing loss, please let me know

[댓글]
Please book yourself a test.

This is so strange, I did something similar around a year and a half ago. Used ear drops that came with a small bulb to irrigate ears, although I didn't do it forcefully. When I did it in my left ear, everything went muffled and the world went quiet. Went to see a nurse, said I have a perforated ear drum and it's swollen. Had a hearing test, results pretty much normal. See an ENT last week as problem still ongoing, turns out I have mixed hearing loss in my left ear and need I need a hearing aid. For now he has put it down to unexplained conductive hearing loss. Weird, right?

Great to get a hearing test. You did irrigation to remove earwax? If so, are you confident you got it all? If irrigation doesn’t remove all the wax, you can sometimes get a wax occlusion and you’d be left with a conductive hearing loss. This would be fixed by having your ears professionally cleaned to remove the remaining wax. 

Was there a moment of great pain during the irrigation of the ears? The primary concern would be a perforation of your eardrum, but that’s quite painful and you’d know if that happened. 

Regardless, get the test. Try not to stress. If your hearing was fine before this then you’re probably going to be ok. But best to get it checked out just to make sure.

Rapid hearing loss like you are experiencing is so hard. I've been there. My hearing did improve but not all the way. Eat well and try to rest. I know its scary and confusing and frustrating, but you will get through it. Avoid ototoxic foods and medicines if you can in the meantime. 

 It could all resolve, but if it doesn't please know, this is the very worst part of it. Life will get easier. Your brain will adapt, and new hearing aids are amazing if it does turn out to be a long-term thing. 

You can and will get through this!",2025-06-21 15:01:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lgykkn/feeling_so_lost/

I had my headphones connected to my laptop and I didn’t saw that the volume on the laptop was full. As soon as I started the song it was too loud and sharp and I quickly removed my headphones within maybe 2-3 seconds. But I had a lot of pain in both my ears for 2-3 days, there was no blood or tinnitus though.  


After 3-4 days I went to the ENT who said I had swelling but the everything else was fine and gave me medicines.  


Now I didn’t felt any hearing loss as such but after this incident whenever I encountered any loud noises like in a club my ears would hurt and feel clogged for many days and I also felt at the time that listening in crowded places was uncomfortable.  


Later on I saw another ENT who told me to do a audio test which showed small hearing loss and ENT told that it’s weird that I would get a nerve damage from the headphone incident and he didn’t recommend me any hearing aid’s based on my result.  


But till today I always have this crackling in my ears also with a feeling that they are not fully open and also during fever I also feel stiffness in my face and ears.

Not a doctor, but no, doesn't sound like it. Neither sudden nor sensorneurial. Most likely inflammation/infection as a result of repeatedly irrigating your ear. Consult with a doctor again if any doubts

On March 7, I was involved in a physical altercation where my left ear was forcefully pulled, resulting in: • Severe bruising and swelling • A deep laceration behind the ear that required stitches

I didn’t notice any hearing issues immediately after the injury, though the area was sore for weeks.

Then on April 26 (about 6 weeks later), I suddenly experienced: • A “pop” or full sensation in the same ear • High-pitched tinnitus • Muffled hearing

On April 28, I visited an ENT and was diagnosed with high-frequency sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in the left ear only.

Multiple doctors have told me the trauma is unrelated due to the time gap, but the timing and location make me wonder otherwise.

Could delayed-onset SSNHL be triggered by earlier trauma (possibly microvascular or nerve-related)? Has this been documented in any cases? Or is this just a coincidence?

Hi! I have a very similar pair. They aren’t going to cause additional hearing loss, but you may want to give your ears a break after 2-3 hours. It’s good for your brain to work a little harder to hear ambient noise and process those sounds. I find that any more than 4 hours exacerbates my tinnitus, but that’s totally anecdotal!

There's no scientific evidence pointing to any risk from using noise-canceling headsets. The main benefit, as you pointed out, is that people tend to listen at lower level because of the cancellation of the ambient sounds.

There was a [recent report](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/auditory-processing-disorder-headphones/) published by the BBC, and later picked up by several news outlets, that noise-cancelling may be responsible for something called Auditory Processing Disorder — basically the brain not processing certain sounds well. 

There was a rebuttal article published by the [NY Times' Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/auditory-processing-disorder-headphones/) who interviewed 11 expert audiologists and neuroscientists who agreed there's no scientific evidence pointing to any harm from using noise-cancelling headsets.

Yep, I have a similar pair of Bose headphones, and I also use AirPods Pro with noise cancelling. Mild hearing loss with hearing aids here - but I take them out when I’m using headphones. 

I actually had those Sonys but I had to return them - I was experiencing “eardrum suck” no matter what I did. It’s all psychosomatic though, if you don’t have the problem then don’t worry about it.

We weren't able to pin point the specific reason for my hearing loss, however I was born 3 months early, I have a chiari malformation on my brain and I was also without oxygen for a bit while in the incubator (mind you this was in the 90' so care for premature babies was a bit different).

1le5h07,HearingLoss,"Sudden Hearing Loss Recovery — Still Having Ringing, Pain, and Vertigo. Is This Normal?","Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice or hearing about similar experiences.

Around the last week of March, I started experiencing severe ringing in my ears. I was officially diagnosed with sudden sensorineural hearing loss in early April and was immediately prescribed oral steroids and other medications. The steroids lasted for about a month, and I continued other meds for around two months.

When I had a follow-up in early June, my hearing test showed improvement. However, I still feel pain and ringing (tinnitus) in my ears. My ENT said I no longer need medication for my hearing and should just monitor things.

Lately though, I’ve been getting bad headaches and episodes of vertigo, so I went back to the ENT. They prescribed me new meds for those symptoms. We did another hearing test, which still came back okay. The ENT reassured me that even though the ringing and discomfort are still there, there's no need for hearing-related medication anymore—just the vertigo meds.

My biggest concern now is that I’m planning to fly home in August, and I’m nervous about being on a plane for 5+ hours. I’m afraid it could make my symptoms worse or trigger another hearing issue.

Has anyone else had a similar experience where the hearing improved but the ringing, pain, or vertigo persisted? Is this kind of long-term discomfort normal even after treatment?

Would love to hear your thoughts, tips, or stories. Thank you in advance!",2025-06-18 02:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1le5h07/sudden_hearing_loss_recovery_still_having_ringing/
1le54eu,HearingLoss,bubbles in my ear drum?,"hey there, sorry for the gross pics, but I need answers

so when I was born, I was deaf, and through lots of surgeries, I was able to hear, however growing up i had many ear infections, to the point of bleeding for months from my ears. Flash forward to now, I tend to have an extremely excessive wax build up, which I believe is maybe in part to my ears being really small?

My hearing has been significantly worsening out of nowhere, to the point where I can hardly hear my partner sitting beside me in the car. I have no idea what it is, so I decided to check on my hand dandy ear camera and realized that when I hold my nose and blow, these sort of bubbles flare up? I have no idea what it means. Every doctor I go to just gives me something to drain my ears, but nothing has ever worked. Only my ear camera scooper has worked. I'm just really concerned because no doctor seems to be taking things seriously and I'm worried I'll be deaf or something soon because of something they're missing.

the first two images are my left ear before and then after blowing, and the last two are my right ear before and after too. You can definitely tell a bit more in the last image, two separate, almost balloon like things pop up for a moment.

I literally have zero knowledge about this stuff please anything helps.

1lc9t3x,HearingLoss,Second Opinion or Just Wait?,"Hi I had posted almost a year ago about my then under 2 year old who we had hearing testing done due to a speech delay and family history of hearing loss. His results then were inconclusive. First image. We were referred for an ABR but then moved states and had to start the process over again. He’s now 2 and had testing done at 25 months. I do have some concerns about his hearing as he seems unbothered by loud background noise (for example we were at a dance party last night and my daughter with normal hearing couldn’t tolerate the music level but he didn’t even seem like he could hear it) and he frequently mishears words (for example run/drum/jump, kick/kiss, snack/nap). 

The most recent testing done at 25 months seemed … bizarre to me. The audiologist prefaced that she usually doesn’t attempt the test that she did as young as him. She then gave him a bin of blocks and told him to throw the blocks into another bin when he heard the birds. I watched him and I could see on his face when he was hearing vs not hearing. When it was clear he wasn’t hearing anything she would say “you heard that bird right? Throw the block!” Which of course he was thrilled to do cause he’s 2 and 2 year olds love to people please and also throw things. Afterwards she touted that he was the youngest she ever successfully completed that test with. I’ve attached all the results from that appointment. The recommendation is testing again in a year. I’m wondering if it’s worth getting a second opinion before then or to just wait the year? There has been some talk of Autism and/or audio processing disorder or some other developmental delay but we aren’t rushing to move forward with additional testing at this stage until we meet with the occupational therapist through early intervention. He’s getting early intervention for communication and social delays. ",2025-06-15 20:12:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lc9t3x/second_opinion_or_just_wait/

1lc49ib,HearingLoss,Conflicting ABR Results for My 4-Month-Old – Advice Needed,"Hi everyone,
I’m a parent of a 4-month-old baby girl and we recently went through a bit of a rollercoaster with her hearing tests. I’m posting to share the details and get advice on what we can do next — if anything — while we wait for follow-up.

⸻

First Test (04 June 2025 at 3 months 25 days old– Clinic A)

Test: Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA/ABR)
Result Summary:
	•	Right Ear: Wave V clearly detected at 30 dBnHL → Normal hearing.
	•	Left Ear: Wave V only detected at 70 dBnHL → Interpreted as moderate hearing loss.

They also noted no replicable peaks below 70 dBnHL for the left ear, which led to the diagnosis.

⸻

Second Test (05 June 2025 at 3 months 26 days old– Clinic B)

Test: Repeat ABR + OAE (Otoacoustic Emissions)
Result Summary:
	•	Right Ear: Wave V detected at 40 dBnHL
	•	Left Ear: Wave V detected at 30 dBnHL
	•	OAE: Pass for both ears

The audiologist noted good waveform morphology and replicability, suggesting bilateral hearing sensitivity within normal limits. Overall, this result contradicted the first test and offered a lot of relief.

⸻

Current Plan

Both clinics have recommended a “wait and watch” approach, with a follow-up ABR around 6 months of age. They advised us to monitor her responses to sound and keep track of speech and language development.

⸻

My Questions to You All
	1.	Has anyone experienced such a discrepancy in ABR results for infants?
	2.	Could the first result have been influenced by temporary issues (like middle ear fluid, noise, or baby movement)?
	3.	Is there anything we can do in the meantime to help her hearing development or expedite follow-up?
	•	Would a third opinion help?
	•	Is there any way to get further ENT input before 6 months?
	4.	Is OAE + ABR (pass) at 3 months usually reliable enough to stop worrying?

⸻

Any advice from parents or audiologists here would be greatly appreciated. We’re trying to stay calm and hopeful, but it’s hard not to worry. I

I am also attaching link to reports.

Thank you in advance!

[댓글]
i have. honestly its really frustrating as someone who lost all hearing. i try my best not to compare but i find it to be annoying at times. audiograms are literally the person telling the audiologist that they heard a sound at a certain level, but then try to say they cant hear (processing issues aside). i just dont understand

Especially when they add on how terrible it is, and I'm over here thinking I'd be thrilled to go from profound to severe loss..

Many people who have little experience with hearing loss come to this sub to get answers. They'll get an audiogram from someone they did not understand and/or trust and come here to get more input.

They don't really understand what constitutes good or bad hearing, so treat them like you would someone who is experiencing the process for the first time.

I've noticed it also. I think it's a testament to how pointless those audiograms are. My hearing is significantly reduced and distorted, and I recently received a normal audiogram. They should by default go up way higher and include speech in noise to diagnose people with what's deemed ""hidden"" hearing loss. It's only ""hidden"" because those tests are deficient.

Definitely seen so much of this lately very annoying and discouraging as I myself have profound hearing loss for a year and a half now on a waiting list for cochlear implants which is a year long

An Audiogram is a quantitative test. It's for screening purposes, because any auditory processing disorder highly unlikely presents itself with a normal audiogram. 

That said, if you have trouble understanding speech with a normal audiogram, it's an uncommon and complex situation and you need to see a good ENT.",2025-06-14 22:51:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1lbldlo/whats_with_all_the_people_in_here_posting_their/

1lbe5kt,HearingLoss,Diagnosed with permanent unilateral hearing loss two days ago - not doing well,"I have always taken really good care of my hearing: I wear noise cancelling headphones a lot just to walk around / in cafes when I am writing or reading so music isn't loud. I have always worn ear plugs to concerts and clubs, even if it isn't 'cool' or whatever. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD about 4 years ago, despite paying thousands for private EMDR therapy and getting rid of all my symptoms, and rebuilding my life: people keep assaulting and abusing me, and the last 4 years have just been a constant cycle of: someone decides to abuse or assault me. I seek help from anywhere and everywhere: scream and make a scene begging for help, I am ignored/help services ignore/gaslight/abuse. I have lost a career and PhD scholarship, gone from being a very extroverted and social person with lots of friends to being extremely withdrawn and hyper-vigilant, and just getting by. I finally, after years, felt like maybe I could survive and be ok, I was making friends and feeling more confident, working full time, and going out again...And then my brother-in-law just decided to start a campaign of abuse against me (I am a lesbian, he is a bigot, you do the math...), including abusing his connections with the police to have me falsely arrested and assaulted and have my phone taken. 

In the midst of trying to survive this abuse and get help, one day, I very suddenly lost hearing in right ear. Because I was so stressed, where normally, I would have gone to a hospital - I told myself maybe it is stress and it will go away. As I was dealing with extreme PTSD, I managed to see a doctor for the hearing loss after an appointment for PTSD a week or so after the hearing loss started. I had also had an ear piercing that got infected on my right side - so I thought it might just be an infection. The GP said they couldn't see any sign of infection. I was referred to an ENT a few weeks later, and then an MRI and another appointment. Because of my phone being taken I missed the second ENT appointment. The MRI took a few weeks, then I was given another ENT appointment in 6 weeks, I said this wasn't acceptable as I was missing work because the hearing loss was so significant, so I got one a bit earlier. Audiology test came back the same as before (significant hearing loss in right ear - above average hearing in left ear), MRI test all normal. ENT said it was either meneiere's disease or could be genetic or from a virus - but was adamant in not doing anything else. I was given a hearing aid that doesn't fit as it is too big for my ear and that was it. 

Last night I could not sleep - (despite taking medication I already have for PTSD to help me sleep) - and had thoughts of cutting my ear off / stabbing my ear / hurting myself to make it stop. I called 111 and they said I'd get a call back from out-of-hours, I then got a text saying I would not get anything and it is closed. I called in distress again a few hours later, a patronising woman asked me what I could do about it...

I emailed my GP today asking them for urgent help and intervention. No response. I am now scared for tonight incase I don't make it.

A few minutes after it happened I was walking through a noisy enivorment and I can't hear a single word my friend was saying next to me on the right, I could only hear the background noise, this happened again later on. It felt like everything this was to quiet or to loud. 

  
Now today my right ear feels muffled and sounds different to my left. And when I 'blow' internally, I can always hear the wind sound on the right side. I might not have lossed any hearing but, it sure sounds way different

Is this temopary or permanent?

Should I get it checked out?

this happened to me in march.  i fell n hit the back of my head on a ledge of a white board. anyway my right ear got muffle for about one hr almost two hrs. the doctor said it was a concussion most likely. i got an egg bump. i deal with this muffle hearing for a few weeks. like it came n go.  now is ok 


advice. any head injury needs to be evaluated.  specially if u lose your hearing or get a bump. the doctor puts you on bed rest for 24-48hrs n gives u tylenol for swealling.  u dont need to pass out for it to be a concussion. just a simple hit can cause it specially on the back of the head.

1law8w4,HearingLoss,lost +30% more hearing,"Hiya at 43 I learned I have tinnitus. 
I woke up at 4am as I hear a loud bang right next to my head. Like a gun shot. But 2nd floor, windows closed and locked. Doors closed and locked. No guns in house. 
Days later did a hearing test to see if anything in my head popped. All clear. 2 days after that and a full blood work up did the hearing test in the box
They couldn't hear the sound so they said it's all in my head 😶 then got angry when I said yeah that's where all my audio equipment is. I thought it was funny. 
So all their measuring said I have lost +30% more hearing than I should by my age. Plus the sound I said is like an old tube TV powering up or water through a pipe. They were younger than me and said they do not know what a tube television is. 😶 
I tried the drops and various other things for tinnitus. Zero help. All the other non medicines. 
Not medicinal as my heart condition would become worse. 
I can live with that though. I mean I would love to go back to hearing nothing but the sounds around me but that's life and many other people have far worse. 
But my issue is I'm tired of telling my family I cannot hear them. 
""Did you hear that?"" 
Me ""no what are you talking about?""
""That noise you didn't hear that because I did.""
Me ""how about I set you on fire and you tell me if I can hear you screaming or not?""
""Don't need to be an asshole"" 
And honestly I feel I very much do. 
""Didn't you hear me?""
Me ""no, I cannot hear you because your voice doesn't travel in the store.""
""I can hear so why can't you?""
Me 😶
They're the same about my heart condition. At 36 I had heart failure that left me with the function equivalent to an 80 yr old man. 
""Why can't you move that fridge?""
""Why can't you mow the yard and trim the hedges?""
""Your aunt so and so had the same thing happen and she was able to build a house.""
Good to dig her up and have her help. How old was she again when she died?
""40.""

1l9evv9,HearingLoss,"Possible NIHL, need help what to do","Hello,

so around August last year I noticed slightly diminished hearing in right ear. Did hearing test in September, dips to 25db in 4 and 6 khz range. Been told that my hearing is normal. So I didnt care that much. Around december january I became paranoid that its getting worse and I went to multiple ENTs, did another hearing test with similar results - 30db hearing loss, and another which again showed 25db loss. I did brain and ear MRI. Then in April I received steroid nasal spray and been told that in 2 weeks my hearing will be normal. But after 1 week I began so paranoid that I was checking my hearing on everything multiple days a day. Phone apps,  I would cover my left ear in certain situatuon to check if the hearing is worsening. It was so exhausting that I cant even describe the feelings in words. Nothing I did improved my hearing. The nasal spray left me with permament ear crackling and clicking, especially at night. This added to paranoia. I was protecting my hearing in basically every situation. I would use 35db earplugs when I was going to drive my car at any greater distance. Things I never did in the past or even gave a thought. But last week after checking my hearing for idk 1000th time I said to myself that enough is enough and I need to deal with it. And last week I went to the bigger city to have some fun. I went to a bar to get a drink. The bar was really loud and I was there for 10-15 minutes before I received my drink and left to drink it outside. Thought nothing of it. 3 days later I had scheduled audiologist appointment from a month back when I was appoiting visits to the doctors left and right. So I decided to go anyway as they are highly regarded and You need to wait some time to get there and also to finally close it. So it was yesterday and I was shocked to see that now I had 50db dip at 6khz. Which is 25db worse than my last hearing test I had in February. I mean the test conditions were not the best since I could hear people on the hallway and it was distracting however this is not enough for 25db difference. I didnt have any proper test between february and june so officially I cant tell when could it happen. However thanks to my paranoia and checking it everyday with youtube videos with certain frequencies I know that the difference was much smaller between ears at 6khz. And i checked it around a week ago. So normally I shouldnt be able to tell when this happened but due to reasons above I'm certain that it happened last Saturday. I still find it unbeliveable because all my life I didnt care particulary much about hearing protection. Of course I wasnt stupid, but I would not hesitate to go to a bar before. There were plenty of people there even sitting right under the speakers where I was about 10-15 meters from it. So the doctor told me to do iontophoresis with calcium chloratum for 10 days to my right ear. I dont even know what is it. However he was neglecting the dip and said that perhaps it wasnt my day and if it was the bar then bartender and DJ would be already deaf by now. But I'm checking the same youtube videos I did during my paranoid phase and now I cant hear the frequency at all until its loud enough. The question is should I push for prednisone now and try to make it better. I have some tinnitus in this ear. I had tinnitus before but only on some days. The other days it was totally quiet. But now it doesnt go away at least at the moment. The other ear seems not affected and is generally within similar thresholds. 

Sorry for the long post, but no doctor is ever listening to me long enough to describe it..

[댓글]
I can't say much about whether you should take prednisone, that's a question you should pose to an ENT. I would hesitate to rely too much on that doctor that you've seen. There are individuals with greater susceptibility to hearing loss and some people in that bar may already have damaged hearing but not realize or care. It makes no sense to state ""if it was the bar then bartender and DJ would be already deaf by now."" Who knows if the DJ and bartender wear hearing protection or how the dispersion patterns of the speakers (some speakers have horns, etc for higher frequencies and those may have wide or narrow dispersion patterns) and where you were located might have exposed you to greater sound pressure levels than others.

Still you should not necessarily worry - yet - about that increase in your hearing threshold. It's possible that you are experiencing a temporary threshold shift due to your exposure to loud music in the bar. It may also be due perhaps to some other reason which you cannot really trace either. What you may hope for is that that shift may resolve on its own.

However, there is no way to distinguish between a threshold shift that is temporary and one that becomes permanent. It probably makes sense to consult an ENT very quickly.",2025-06-12 05:53:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l9evv9/possible_nihl_need_help_what_to_do/
1l99et9,HearingLoss,Interesting presentation on regenerating cochlear cells,"I ran across a presentation by James Hudspeth of Rockefeller University that I expect many may have missed. It's fairly long at about 55 minutes but I think it's worthwhile.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsiKj7M52Ks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsiKj7M52Ks)



Key takeaways:

He talks about their attempt to identify any known compounds that could trigger replication of supporting cells. Out of 140,000 that was tested using a robot, they identified one non-toxic compound. Then, they analyzed 250 variants of that to better match the target protein: 

[https://youtu.be/NsiKj7M52Ks?si=EO3FiVPtS-7NhU8A&amp;t=1342](https://youtu.be/NsiKj7M52Ks?si=EO3FiVPtS-7NhU8A&amp;t=1342)

Addressing the possible application of AI to research, he also mentions that the 3D molecular structure of the LATS 1 and 2 proteins that they ended up targeting could not be characterized by X-ray crystallography. He also mentions that some researches were using AI to determine the 3D structure. Identifying that structure would allow for the development of molecules that can better target those proteins:  
[https://youtu.be/NsiKj7M52Ks?si=\_hK8DyyAW3ZzJJi6&amp;t=2275](https://youtu.be/NsiKj7M52Ks?si=_hK8DyyAW3ZzJJi6&amp;t=2275)

He suggests that delivery to the ear and controlling the dose can allow one round of cell replication without causing cancer. I suppose it helps that these cells do not replicate on their own:

[https://youtu.be/NsiKj7M52Ks?si=\_c7q9hTzKC-ypTZl&amp;t=3249](https://youtu.be/NsiKj7M52Ks?si=_c7q9hTzKC-ypTZl&amp;t=3249)

  
My understanding:

There are several companies that are working on non-invasive delivery of compounds to the inner ear and there already seems to be a promising compound that could trigger replication of supporting cells. Since it's a small molecule (i.e. not protein, RNA, etc.), I expect it can cross the round window but it might make sense to control where it ends up in the cochlea so the magnetic nano molecule approaches might be best suited for this.

While the overall message is very promising, I'm kind of surprised that there appears to be no great rush at beginning testing on other mammals. He does say that they could begin testing on muscular dystrophy patients under the FDA's compassionate care exception.

With respect to our needs, I expect where they are stuck is the actual conversion of supporting cells into inner and outer hair cells. I have the impression that the resulting hair cells that were produced in other research are not perfectly functional, at least that's been the case for some of the research I ran into.

Apologies for missing the distinction before but I'm still learning essential anatomic details. I went back to the presentation to figure out which types of cochlear supporting cells were induced into mitosis. Only I realized that their amazing results only apply to the utricle, so those are supporting cells for balance hair cells. They had very limited success in the cochlea.

You may find the details in the below article:

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8149661/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8149661/)

A more recent article identified p27^(Kip1) as another protein that needs to be suppressed for the proliferation of cochlear supporting cells.

[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2411313122](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2411313122)

While I don't have access to that article, there is a summary below. Sadly, they've worked with transgenic mice so as far as I understand they don't have a way to reduce p27^(Kip1) levels in wild mice yet, or in humans for that matter.

[https://scitechdaily.com/gene-switch-reboots-sight-and-sound-a-breakthrough-in-sensory-regeneration/](https://scitechdaily.com/gene-switch-reboots-sight-and-sound-a-breakthrough-in-sensory-regeneration/)

So does that mean support cells turn into the hair cells? Or is it that more support cells are made to become the hair cells?

Great talk thanks for sharing

There is another important finding in the 2021 article on the initial identification of the compound that they named TRULI.

&gt;Our data suggest that, in addition to inducing proliferation, TRULI treatment leaves newly formed supporting cells in a plastic state.

Meaning that the daughter cells following mitosis could be made to transdifferentiate into hair cells.

However, they are referring to utricular supporting cells given that cochlear supporting cells did not proliferate for the most part. Perhaps, a similar result may hold with cochlear supporting cells.

Another important finding - that could also be inferred from their success with mice - is that the supporting cells migrate into the hair-cell layer so I hope that means that the hair cells will be in the correct position - once they can be successfully generated.

&gt;Although almost none of the cells expressed Pou4f3 or Myo7A, many of the EdU-positive supporting-cell nuclei migrated into the hair-cell layer. This pattern is consistent with the first stages of transdifferentiation.

I'm uncertain about any unintended consequences of introducing such molecules into the middle ear, whether they would induce any proliferation there or in the utricle for example . Otherwise, they may need to be directed to the cochlea using magnetic nano molecules.",2025-06-12 00:58:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l99et9/interesting_presentation_on_regenerating_cochlear/
1l98pej,HearingLoss,22F Nervous About Significant Hearing Loss in Right Ear,"i got my hearing tested last May while getting my ear checked out for one of my (several) ear infections i’ve gotten throughout my life and they said i have mild hearing loss and have apparently been experiencing hearing loss since i was 11 years old (despite the fact that none of my doctors felt the need to tell me this until i was 21 years old) but since this test my hearing has only gotten noticeably/significantly worse in my right ear. it’s literally gotten to the point where, for the past almost 9 months, i’ve had to have almost everyone i talk to stand on my left side so i can actually hear them clearly with my left (good) ear.

earlier today i went to the walgreens clinic to see if there was any ear wax or anything that could be causing such a drastic difference in hearing level/quality but they couldn’t see or find anything. i have another doctors appointment/hearing test on Monday, but i’m really nervous about it because (no offense) i don’t necessarily want to be hard-of-hearing or need to use a hearing aid for the rest of my life, especially not before i even turn 23 years old in around a month. don’t get me wrong, i would love to know what’s going on with my hearing, but i don’t want it to be something that effects almost all aspects of my everyday life for the rest of my life. (😢😭😭)

This is not significant, but still it’s not idea and it’s essential that you get to the bottom of why it’s happened so you can protect against further loss. 

What you have here you will live a completely normal life with.

I'll happily swap you. You can see my own audiogram recently posted. I've worn hearing aids since I was 18.

I  have mild to moderate reverse slope hearing loss.  I've had a fluctuating hearing my entire life.  

Right now, hearing loss isn't that severe and should only have minimal impact.  It's something you've probably had for a  while.  Now you know what it is and can adapt.  With mild hearing loss, it's definitely your choice on how you want to handle it.  Missing lower tones means you are missing a bit of volume.  So, yeah, for many years, it meant having someone stand on my good side.  Buying headphones and adjusting the base. Sound coming from behind me is difficult  to pick up.  Just be careful on busy streets, mine is moderate plus I have problems with ongoing ear infections, so sometimes it dips to severe.  

Your hearing of voices is pretty normal.  You just lack a bit of volume.  It's frustrating more than anything.  Be careful crossing streets, especially if you get a head cold or ear infection.   While I do not have problems understanding people in a quiet environment.  Without my HAs I have difficulty hearing trucks.  This made walks rather interesting in my new build area.  

Ideas for adapting, well I read lips a bit.  I didn't realize how much I was doing it until this year.  You might try those apple esrbuds rated as OTC hearing aids.  Most of the time, you'll be fine, so the short battery life won't bother you.  You'd just pull them out as needed.  I chose hearing aids as I spend about 50% of my day in noisy environments.  I tried cheap OTC hearing aids from Amazon.  They're great for streaming, at home, and restaurants with just a bit of noise.  But my daily is louder, and it's exhausting to lipread all day.  So, I chose HAs.

Note, that doesn't mean you need HAs.  With a mild hearing loss, you can function without them.  The apple HAs might be fun to try.  I expect it'd be nice and less tiring to get a boost now and then.  But do not hesitate to advocate for yourself if you spend much of your time in noisy environments.  While you can function without them, if it's exhausting, why should you have too?  So, just know you have choice.  The choice you make may depend on your listening environment

Is this considered reverse slop hearing loss? Your high frequencies look pretty solid. Any tinnitus? I just got bad news about my hearing loss as well.

Do you smoke? And if you work a job that has alot of sounds particularly large machinery i could see why your hearing is lacking in the lower frequencies. I personally wear hearing protection constantly for even kitchen jobs as plates or metal objects constantly being smacked around can peak at 90db or more and over time cause hearing loss. Im sure the ear infections dont help and if i were you i'd try to have some meds stashed so you can jump on treatment early when you get another one.",2025-06-12 00:23:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l98pej/22f_nervous_about_significant_hearing_loss_in/
1l97htr,HearingLoss,Could an organ of corti grown in a dish be a possibility?,"I've been reading about the various approaches that researches are pursuing to regenerate the various cells in the cochlea, but I've been wondering - given that they are able to connect cochlear implants to the auditory nerve - could they not implant an organ of corti grown from pluripotent stem cells and connect that to the nerve?

Are there or have there been any attempts along this line?

I think your questions are good ones! I saw some papers out of Stanford that were looking at this but they're older papers that didn't ultimately succeed.

There's some cool papers out of Harvard Medical School that are using stem cells to try and grow ear organoids, but so far they're a long way off from making something with function matching the natural ear. It could still be a great way to find ways to promote regeneration. 

Although I'm wondering if the President's attack on Harvard is going to get in the way of this.",2025-06-11 23:26:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l97htr/could_an_organ_of_corti_grown_in_a_dish_be_a/
1l94p8b,HearingLoss,My Journey with Moderate SSNHL Early 20's M,"If you have experienced loud ringing/muffledness/or even partial reduction in your hearing that is persistent between days, IMMEDIATELY go to your doctor and if they can't see you go to urgent care or a hosptial. Once you have a refferal for an ENT, call the ENT office and request to be seen as an emergency patient and express your concerns over ssnhl and the time senstivity, dont stop until you have an appointment within the week. Time is priceless to fighting this condition. Stop smoking cold turkey aswell. The withdrawls are worth the chance for a better recovery.

So on may 20th i experienced a very loud burst of ringing accompanied with extreme muffledness while i was playing games with my headset on. I get these time to time, they're short and sweet and im fine after with no problems. I've had them all my life in both ears usually a couple times a year. I figured it was just a normal thing but now im beginning to question that. My hearing was completely fine after about 40 seconds to a minute. Right back to normal i thought. But now i remeber that a few days prior my ear seemed a little more senstive to loud sounds and i was having to turn my headset volume down more than usual.

2 days after this incident which seemed to be louder than normal ringing bursts, the ringing had turned on in my right ear suddenly. I did just about everything you could thing of, i took Acetaminophen, benadryl, ibuprofen, flonase, TRP ear ringing relief drops, Lipo flavanoid, magnesium, zinc and ginko bilboa supplements, comepletely cleaning both ears with carmide peroxide and distilled water.  I DID EVERYTHING. I finally went the doctor the next week and he didnt see anything so he told me to take aleve and sleep it off. I wish i got a second opinion now.

Basically i had experienced a very mild (in comparison to other stories) form of SensorNeural Hearing Loss. Im unsure what my true hearing loss was in the first week, probably 20 to 30 decibels i think. I only started taking prednisone on the 13th day since onset of symptoms and it only seemed to be effective for a few days. 

I was terrified of what this meant and its been difficult to sleep. I have 100% speech recognition but i can still tell the difference between my ears. I decided to stop smoking cold turkey, no alcohol, no weed, no antihistamines like benadryl, just water and the cleanest food i can eat. 

On top of it i have started doing hyperbaric treatments. I was going to one place that operated at 1.6 atmospheres but that only worked a little bit in the beginning. 1.3 atmosphere with the little nose nozzle for oxygen is not effective at all as i tried that too.

I found a place local to me that has the same Medical Grade, Perry Brand, hyperbaric chambers and they're allowed to operate at 2.0 atm with 99.8% oxygen canisters. 

Most people seem to be unresponsive to it but i have been getting 5 to 10% less ringing each day after treatments with the perry systems. Im on treatment 4 of those. And im trying to do as many as i can but at 100$ per treatment and im running out of cash.

I dont know if the tinnitus will every go away but its finally to a point where AC units dont hurt to listen to and instead can mask the tinnitus.

I have been also wearing earplugs in the car whenever im driving over 45 mph (like the highway) to protect my ears as much as possible except for bone amplification. But it usually stays eithin 60 to 70 db in the car anyway. 

I believe that Hyperbaric is now soley responsible for my hearing recovery this last week as its been 22 days since onset i think. Besides the praying i have been doing. I dont know if the tinnitus will ever go away but im still hopeful since the range of frequencies between my ears isn't massively different.

6 days ago to hear 3700hz to 5000hz i had to turn my headset volume to 14. Today i tested it and i can now hear those frequencies with even more stability as i increase it at only 5% volume. I was shocked because just a day ago it reduced to 10% volume from 14%. 

Anything above 5000hz is not improving at all is likely the source of my tinnitus i think. 

Unfortunately i have not regained any of the lower frequencies as the NIH suggests for current and former smokers. Idk if its because ive been a smoker or i smoked too much in the first week and half or what. I have been completely without nicotine now for over a week. And only smoked 1 pack since the onset. So if youre going through this early and your smoking STOP SMOKING.

All in all im doing better, ill never be the same again, but im doing everything i can. I am thankful to be one of the lucky ones that didnt experience severe or profound hearing loss and seemed to make a partial spontaneous recovery despite the ringing. I will be attempting acupuncture at somepoint but not until im done being able to afford hyperbaric treatments.

The photo of my hearing test was 13 days since onset  the true decibel loss i experienced is not known. I could still hear for sure but it wasnt reliable. Speech recognition was definitely lower the first few days. 

If you'd like to support me financially to continue treatment (im broke af, this is all going on credit) pm me and ill provide you the link to my fundraiser.

Mad how you’re here in a hearing loss group, with a chart that shows your full hearing to be within normal range, asking for people to send you money to help with hearing loss.

Hold on. This is your current audiogram? This is normal range. I'm not sure why you think people should give you money.

Uh, I lost hearing in my left ear entirely. I’d kill to have this level of hearing.

I'd recommend you get acupuncture paired with energy healing and see if that will help. I wish you the best.

This audio gram is after i had a spontaneous recovery and it was taken 2 1/2 weeks after onset. I only mentioned the funding because its run me dry trying to treat this without insurance. My actual loss of hearing within the first 2 weeks is unknown. And i believe that this audiogram isn't accurate, im fairly certain i imagined the beeps a few times as i had what seemed to be mutiple tones of tinnitus playing in my ear. I expect that my next audiogram will actually look worse than this one. I just wanted to provide some hope for those that search for it as most of the stories are horrific.

I'd say my real loss was 40 or 50 decibels within those first 2 weeks. I know im one of the lucky ones that had a sponatenous recovery and i'm not trying to beg for sympathy. I have a friend who has gone functionally deaf from concerts and it's been a real shame watching his mental decline.

Since it seems to offend people, I'll just remove that part. Im dead broke after treatment, but at least i can hear, and im thankful for that. The tinnitus has been pretty severe, however. As i stated, it matches the volume of litterally anything i can hear and is accompanied by hyperacusis, which makes anything high pitched like appliances brakes AC units or even taking a shower pretty painful and unignorable Going to sleep has been a challenge this last month. 

Im not begging for sympathy from anyone, i just wanted to share my experience since it's more positive than most others that i can find. Stress doesn't help anyone, and i wanted to put a beacon of hope out there for people that may be experiencing ssnhl in its early stages.

Again, yes, the audiogram is posted in acceptable hearing levels (my left ear is great), but i dont believe it is truly accurate; the volume difference between my ears with my headset is nearly 20% before i begin to hear those higher frequencies again. I do expect the next one to be worse. (They rushed my whole appointment and wouldn't let me take it again)

I am fully aware that 50% or more cases are severe and profound hearing loss and i feel so sorry for those people. This whole experience stopped my life in its tracks and it wasn't even a severe case. I may end up going to medical school and get involved with the hearing field because of all of this. I wish there were more treatments and a way to restore the hearing to those mostly impacted. Or people who are no longer in the first month of their loss having an option other than leniere's devices, which takes alot of time and dedication to see results if any.

I had severed basically most of my index finger off and had to have surgery and ended up getting stem cell injections for it and that actually almsot fully restored my finger's function and removed the nerve pain i had. I'm greatly interested in how stem cells could be administered to the ear for hearing loss in the future. Hopefully it becomes an inexpensive and relatively common practice in the future.",2025-06-11 21:26:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l94p8b/my_journey_with_moderate_ssnhl_early_20s_m/

1l8xfx8,HearingLoss,Can we share tips how to manage life with hearing loss?,"At this point I am not really able to give many tips myself. I am living since 5-6 years with singlesided hearingloss, and I find it difficult to manage my life without full hearing, because our environment is not created for hearing disabled people. I know I am not alone with this. 


I dread the situations where I probably will not be able to participate and I make a cost benefit calculation before I ask assistance because sometimes just asking the assistance is exhausting and possibly humiliating. 


I slowly start to consider the advice I received from some friends about not disclosing my disability and just do what I am able, i.e. let go of my plans and be ""properly"" disabled.  Yes, because of discrimination and humiliation. The emotional cost is just too high. 


The few recent incidence where I have had to publicly disclose myself and ask help have been painful, but I also feel that I have learned from them alot, especially to prioritaze my plans more and care less about what others think of me. But it comes with the mental cost, additional to the hearing fatigue, and so I become doubtful if it is all worth it and what is there left at all. 

At this point I really can not see a good solution, because however I act I feel like I am wrong: against my plans, against my personality, against societal expectations to be deaf-and-dumb or deaf and not needing anything more than normal hearing person. 

So...I think it would be great when we could give here some ideas and random experiences that have worked for us ind different situations to overcome the disability. 

I am at the university right now and the only tip I can think of at this time to others also in university is to observe how normally hearing students try to be competitive without shame, and take that as an inspiration: when requesting hearing assistive measures. You know the first row that always asks and raises hand without any hesitation. Thinking that I am not doing much different than them, when I am requesting help, I have felt somewhst better.

I’ve had hearing loss in both ears since I was born. I’m also sound sensitive to certain sounds and hearing aids are physically painful for me to wear. I tried, but they’ve been painful since I was a child. 

I’ve honestly just come to own it. Ive told all my coworkers and remind them regularly, especially if they repeat something at the same volume if I ask them to repeat themselves. 

When I tell someone, it looks something like this: “just so you know, I have minor hearing loss in both ears. But I don’t wear hearing aids, which can be confusing. Please know that I’ll never ignore you, so if you say something and I don’t respond, I just didn’t hear you or realize you were talking to me. If I say something that doesn’t make sense at all, then I misheard you. And I’ll do my best to explain if I’m asking you to repeat yourself a lot or make it clear which part I didn’t hear. I just wanted you to know! It can make for some pretty hilarious moments at times, too.” 

If I’m just out somewhere and it’ll be a quick interaction and I don’t wanna go through the whole thing (like a checkout line somewhere), I’ll just say something like “sorry, I have a hearing loss. Can you repeat that a little louder?” More often than not, people are happy to accommodate and work with me. If anyone gives you a hard time about it, then they’re rude and hopefully you never have to deal with them again, or minimally if so. 

I do honestly think owning it works best. I used to be embarrassed, but once I started owning it, I found that the judgements  of others stopped bothering me nearly as much. 

That said, I’m sorry you’re going through this and struggling! I can’t imagine what it’s like to develop a hearing loss as an adult!

I felt this deeply. I could've written it. I don't have tips. I'm still struggling with isolating myself because it's just too much and too hard. ♥️

I started wearing a badge that says 'a bit deaf, not stupid' and found it really helpful, particularly when dealing with new people. then again, I don't really have a problem in disclosing I have this disability. 
I have another badge on my backpack that signals a hearing loss, good to prevent weird or funny situations (like getting scared when someone passes fast by me on my deaf side).

Hey, I am so sorry you are going through this. I have moderate hearing loss and had to go through university without hearing aids due to...well, the utter expensiveness of these devices. I know all too well how shitty it is that a lot of people think you are mentally disabled or stupid, when you actually simply have hearing difficulties. But I would give you 2 tips that helped me survive:

1. Start letting people know. I usually start convos with new people by telling them ""Hey, just so you know, I am hearing impaired, so sometimes I will need you to repeat things or I'll be on my phone to connect to my hearing aids"". This is to let them know. Now, this usually comes with 2 responses: people are either understanding and try their best to accommodate, or they become shitty and make fun of me. In time I learned to have a thick skin to the second category, and even see it as an advantage because idiotic people simply reveal themselves to me and I know to avoid them in the future. 

But seriously, in professional settings or at uni, they are somewhat obliged to behave decently. You should definitely ask for any accomodations you can without shame. Usually people are happy to oblige.
Ask your friends to meet in quiet places, where you can participate in convos. Ask for subtitles during university courses if you can (Microsoft Teams generates live subtitles btw, it can be used for in-person courses if the professor is willing to connect to it). Tell your professor to save a front row spot for you. Use whatever opportunity to ask for accomodations, you deserve it.

2. If you can afford hearing aids, buy them asap. Try to get informed on the best types, that have good noise filtering. In my case, I changed a few pairs until I found my perfect match (I tried both Signia and Phonak, and honestly the Phonak seems to be really good with noise filtering, they are my favorites so far). Do your research, try on multiple pairs before deciding to buy one, and go for it. They are real life savers.

What has helped me is realizing most people are just saying pleasantries. Smile and nod. If you misinterpret, they will say again. I have had hearing loss in both ears for 13 years, have hearing aids, and you will learn to cope! Don’t let it stop you!

I’ve been living with hearing impairment for a few years now. Certainly consider saving some $ for hearing aids. I wear mine proudly and while it isn’t perfect, my relationships with others has improved (especially my wife) Try some OTC hearing aids. I have two different pairs from different manufacturers. Both are good in different situations. Don’t seclude yourself, let others know as others have said that you have an impairment. I don’t feel there is a stigma with having hearing aids as much anymore.

Friend, you are not dumb. Being deaf doesn’t make us dumb in the same way that having perfect hearing doesn’t make people smart. 

Please, stop masking. You are deaf and have rights to accommodations. Sign up for a caption phone, relay service, or whatever your government provides. I recommend learning sign language. It’s a long road, but communication without needing to hear is amazing. 

The next time you run errands, try going voice off. Use a pen and paper or notes app to communicate. Hearing people assume you can understand speech if you speak first, even if you say “I am deaf, I cannot hear you.” That is avoided if you write down your coffee order for the barista.

I’m finally taking college classes too. The worst part is the 5-15 second delay in the captions. I’ve had to fight low participation grades. The teacher asks a question and some already answers it before the captioner finishes typing.

I have had hearing loss for over 30 years after a virus.  Yes, get hearing aids. The state vocational rehab office may pay for them if you are working. Get the best you can. And yes, advocate for yourself. I also try to choose my environment as much as possible in social situations. I suggest quieter restaurants or less noisy time of day to get together with friends or movies with captions.  The TV connector which can be used also to hear music allows me to hear music and tv very clearly as it connects directly with my hearing aids.  Listen Wifi is an app allows good clear hearing directly to hearing aids if the venue has purchased ListenWifi. Some churches,  theaters and concert halls have it. I understand your reluctance at work but it is necessary to speak up and either get special accomodations or change job duties. I have found most people at work places to be accomodating. It is not the fault of the hard of hearing community that people are so often ignorant about hearing loss.  There really should be more education so that all professions understand people with hearing loss and know that it is not ok to ridicule or dismiss people with hearing loss.

Late here but came across this and I truly feel that as well. It can be tough navigating hearing loss and asking for help when you don't want to. Your tip about owning your needs like others do is really smart 

Btw one thing that can help is always leveraging tech like live captioning apps on your phone to catch what you might miss during calls or in person conversations. There’s a free app called [Nagish](https://getapp.nagish.com/7Z9B/eojo3uc6) that does this quietly in the background and has helped a lot of people manage hearing challenges more easily

I am 16 and hard of hearing. I wear hearing aids, and I have been since elementary school and growing up with that was TOUGH. My confidence and self-esteem were shattered, and it was difficult to even talk to my dad about the struggles of not being able to hear. I was embarrassed but what I can say is that it gets better over time. It really all comes down to confidence. I don't think you should fully disclose that you are disabled, as it is very important and it affects your everyday life, and I think it's important for others to know that. 

Affirmations are what really helps me and with my chronic anxiety. Telling myself that in the end no one gives a shit and if they do then they are an asshole. It's not hard at all for another person to raise their voice or to repeat themselves to me and I deserve to have the right to be included like the rest of them. It's also the thing that it's important to embrace that I am different because not only in the future will it help me, but it will also help those who are growing hard of hearing in the future. Also, everyone fucks up. Everyone has embarrassing moments and memories and I'm not alone. I'm human like everyone else. 

This is coming from someone with a crappy dad who makes fun of me and puts me down for my disability, so again, in the end it will get better and as time passes you will grow more comfortable and confident.",2025-06-11 16:40:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l8xfx8/can_we_share_tips_how_to_manage_life_with_hearing/

1l8bf6x,HearingLoss,Hearing fades to “ooooooo” the back to normal,"My hearing sometimes fades to a “ooooooo” noise for about 5-10-15 seconds then fades right back to normal. Maybe the longest one I have had was 30-60 seconds. I can still hear when it happens it’s just drowned out by the “ooooo” sound until it stops. 

Happens about once every 2 weeks to a month, either ear. Longest gap between them maybe 3 months?  

My hearing tests have not changed. One time I panicked thinking it was SSHL and took prednisone for it. But if I did that every time this happens I would be on it constantly. 

Any ideas what this is? Does this happen to anyone else here?

Very normal. Most people, if not everyone, get this.

I have this at least once a month. Hearing fades ear rings then it all comes back.

Because I'm so focused on anything to do with my hearing it freaks me out everytime. But everytime it dissapears within a few minutes. 

Look up SBUTT.

Sounds like a flash bang going off? I get this too, also every couple of weeks or so. As a sufferer of SSNHL it used to freak me out but I’m used to it now

I think it's called fleeting tinnitus. I’d say it’s usually normal, although it depends on the case. In some situations, it acts as a defense mechanism against loud noises; for that reason, the ear might temporarily lose hearing due to protective muscle contraction.

In my case, it only worried me once: it lasted about 2 minutes, was bilateral, and came with pain. I think it was due to ischemia, since a week later I experienced dysacusis.

The good news is that it’s almost always benign. You shouldn’t experience hearing loss. However, if it increases in frequency or intensity, it wouldn't be a bad idea to seek a medical opinion.

It's called low frequency tinnitus.

As long as it's not pulsating, or accompanied by hearing loss / vertigo / facial paralysis, it's mostly benign.

Get your regular audiograms done.",2025-06-10 21:46:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l8bf6x/hearing_fades_to_ooooooo_the_back_to_normal/
1l89qha,HearingLoss,"Im 14, and i think my hearing is shit","So I’m 14. I didn’t really listen to music until earlier this year. At first, I listened at low volumes, but over time it crept up to the point where I was listening at almost full volume.

For the past 4 months, I’ve kept it around 60–70%, but I checked my iPhone stats and it shows an average of about 83 dB from my headphones. I usually listen either through my headphones or my guitar amp. The amp is on the left side of my desk, about 40 cm away, and when I talk to people, I tend to leave my left headphone on.

Lately, I’ve started to notice my left ear more,not pain, but just a weird awareness or sensitivity, like it’s more “active” than the right. I did an online frequency test, and I could hear up to 6 kHz in my left ear, and 7 kHz in my right. (This was after listening to some music.)

Now I’m scared that I might have permanently damaged my hearing. I love music a lot, and I don’t want to lose that.

What should I do? Is this permanent? Can it get better?

(Please don’t say “go to the doctor” — I understand that’s the best answer, but due to personal reasons, I can’t do that right now.)

Since going to a doctor isn’t an option right now, the only thing I can think to suggest is that you absolutely must turn your music down. It is not worth your hearing.

Ask the school nurse if hearing tests are available.  There's also an option to supplement with vitamin E to help hearing loss but you need medical guidance to do this. You can only take it for a short time before you will get bad side effects. You cannot take it without guidance. .

If you have airpods there is a hearing test you can take, its moderately accurate. Also depending on your state, as you are a minor, see if your school or city has any programs, most hearing tests are free.

The activeness you mention can come from stress, which heightens tinnitus (ringing/buzzing in ear and sensitivity to noises), higher blood pressure increases it basically. Also, if you partake in smoking weed or nicotine this can mess with what you pick up, as your senses can be heightened.

As someone who's had moderate hearing loss throughout their teen years, the only thing you can do to 'improve' your hearing is through protection and focusing. I love listening to loud music, so I use earplugs meant for concerts, which protects your hearing while still enjoying loud music [Earbuds for protection] (https://a.co/d/1NpqNED).

With focusing, this is a bit of a test to see if you might have some hearing loss. If you can hear the quieter background noises, like a/c, wind, water running in the distance, you don't have much to worry about. If you can't however, focusing on these sounds can actually grow the area in your brain to recognize them and heat better (according to my audiologist).

If you do have airpods put them on the hearing aid mode, if you hear a ton of background sounds that you don't hear normally, it could be moderate hearing lose. 

You could also just have wax build up or inflamed eardrums, many things can impact your hearing for periods of time.

I would say not to stress about it, just be mindful of the noise you expose yourself too. Once hearing is lost it cannot be regained, and hearing aids truly don't do justice to natural hearing.",2025-06-10 20:39:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l89qha/im_14_and_i_think_my_hearing_is_shit/

1l84mi5,HearingLoss,"Tinnitus and Hearing problems, but no hearing loss at 20. Ear exams came out fine and ENT and Audiologist told me i was fine, to just wait. 4 Weeks inn.","My hearing seems to be fine and better then ever from the tests I've done and ENT and Audiologist says my test came it perfectly healthy and fine. I'm at 4 weeks into my tinnitus and hearing issues, but there is this barely audible background Static that stems from the brain(the most annoying and current one) and low freq zapping electrical Tintius that is just edging in the background(it's not constant ringing and it just pops up at random and tumbles down for a few seconds on my right ear, very odd). I've had tinnitus for about a month, week two was the end of the worst but it did not die off fully and i still have issues with soft sounds and it being too sensitive at db the same time, while waking up it does completely go unheard but thought out the day it just comes as I hear more sound. 

 I got my tinnitus after an loud scream from a guitar amp that blew up on my face without protection when i was getting ready during practice. I had more intense tinnitus,muffled hearing, nerve issues hearing on my right ear, and was bedridden, clearly depressed, could not eat and unable to work and my parents told and inisted heavly to me it goes away honey and the calling the hospital wont do anything since its ""low priority"" and they would hung up and ""just don't drive to them"" how stupid was i not to.

then i was forced to go right back to blue collar work and i had muliple breakdowns at site and wanted to quit so badly the following days, only week one i opened up at the job and could leave for a week. 

Day two, I tried to communicate with me mum and she called the doctor to say what happend and got an appointment at day 8 and got sendt to the ENT at day 14 to tell me they did not belive my take on things(ENT doctor checked my ear 5 times in 15 minutes, no wax, no signs of damage, and Audiologist just gave me a pitch test witch was 100% all right but nothing to do with my problems i proposed) from the results and there was no need to drive to the city for any treatment whatsoever, ""Just to reintroduce you're ears to the climate"". My mom said it was a sight of relief and that there was nothing wrong and that they are the experts in the room then told me to go right back into work and shut off any futher discussion about it.
And I don't know if I had Sensorineural or TTS. My right ear feels like it's a other distance or the warmth and focus is just gone and its just not there anymore, it just feels dead/Mono when i listen to music, TV, conversations, anything to do with hearing in general. And cannot enjoy the silence of things, but I can hear fine according from both tests I do daily. But ive heard hearing loss or sensorineural releated tinnitus just just doesn't simply go away and I'm dead scared. 

 I can't really play guitar anymore since the strings alone litteally will hurt my right ear from the vibrations and acoustic, with pain and nerves touching on my cheek istantly. If I wear mufflers and plugs it does not appear at all at work until I plug it off when im done then boom it's back. It's less of it sure but idk if it will ever go away now, i told them multiple times really early on too they just didn't care.

 I asked the ENT and Audiologist if I could at least get some help or see if there was need for recovery steroids they give out for SSNHL and if i fit the criteria; they told me no not really, you're young and spry and wait 5-8 months and that was it no matter how well i tried to explain everything, i think they told me it was just regular tts or just a part of the healing process or whatever but two weeks later still the same. 

I called them agian today two weeks later to see if I could get another appointment (to check my inner ear, hair cells, coheala, but there are very few specialist who actually do that in Norway and most of the equipment is very basic and are meant for old ppl to get hearing aids quick or for people to get ear wax removed, if you actually have a problem you are done for in the countryside by that timeframe you insist apon it, it's just not a topic.) They told me there was no need since it would be just like the same and that I would be fine and refered me to an audiologist(bascilly moral support at this point) witch will take about 4 business weeks if I'm lucky.

1l7j5ra,HearingLoss,Tinnitus at 18,"Hello, I’ve had tinnitus for about 3 months now and have already seen an ENT doctor, but they said everything is fine with my ears (normal hearing test). However, in the Apple hearing test, I can see that my hearing drops off a little bit at 8kHz. Could the tinnitus be caused by that, or are things like jaw or neck problems more likely?



[댓글]
It can be hard to know what causes tinnitus. Have you been exposed to loud sound on a regular basis? History of ear infections?

Tinnitus can be associated with jaw/neck tension. Do you grind your teeth or clench your jaw?

Sometimes there is no obvious cause to tinnitus. It’s a fairly common thing to get and as long as your audiogram is normal we can rule out anything worrisome about your ear health. 

From a general health perspective, tinnitus is not something we are particularly concerned about. We more so are concerned with if it’s bothering you very much.

1l6ibjd,HearingLoss,Normal range of high frequency hearing?,"Hi all, the normal range up to 8khz is anything below 20db HL. But how is it defined for the ranges up to 20khz? Still the same?
Is it expected that the curve is falling down there already at age 35 or should a normal hearing individual still be within the 20db HL range?

Thanks a lot!

[댓글]
For frequencies above 8 kHz, there isn’t a universally standardized “normal” threshold like the &lt;20 dB HL used for 250–8000 Hz.


Yes, hearing thresholds typically worsen above 8 kHz even in healthy individuals, and this decline can start as early as the late 20s to 30s. It’s normal to see a gradual drop-off in sensitivity in the 10–16 kHz range by age 35. 

In clinical practice and research, thresholds up to 20 dB HL are often still considered “normal” at extended high frequencies, but this range shifts upward with age, meaning thresholds of 30–40 dB HL at 12–16 kHz may still be considered age-appropriate.

So yes, it’s expected that the curve starts to fall beyond 8 kHz with age, and being above 20 dB HL at those frequencies doesn’t automatically indicate pathology if there’s no other hearing concern.",2025-06-08 17:53:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l6ibjd/normal_range_of_high_frequency_hearing/

Hearing was muffled in one ear and tympanogram was not perfect but in normal range. I also got tinnitus in that ear. After it got worse I developed SEVERE anxiety. I didnt know how to survive an hour or day because it was so bad. I couldnt leave my flat and cook. I also was dehydrated and couldnt go grocery shopping. After about 8 weeks of that  and 6 days of anmost no sleep and stress i developed dysacusis (echo hearing, metallic hearing...). Heraring tests were normal though with thresolds reaching from 0 to 10 dB (Pure tone, OAE, ABR...). After that i got even more anxiety and was suicidal since. I developed another tinnitus in the other ear and muffled, subjectively worse hearing. No doctor can find anything but now i have 5 things that nobody knows how to treat. I think i also have a bit of circulatory issues due to stress, iron deficiency amd low blood pressure.  I tried physiotherapy in the beginning and accupuncture with no success... I had no loud noise exposure and I am femalew and 33 years old. I heard of hidden hearing loss on here. Do you think extreme stress every day over 14 months can cause hidden hearing loss/synaptopathy or does this sound more like a psychosomatic issue?

I can somewhat relate! Tinnitus started after a pretty stressful period in my life, with anxiety, bad sleep etc. Hearing tests all came back normal but my symptoms got worse: Subjective feeling of muffled and dull sounds around me, not feeling ""present"" in the moment. Now I feel trapped in a cycle of stress and anxiety and symptoms, and endless thinking. I can't tell if this is all in my head or actually some form of damage, but I start to believe the former.

Has anyone an idea?

1l4xasw,HearingLoss,Little improvement in a month after car accident,"I was in a minor car accident four weeks ago that was completely my fault. Sadly, both driver- and passenger-side airbags deployed even though I had no passengers and nobody would have been hurt.

I didn't immediately notice that I had significant hearing loss over 3-4 kHz in the right ear. I had significant ringing in my right ear which seemed to subside during the next day, similar to what appeared to be the usual experience for those involved in such accidents. As I already have had some tinnitus in that ear for over two decades and I was able to hear conversations - despite some muffling in the right ear - I missed the hearing loss at first. I began taking NAC and Mg right away when I realized.

The audiogram on the fifth day revealed 70-80 dB loss over 4 kHz. I had four intratympanic injections of dexamethasone starting right away, as well as 480 mg of methylprednisolone in pills over 10 days.

My ENT recommended to delay starting HBOT until a few days after the injections were completed, so I started almost two weeks after the accident and have had 11 sessions so far. Successive audiograms have shown only limited improvement, 20 dB at 4 kHz and 10 dB at 6 kHz. I would have continued regardless despite the limited improvement but my ENT also recommended that I continue HBOT until I reach 20 sessions total.

I've read several threads in this reddit and I'm aware that further improvement is unlikely to be significant, so this post is an introduction and an attempt to tell my story. I would still appreciate if anyone has encouraging experiences to share.

It's a shame that airbags have been in cars for at least 60 years, and yet how loudly they deploy does not seem to be common knowledge and likeliness of hearing loss is downplayed. I know people who have been in major car accidents and none of them have talked about any hearing loss afterwards. Perhaps they were much more fortunate than me or simply unaware. I'm quite surprised they are not interested in investigating.

The few people I talked to tell me there is no great loss as I can understand speech in both ears with minor impediment in the right. I know they are right to an extent given that at least I do not have to deal with the emotional burden of having hurt anybody else besides some damage to their vehicles.

What I'm finding rather difficult to deal with is that the day of the accident and the day before are extremely vivid in my mind and I'm aware of tens of junctions where I could have gone another way and not ended up where I did.

And the worst is that I was returning home after picking up a gift for someone who I considered to be like family because I was too busy during the week to order online. That person did not even bother to call to wish me well despite knowing what's happened.

1l4dnl2,HearingLoss,Why don't ENTs address hidden hearing loss?,"For context, I had an acoustic trauma in mid December via a blast of loud audio in a rental car (probably around 105/110db). Within a few days, I developed distorted and muffled hearing, hearing loss, aural fullness and pain the radiated down into the base of the jaw/beginning of the neck. 

I couldn't get into anyone that specialized in hearing until 3 weeks later where an audiogram revealed mild SNHL in my left ear, and I was prescribed prednisone 60mg for two weeks, the second week being a taper. 

The prednisone didn't really do anything, and I was left with a constant deadened/plugged feeling in the left ear. Music sounded so bad and almost mono to me that I basically stopped listening to it, and I also stopped going out in loud spaces because of hyperacusis. I noticed that, in public, I was having trouble differentiating which sound came from  and had trouble understanding what people were saying. Losing normal stereo and detail in sound has been like the loss of a limb for a mind that's heavily organized around detail and richness in sound. 

It took basically 5 months before sound quality started improving and where my brain/ears became habituated around whatever occurred structurally in the inner ear. Literally just as I felt like I was turning a corner in the healing process, I was listening to music in my car at a louder but non-painful volume of around 85db.

By the time I got home, my hearing was significantly reduced, sound was distorted, both ears were plugged, and I developed a noticeable tinnitus where I really didn't have that after the initial trauma. I've also realized that I can't understand what people are saying among noise, especially when their voices drop off in pitch or volume. All in all, my symptoms have been worse and more aggressive than compared to the original post-traumatic state.  

After about a week of what I was hoping was a ""setback"" or ""flare"" or ""spike"" (language I've seen on reddit), the pressure in my ears became overwhelming and distracting, so I went to urgent care where I was prescribed another ""burst"" of prednisone, 40mg for 7 days, no taper. It didn't really do anything which was disconcerting to me. Some days have been worse than other with the worse days of extreme pressure causing a sensation that my head is going to implode/explode with light disorientation/dizziness. 

A couple days ago, I went back to an ENT I had consulted with previously and he ordered another audiogram which revealed normal hearing in both ears. It wasn't really a relief to get those results considering my capacity to hear and the quality of sound is worse than ever, as is the fullness and pressure which can become very distracting and painful. 

He made no mention of the concept of hidden hearing loss and his only theoretical opinion was that the ears are sensitized due to the original trauma. He said otherwise that I could have a speech recognition disorder and should maybe consult with a neurologist. 

Why is the phenomenon of hidden hearing loss clinically disregarded? 

Has anyone else been in my situation and if so, what did you do? How did you recover?

Blood tests: **low levels of ferritin, folate and B12, vitamin D deficiency, positive ANA**.

All of this has devastated me. I went to a psychiatrist who told me that my symptoms were a consequence of chronic stress and prescribed me **Lexapro (10mg)**. I've been taking it for about 25 days but I'm still feeling bad about the hearing issue. I also took **Clonazepam** to sleep (which I'm now starting to taper off) and started a cycle of supplements: **Argivit, B-complex vitamins, Magnesium L-Threonate and Turmeric extract with black pepper**.

I saw an ENT again, the audiogram up to 8kHz remained unchanged from last time, but now I have much more **difficulty understanding what people are saying**, especially if they're not facing directly toward me and if there's background noise (**hidden hearing loss** / **cochlear synaptopathy**?). When I swallow I hear ""clicks"" in my ears (**eustachian tube dysfunction**?).

I went to a neurologist, he told me it's not long COVID and prescribed an electroencephalogram, ABR and MRI for the auditory nerve. I haven't done them yet.

What the hell do I have? **Noise-induced hearing loss**? **COVID-induced**? **Permanent or reversible**? **Long COVID** or just **chronic stress** and **mononucleosis**? Is anyone else in my same situation? I can live with the other symptoms, but not with **hearing loss**, social situations have become horrible, I was a fast talker and I had very powerful social skills that now disappeared.

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.

**Thanks everyone**.

I have a similar story as yours but without Noise exposure. I think in my case either Hidden hearing loss or stress. But honestly I dont know. I'm in a psychosomatic clinic right now specializing in tinnitus and even they cant pinpoint what it is despite tinnitus.  Is there anything new in your case?",2025-06-05 13:04:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l3yo41/a_really_strange_case_please_help_me_understand/
1l3rbxf,HearingLoss,Worse hearing without hearing loss?,"Hi everyone,  
  
I think I developed tinnitus in both ears, although it is mostly on the right side, after attending a loud concert about a month ago. At first, I did not really notice it, so, like an idiot, I went to two more concerts, about two weeks apart. I kept using ear protection, so I thought I was safe.  
  
Well, for the last two weeks, the ringing has been pretty unbearable and I also got the impression I cant hear as well on the right side. I went to an ENT a week ago, but he did not seem to care much. My audiogram looked perfect, so he just told me to let my ears heal. They only tested up to 8 kHz, so who knows if I have hearing damage in the higher frequencies.  
  
I went to another ENT yesterday. The same audiogram showed no hearing loss. I think they tested up to 8 kHz again, but I am not sure. Anyway, he prescribed me Cortisone for 10 days, starting with 100 mg for the first three days, then tapering off.  
  
Now I am extremely torn. Is this all in my head? Can you actually hear worse with a perfect audiogram? 



Also the ringing is making me feel deeply depressed, but the potential side effects of Cortisone also seem pretty extreme.

pretty well. Honestly curious—anyone else in the same boat? Just because you’ve got

1l2saci,HearingLoss,Can hearing loss be hereditary?,"My paternal grandmother wore hearing aids as long as I can remember. My dad has worn hearing aids since he was in his mid-thirties. I’m almost 34 and I’ve noticed recently that I really struggle to hear a conversation if there is any kind of background noise. 

For example, if I’m talking to someone and there is any kind of fan, dishwasher or lawn mower etc audible in the background, I struggle to make out what the person who is talking to me is saying. Is this normal at my age, or could it possibly be a sign that I may be facing hearing loss?’

[댓글]
I (60F) just had a comprehensive test with an ENT and I have genetic hearing loss in the same ear as my parent had. Doc told genetic hearing loss is a thing that exists. She said I'll struggle to make out what someone is saying when there's a lot of background noise. I don't know if it's ""normal"" at your age, I can't hardly think it is, so I would see an ENT and get evaluated if possible. The one thing she told me is to use an ear plug in my bad ear to preserve my hearing and protect it from loud noises. If I could go back in time I would certainly protect my ears better!

I have genetic hearing loss from my father's side. Funny thing is, its random who it chooses. My sister from the same father has no hearing issues and mine are severe. It goes back generations.

I just found out this past week that I have hereditary hearing loss. I'm 47, my hearing loss started at 42. I'm moderate to severe mixed with sensorineural hearing loss in both ears.  I've been wearing hearing aids for 3 years.

Yes, it can be genetic that you can inherit. Unfortunately.

Yes, I sought treatment at the youngest age though in my early 30s.

Look up amblyaudia.  I had the same symptoms and got my hearing tested.  Normal in quiet environments, failed 50% of the tests with background noise.  There are online audio tools to help re-train your brain.

I have hearing issues and so does my older sister.

My father and his father wore hearing aids in their 60s. I started losing mine around age 40. It continued to deteriorate until I was deaf in one ear and moderate in the other. No one else had hearing problems. I'm deafer than my family history, though. Grandpa and Dad wore only 1 hearing aid well into their 80s.

Thank you everyone for your input! I really appreciate it. I’ll go to Costco this weekend to get my hearing tested.",2025-06-04 00:42:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l2saci/can_hearing_loss_be_hereditary/

1l2n6d3,HearingLoss,Help,"One thing that bothers me the most is the fact that I lost my ""physical integrity"". Having been diagnosed with mild hearing loss and tinnitus three months ago (at the age of 22), I have a hard time accepting that the thing I valued most in life (my health, especially cognition and my senses) start to fade. How did you guys manage to come to terms with this personal limitation in life, cause I'm really loosing my mind over it. 

[댓글]
Yeah it’s a mind fuck for sure. Especially at your age. I didn’t have to face it until I was in my early 50s. But I’m 55 now and thanks ti covid and other things it’s gone way downhill and I feel like an invalid

I am an audiophile, a DJ and simply someone for whom the sound around me is not just noise. I heard my wife sneaking up on me as quietly as possible from behind, walking in soft slippers on a velvet carpet. I simply heard the change in the sound space around me.

 Several years ago, my hearing began to deteriorate. And now I often can’t even say exactly from which side a particular sound comes. I have completely stopped enjoying music. And these facts bring me deep disappointment. I still hope that I will somehow get used to this new perception. And even more I want to live to see the time when hearing will be properly treated. But for now, I need to live one day. And so every day. The brain must adapt.

Yes being young and having to imagine your whole life being like this, and potentially getting worse, is frightening. I’m 30 years old and just got diagnosed with Cochlear Hydrops which can essentially make me go deaf in both my ears. At the moment it’s only my right ear and luckily my hearing seems to be getting better. Just 3 months ago I suddenly had hearing loss which was down was in the severe hearing loss range. Now I have to spend the rest of my life wondering if I’ll go deaf in my right ear and will it migrate to my left ear. I’ve decided I’ll just deal with it when the time comes. To worry about that now just steals any joy I have at the moment. What a waste. Don’t let this suck the joy out of your life.

Congratulations! On making it to the old age of 22 before being diagnosed with hearing loss.  I found out when I was 5 years old.  It is normal to mourn a change.  But on the other hand it isn't the end of the world.  Being relatively young, you are more adaptable than someone who is older.  

Sometimes, if you have conductive hearing loss, they can do surgery.  There are hearing aids to help with hearing loss and the tinnitus.  The ones they have now are quite amazing.  


With time, I think the stats are 80% of people experience hearing loss as they age.  But, I've had fluctuating hearing my entire life.  That's been my normal.  Also, I'm much more adapted to hearing visually than someone with adult onset.

I'm old (70). I was fine with my hearing loss for 20 years with hearing aids. Then, I suddenly lost all the hearing in one ear, leaving me 1 ear that was moderately deaf. I was in denial. I'm still HoH in my head  Now, I was ""actually"" deaf. I had a hard time wrapping my head around the fact of it. I had begun withdrawing from family gatherings. I couldn't understand words. Eight months ago, I started exploring cochlear implant for my deaf ear. In that time period, I finally was able to call myself deaf. That HoH was a long time ago for me. Simply put, I accepted it and am doing something about it.

I went through that for the first time when I was about 17 and was diagnosed with a autoimmune disease. 

It IS devastating to realize your body has 'failed' you. I coped by utilizing talk therapy, Journaling, and using social media to connect with other people who had the same diagnosis.

Hi sender, I lost my hearing in my left ear when I was 14 years old. I got mumps that weren't treated immediately. Had I known back then that the viral infection causing mumps can make me deaf, I should have faced my social anxiety and sought medical help as soon as possible but life has a different twist so here I am now trying harder everyday to stop regretting the past. 

Everyday for 2 years since the day I lost my hearing on my left ear, I cried hard every time I was alone.. at school, at home, at night.. especially at night.. I never stopped hoping and praying to have my hearing back. I can't function right. I can't locate sounds, I can't understand what other people were saying because of the tinnitus that kept on ringing in my head like loud crickets.. it's depressing.. sooo irritating. Triggers my anxiety every time.. Thankfully I didn't burst or breakdown in public. But I do when I'm alone. I hated being alone at that time.. but needed it at the same time. I felt like I've lost everything.. I feared tomorrow and the future was so scary for me.

I used to be full of dreams, plans and goals that I follow religiously before. And just like that, I suddenly don't know  how to continue and where to start again. I felt that I've become dumber.. I used to be an academic achiever who could easily understand any lesson but now I can't comprehend a simple mathematical problem I used to enjoy before. I feared my tomorrow. I lost my dreams.

But life has to be lived. Every experience teaches us something, and learning and being better are important components of life. One thing that turns me back to my senses is when I see other people who are really disabled that keep on trying their hardest everyday just to survive another day even though they live very hard lives. They still try to survive and gurl, they can still laugh and be happy. How can they be so in love with their lives that they refuse to die even if they seemed to live a torturing life? It made me rethink my pain. 

One day I woke up, I decided to accept my fate and live the life I have. I started my first day a few morning jumping jacks and stationary exercises. Plan my day ahead by writing down my to-do list for the day in one page of my personal notebook and long term projects on another. Then I proceed for the day, trying to live as normal as before. As the night comes, I keep myself busy jotting down what transpired during the day, and evaluate myself on how I can get better or do better next time. I solve problems and memorize formulas to exercise my brain.  I still cry at night but as I adapt to my reality, this slowly fades as time goes by.

It's been 3 years since. My mother finally had enough money. She took me for the first time to an audiologist and had me checked. Sensory neural hearing lost on the left ear. Right ear, mild. Treatment, CROSS bone conduction hearing aid. How much? 200,000. My heart sunk. I look at my mother. Her eyes were so lonely. 200,000, the only money of our family. That's all that my mother has. I'm studying engineering. My brother was still in college also. My sister was still in elementary. My father just lost his job. I can't be emotional. I told my mother to not worry about it anymore. I will buy my own hearing aid when I get to work.

It's been 13 years since I lost my hearing. I'm now an engineer, working in my first permanent job but still haven't earned enough for that hearing aid. Inflation hits hard on poor people like me. Even though, I survived more than a decade sender. I chose to continue and was able to. 

Get medical help as soon as possible. Wear hearing aids if you must. Your strength is in your head. It was really very hard initially, but if you choose to move forward, your body will adapt to the changes. Pray and help yourself. Yours was still mild. That may still be treated or corrected by hearing aids.. You can overcome that sender... I'm rooting for you 💚

I think we go through the different mourning fazes when something big happens in are lives especially an illness and in time it will get better but you just can’t let it rule your life too much.

I can understand that feeling especially being newly diagnosed with hearing loss.

The constant buzzing is the most annoying thing. It never goes away. I'm 5 years in with a diagnosis. I am 47. Sensorineural in both ears moderate to severe cookie bite. Mid range is anywhere from 500 when I begin to lose it to 4000 Hz when I can hear it better.  One ear I can hear higher pitched sounds better than in the other. I'm still trying to read up on it as much as I can. 

I kind of started noticing something was off maybe in my 30s, but if I stood closer to people or turned the TV up it was fine. Fast forward to 42...I felt this huge wave of pressure in my left ear, at work of all places, and I couldn't hear anything for what seemed like more than a few minutes. 

Once that happened I went to the ENT  and saw an audiologist and eventually got hearing aids. My tympanometry came out normal each year and blood tests did not show up anything unusual. It was my audiograms that were way off. With this information, it felt like a weight came off. 

With my hearing aids, the tinnitus is manageable. It's not totally gone. My balance is better. My conversations are smoother. There's less what, huh, uh yea sure. I know my hearing will get worse, but I'm hoping I have a few years before it starts to fluctuate.

You need to have an audiogram. There are so many proper diagnoses before having an autism as one. 

You likely have some form of hearing loss, with proper hearing aids there's a chance you can have your life back.

Sorry to hear that. But i am in the same boat and I have been suffering this for over 18 years. Doctors  said mine is called auditory neuropathy and it is uncure. Hearings aids cannot help for they cannot make the sound or speech clear.  It’s really hard  but glory to Jah God who help me endure. Nowadays I tend to not focus too much on my situation so I do not get depressed.  Despide this problem, I managed to get to college and  got  a2 bachelor degrees: One from my come country and the other from the US.  But I do not get recruited .

Ok I read the whole thing. If youre in a 3rd wolrd country you might be suprised how easier it is to see a doc. Make it a priority and dont think that just because pain left it means that the hearing loss will resolve (even if that what i hope for you).

Sudden hearing loss can be caused by :
-a virus/infection that attacks internal ear cells resulting in permanent damage if untreated quickly

-bloodflow problem that causes the cells to not be oxygenated enough and die if not treated in 2 days 

-acoustic neurinoama (benign) or actual cancer mass, hence the need of a scan.

-just fluid behind the eardrum (otitis/otitas media effusion) which can take 3 months to resolve but i would take that chance (i got that diagnosis and did nothing at first which is why im now at the permanent hearing loss diagnosis...)

Best of luck

Doctor here. 


What you need to do is to run to an ER. See a doctor now. Sudden hearing loss is a medical emergency. Insist on seeing ENT ASAP.

I didnt read all cause honestly ive been going through this the past month and I want to answer asap. All I learned is that the best thing to do if its sudden, is go to urgent care, no audiologist no ENT (takes month to see) go to urgent care and ask for head scan and steroids (oral or ear injection). I wish i did that. Apparently in 48h you can reverse wtv you got but past that its less likely to do anything.

Go to an ER asap.  

I had the same thing happen to me. I have a ton of sinus issues and I just assumed the hearing loss was a sinus infection.  Waited 2 weeks to see my ENT thinking it was nothing.  

I have mod to severe hearing loss in that ear and tinnitus.  Both are likely permanent and I now have a hearing aid for that ear.",2025-06-03 16:05:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l2fstx/left_ear_hearing_loss_for_3_days_possibly_sinus/

1l23r4m,HearingLoss,"[SSNHL] Sudden Low-Frequency Hearing Loss + Tinnitus -&gt; 2 weeks, no Improvement, scared","Hi everyone,

Two weeks ago (the night of May 17), I suddenly lost hearing in my left ear. I was out at a restaurant with music when I gradually noticed I couldn’t hear properly. The next day I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with **sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL)** and started immediately prednisone.

Initially it felt just like muffled clogged ear, but a day or two later, I developed constant tinnitus, like a deep air tunnel, plane white noise, which hasn’t gone away since. It’s honestly exhausting. I can’t sleep well, watch tv, do anything really, can't tell where sounds come from and emotionally I’m really exhausted and struggling.

**Diagnosis :**

* SSNHL, possibly due to endolymphatic hydrops (excess inner ear fluid causing pressure)
* Audiogram shows moderately severe low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear, sloping upward toward normal hearing at higher frequencies (4–8 kHz)

**Treatments** (i'm in France):

* Prednisone : 60 mg/day for 3 days, then 80 mg/day for 6 days → Now fully tapered off
* 3 ear injections : days 6, 10, and 11
* Mannitol perfusions: days 10 and 11
* Lasix (diuretic)
* Valacyclovir (antiviral): Started day 9 to 15 (in case of viral origin like herpes)

It’s now **Day 16** and… **no improvement so far**.  
I'm doing everything the doctors prescribed, but I'm still not hearing from that ear, and the tinnitus hasn’t changed at all. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but I'm honestly feeling really anxious and afraid.

I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s been through this:

* How long did it take to notice any improvement?
* Is it normal for tinnitus not to change at all at this stage?
* Did anyone experience a delayed recovery like after 2 or 3 weeks?
* Did you recover partially or fully?

This has taken a big emotional toll. And I understand that the longer it takes, the lower my chances of recovery ...  My next Dr appointment is in one week, for the MRI and an additional ear injection, so nothing between days 11 and 21 .... Is this normal ?? Thank u ! 🙏

My loss was severe across all frequencies. happened on March 16, admitted on 3rd day and took treatment for 10 days straight and one ear injection, that's it. i was discharged and given a tablet for blood flow and a multivitamin. 

during the 1st week, no improvement at all infact it showed a little further decline. 2nd week a slight improvement and they discharged me. then i went to check back on 4th week, there was more improvement. 

In my case i recovered most of my hearing in the first 30 days. i went for a hearing test on day 60 which showed the same result as day 30. now my loss is moderate to severe in 3k, 4k and 8k frequencies. doctor told me higher frequencies are very rare to recover and only time will tell. 

your's is opposite and you have normal hearing in high frequency which is good. keep your hopes up

and you should definitely try constraint induced sound therapy (CIST).

I had profound loss across all frequencies. I’m on my 2nd shot, after oral prednisone.  It has “improved” from profound to severe…

They gave you lasix during an ssnhl? They should've prescribed a thiazide diuretic not Lasix.  Lasix is a known ototoxic agent. 
Check with your doctor urgently. 

The rest seems OK, I'd argue against mannitol but might make sense alright. 

You don't start valacyclovir at 10th day unless you see herpes vesicules openly.

Anyway,

Drop salt, caffeine and alcohol completely at least 3 months. Ask the doctor for betahistine 24 mg 3x1 and change your doctor. See another ENT.


Advise your doctor to check uptodate from time to time. I don't think he knows what he's doing",2025-06-03 05:17:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l23r4m/ssnhl_sudden_lowfrequency_hearing_loss_tinnitus_2/
1l1wigl,HearingLoss,Introductory post!!!,"Hello I began to notice my hearing getting a bit bad 2 years ago when I was 18 I went to see a doctor about it and they said there was a build up of hard wax in one of my ears and that I needed to use drops for a few weeks and then get my ears syringed 

I done exactly as the doctor told me I put the drops in twice a day in the effected ear and then got my ear syringed in specsavers as I couldn’t get an appointment in my local doctors after I had my ears syringed the audiologist did a hearing test on me my results showed severe to profound hearing loss 

I went back to my doctors and explained the situation they sent a referral to a hospital near me to be seen by a specialist I was eventually seen about 4 months later they did more hearing tests  the results still the same I was brought back down to the hospital three times and had more hearing tests no signs of improvement in the results 

The hospital booked me in for an MRI Scan I had that last year the results showed a blockage in my sinus I was told to use sprays and different things to unblock my sinus it didn’t work in around November 2024 I seen a specialist about hearing aids they did tests and I got my hearing aids in January this year they haven’t had the effect they were supposed to and the specialist said I need cochlear Implants I’ve been put on the waiting list for Cochlear Implant Surgery which is a year long to this day my Diagnosis is Bilateral Profound Hearing loss 2 years on still in the same situation and no answers as to what happened or caused me to lose my hearing ",2025-06-02 23:03:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l1wigl/introductory_post/

1l1s3f8,HearingLoss,Introductory Post :-),"Hi, saw that we should introduce ourselves in the sub, so wanted to say hello! 

My hearing loss was diagnosed when I was 13 years old after being treated for stage 4 ovarian cancer, and is high frequency hearing loss caused by chemical nerve damage from the chemotherapy. I'm 60% deaf in my left ear, and 40% deaf in my right ear. I've not had the opportunity to try hearing aides, as at the time I was told they wouldn't specifically help my type of hearing loss without amplifying background noise as well, (which makes it even harder to hear from the amplified low frequency tones(like fans, traffic, etc) drowning out the higher frequency ones), so I mainly read lips and have to work to piece together sounds in order to figure out what I'm hearing. I was advised by the audiology team at BC Children's hospital that I would have to work at reading lips and active listening, so that's what I do!💁

My biggest struggle and frustration is the amount of people who either argue, like ""nah, you're just messing around! you can hear just fine half the time!"" or make fun of it, like saying""What?"" or ""Huh?"" in an ignorant voice when I tell them I'm deaf. Most people wouldn't walk around mocking and arguing with people in wheelchairs, so I don't understand why ***This disability*** deserves to be made fun of according to them😞 I really don't. It makes life a massive challenge most of the time(especially during pandemic times with masks and plexi glass between me and customer service people🤦) and I've been dealing with it since I was a kid, so I just don't see how that's funny to people.

So just wanted to say hi and hopefully we can support eachother here instead of making life even harder.🫶 Cheers!

I have had chronic ear issues for 29 years. I had tubes in my ears as an infant to drain fluid from chronic ear infections. My left ear has been the more affected ear my entire life. My hearing has been impaired my entire life because of this recurring issue. I don’t know what the fuck is going on. FML 🤦🏼‍♂️

Go see an ENT and have them take a look.

1l115wr,HearingLoss,Sudden hearing loss - is a second opinion worth it?,"Hi, I (25M) just got diagnosed with sudden hearing loss (idk the specifics cause im still waiting for the full report) by an audiologist. A sudden buzzing sound started in my left ear nearly 2 months ago and coincidentally after using Qtips for the first time in months. Then it got worse, hurt a bit,  felt pressure in the ear, couldn't hear well. It was sensitive to dish washing etc. I went to a nurse practitioner who told me i had liquid behind the eardrum, gave me sinus rinses and antibiotics. Didn't resolve, so I booked an audio consult.

Audiologist says its idiopathic and permanent (because untreated in 48h). The tinnitus is very loud, but the hearing loss isn't that bad imo. Anyway I was wondering if I should go see an ENT or get a second opinion. Would love to hear stories where the second opinion made a difference. Cheers

Get oral or intratympanic steroid treatment ASAP and an MRI.

Get a 2nd opinion, sounds like Otitis Media with Effusion, I too was diagnosed as sudden hearing loss by my first ENT, but turns out I had fluid in my middle ear by my 2nd ENT after doing tympanogram.

If the onset of this hearing loss was sudden she should have sent you for an MRI to rule out any kind of tumor

Have you tried taking a Zyrtec?

If you haven’t yet get prednisone immediately!!!!!!!!!!! Within 3 days of onset

1l0g48i,HearingLoss,"Can you hear the ""emotion""?","I have had high-frequency hearing loss (6k-8k) and Tinnitus at the same time in my left ear since I was 17, while my right ear is normal.

This year, when I was 32, I started wearing a hearing aid. When I wear it, I feel like I can hear the emotions of the other person, sense their current state, and connect with them to some extent. However, when I remove the hearing aid, this ability disappears.


Do you experience this?

[댓글]
Yes, with hearing aids and amplified sounds, you get to feel the heaviness or lightness of the other person's voice. Their trying too hard to speak or speaking too softly also comes into your notice. With frequent use of HAs, you get to adjust to people speaking in different tones too. You focus on others and their way of talking and are involved in communication.
Removing HAs removes you entirely from the experience of various sounds, moving traffic, sounds of footsteps, chirping birds and people going about their day etc. It just feels blank and in that state, all your focus turns to own emotions, you feel too much sitting silently not hearing anything.

I was always told that because my hearing loss is in the high frequency range, that hearing aids wouldn't help me, so I don't know tbh, but what the other comment said about being able to focus differently and that adding up to missed experiences makes a lot of sense to me, because I have to work twice as hard to listen to the words someone says (and either read their lips or ""piece the sounds back together"") so it takes *All* my focus to actively listen to them, so there's a high likelihood that I'm missing out on voice tone which would add the emotion level that you're talking about. 

I'm pretty in tune to begin with tho, and find that paying attention to emotional context makes it easier to ""hear"", ie ""figure out"", what a person is saying, so even when they aren't speaking I'm still paying attention to mood and such, so it's hard to guess at the difference ha's would make in that department for me.

1l05hye,HearingLoss,I can * almost * hear them - but is it real?,"I have a portable air conditioner that I use and of course its pretty noisy when its running. I've been noticing when it is on, I hear what sounds like a far off conversation. I can pick up maybe a few words but I can never understand exactly what is being said. It seems to come from multiple directions but not necessarily all directions. I try to chase it down, find the origin, but I can't pin it down to any one spot. It sounds like full on conversations with inflection and emotion and more than one person. Sometimes male and female - clearly distinct. However, if I turn the AC off so that it is quieter in the room and then listen to find where the voices are coming from, I can no longer hear them or it is even harder to hear them - which makes zero sense. I noticed even between putting my over hear head phones on and taking them off, when on I can hear the voices again (nothing playing the headphones, just putting it over my ears). When I take them off, I don't hear the voices as well. 

  
It's driving me insane! My mind concocts the stories about what I think I am hearing and its quiet stressful. Thinking Im hearing neighbors being kidnapped or attacked or thinking someone is talking about something I've done wrong with my apartment. It's all nonsensical. Now part of that results from my own anxiety in general, but the hearing part, I think that is a different problem. To be clear - I'm saying I don't think its related to a mental health disorder. 

  
Could the voices and the connection to loud noise (it also happens with the bathroom fan running) be related to some form of hearing loss?

[댓글]
You should get your hearing checked by an audiologist. They recommend visiting an ENT first to make sure your ears are clean of wax.

I have moderately severe hearing loss and I will absolutely imagine I'm hearing something, like voices or music in a fan. Thinking I hear music is very common. It doesn't really bother me anymore, I just accept that it happens sometimes. I'm not hearing voices telling me to commit crimes.

I wear earplugs at night, there are two benefits. One is that it blocks out the sound of the fan, and the other is that I know for sure a sound is coming from inside my head instead of being real, actual noise. I have smoke detectors that light up — plus family and a dog — so I don't worry about not hearing a fire alarm.

A very curious situation. From the description it sounds like auditory hallucinations. 

I don't know about your case, but sometimes something similar happens to me with the ear that hears worse: if I'm outside and hear swifts flying low, then when I come home I can still hear the sound of birds in my weak ear for a long time. Although I clearly understand that these sounds cannot be in the apartment. 

As for your case, I would try the following: I would take a high-quality microphone, record the sound of the air conditioner, and then play the recording through headphones and try to hear strange voices there. If the voices can be heard repeatedly and with confidence, then with the help of computer processing you can try to emphasize these voices and try to hear what they are saying. If the voices change each time when you play them again, then these are your mind games. Try to just accept it as it is. The brain sometimes does very amazing things.",2025-05-31 19:33:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l05hye/i_can_almost_hear_them_but_is_it_real/
1l04v63,HearingLoss,Sudden high and low frequency hearing loss in left ear: searching for answers,"Hello! I am 23 years old, and two weeks ago I woke up the morning before an international flight, after a couple nights of really poor sleep. I have had pretty mild but noticeable tinnitus for ages due to noise exposure (musician), but when I woke up this morning, the tinnitus in my left ear was much louder and changing in pitch. I took the flight (maybe this was stupid), and since then I have lost a lot of clarity and detail in my left ear. There was also an evening where I was losing my balance while walking, and have felt pressure and mild pain in my left ear. I could not see an ENT while I was away, but the three GP doctors I saw found no indication of an ear infection or wax buildup.  

I only came across advice to take Predinsone 2 weeks into having symptoms, but began taking it at a high dose as soon as I found out it is recommended. Is there anything else I should be doing right now in the meantime, before I see an ENT this week? Anyone have a similar experience, or suggestion of causes? Thanks!

I have seen in your and other posts that Prednisone is prescribed for  inflammation? I wasn't prescribed anything at the beginning so just wondering. If you have already been to the ENT, what did they tell you? A lot of what you are describing I have experienced...the balance issues, the sudden loss of hearing, pressure and pain. My experience started 5 years ago with the sudden loss of hearing. I am 47.  As a classroom teacher, it was getting harder to understand the students, and one day while giving a test one-on-one, I got this weird funky feeling of fullness in my ear and then nothing. Fast forward...I am diagnosed as moderate to severe mixed with sensorineural hearing loss in both ears from 500- 4000K Hz. Otherwise known as cookie bite. I have been wearing hearing aids for 3 years and it helps a lot.

I would try a Zyrtec to see if it’s allergy related.",2025-05-31 19:05:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1l04v63/sudden_high_and_low_frequency_hearing_loss_in/

1kzonkz,HearingLoss,Envoy Esteem Implant,"I was surprised to find that there isn’t a dedicated Reddit thread about this, but here I am writing it. I recently looked into alternative solutions for severe unilateral hearing loss beyond traditional hearing aids and came across the Esteem, a fully implantable hearing device. Although it’s not super common in the US, reading about it felt like finding a potential cure for hearing loss. Everything I read about it was positive, so I’d love to hear some critiques of it. If anyone has had or has the Esteem, please share your experience.

[댓글]
The device is very specific. Hearing involves many variables that can fail. You can't just say that the Envoy Esteem will cure everything.

The hair cells, the cochlear synapse, or the auditory nerve could be impaired. Without proper tests or clear symptoms, it's unlikely you'll know exactly what's failing.

Personally, I'd bet more on future cochlear implants with more electrodes — likely to come in the next decade — than on a device that only works in very specific situations",2025-05-31 04:39:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kzonkz/envoy_esteem_implant/
1kzntyk,HearingLoss,Wife down playing my diagnosis,"Tl;dr I have been diagnosed with moderate hearing loss in left ear and mild in right ear. My wife is down playing it every step of the way as insignificant. How can i help her understand that yeah i do have some actual hearing loss that is affecting my life.

I have visited the same ENT twice a year to have my ears cleaned out for about the past 10 years. This a result of my family doctor telling me not to use cotton swabs and then ENT saying the same.

I had to schedule with a different ENT in March because my usual doctor was apparently booked out a month and my ears felt very clogged.

So I visited this new doctor and after they did their thing asked me when the last time my previous doctor did a hearing test. I had never had a hearing test at my previous ENT. 

This doctor was very surprised and suggested we do one so that we have a baseline for where I am currently at.

So I went and sat in a booth with headphones doing the hand raising thing when I heard a sound. After that I was asked to repeat the word that the tech was saying which was VERY difficult. 

Seems I didn't do to well. I was told that I have moderate hearing loss in my left ear and mild loss in my right ear. I also went and had an MRI which I have yet to return and discuss the results. 

I didn't ask anywhere near enough questions as the doctor met me with me to discuss the results. All I know is that I have moderate loss in one and mild in the other. Seems the higher frequencies are where I am most deficient. 

Driving home I was reflecting on.....hearing things. I often have to ask people to repeat things. Especially if they aren't close to me or my left side is facing them. 

Which brings me to the title of my post. In between the cleaning, test and post-test I was texting my wife that they were doing hearing tests and the reason for doing so. I ultimately texted her during the visit that I apparently had some moderate and mild hearing loss. She did not respond to that other than ""that sucks"". 

Any time that I mention it she says my hearing seems fine, while I continue to recognize more and more of WHAT I've actually lost. 

Fast forward to today. My 47th birthday and my family got me my requested Openrun Pro 2 bone conduction headphones. I love music oh so much and immediately abolished earbuds at the recommendation of my doctor. I was very grateful and further explained to my daughter why I wanted these. This was quickly followed by my wife saying ""Please you're treating this like a disability"". 

Since my visit she has never asked about the diagnosis and clearly thinks that nothing is wrong. She is usually a very loving and caring woman which makes her reaction, or lack of a reaction...very puzzling. 

Im trying to help her understand what I am experiencing but dont know how. She knows that I often have to ask people to repeat themselves her included. But she totally wont acknowledge this and its so frustrating. 

All of this rambling. How can I help her understand? Im not looking for sympathy from her. I just want her to acknowledge that yeah something is wrong.

Hearing loss, if it meets a certain criteria, is absolutely a disability. I was diagnosed with bilateral moderate sensorineural hearing loss this year. I am 41. My family still does not speak up or look at me when they are talking to me and get frustrated with me when I ask them to repeat themselves. I think because hearing loss is invisible to others who do not experience it, they cannot comprehend how debilitating and depressing it is to not have their support and not be able to hear the people we want to hear. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Hopefully after sharing more about the hearing loss with your family they will better understand how to help you as you navigate these changes.

I have the same as you (mild in one ear, moderate in the other) diagnosed earlier this year. I have noticed since my diagnosis that I am more aware of how much I struggle.

People assume that it’s just a volume adjustment but I also can’t hear certain sounds so I am constantly trying to figure out what people are saying. Which is exhausting. My therapist told me that I should be able to hear completely fine now I have my hearing aids and I had to explain to them that they are aids, not cures and that even with them, my life is much harder than it was before. It’s a recognised disability but because I look fine, people assume I am fine and not that I am struggling to operate in their hearing world.

I am adjusting and things are getting easier. But I am also choosing isolation more because it’s just easier than not hearing people.

I have very similar feelings to you and I’m sorry you’re going through this. I don’t have advice but you’re not alone in feeling this way.

OP that’s not normal at all. I have moderately-severe hearing loss in both ears and told my husband when we had only been dating a couple months. He has always taken it seriously and tries to make accommodations for me all the time.

Maybe time to have a sit-down chat with her about it?

Your spouse’s reaction is inexcusable. I wonder if she is in denial to make herself somehow feel better about it. Like if she just acts like it’s not a big deal, it magically won’t be. 

I’m terribly sorry that your life partner isn’t being supportive. I am 38 years old and have moderate to severe hearing loss in the high frequencies. I definitely mourned and was super sad about it, but my life has massively improved since I’ve gotten hearing aids. 

I think it would be beneficial for you to sit down with your wife and tell her that it’s been extremely hurtful not to have her support and to actually have her gaslighting your feelings and minimizing them.


This is absolutely a disability. Now that I have hearing aids, I can’t believe that I went so long without them. It was so exhausting constantly having to try to lip read and figure out through context clues what people were saying. 

My husband has noticed that I’m a lot more vibrant in social situations, and no doubt it’s because I don’t have to struggle just to understand what others are saying. To say this isn’t a disability is pretty cruel.

I wish you luck.

This sucks. Gather all your thoughts and feelings and sit down with her at a neutral time. She doesn’t get to decide if it’s a big deal to you or not. Losing your hearing is something you will need to grieve, even if it never progresses. It’s a really hard thing to go through!! And you are obviously still processing it and need support. I hope she will come around and be there for you in this.

It’s hard to appreciate what it’s like to have a hearing loss until you experience it yourself. It’s an “invisible” disability.

Are you considering hearing aids?

I’m sorry to hear that your wife doesn’t respect your diagnosis. My son has mild to moderate hearing loss, and we had no idea that he was having issues hearing us other than coming home from preschool very angry and tired (he was having hearing fatigue). We would think he was just very focused when he wouldn’t hear us talking to him, but he couldn’t differentiate some sounds from my wife and I talking to him. 

If she doesn’t respect your diagnosis, take her with you to your appointment when you see an audiologist. When my son got his first hearing aids, the audiologist played for us typical sounds that were filtered with his hearing loss. It was heartbreaking how a little girl talking sounded muffled, and how birds didn’t sound very loud or distinct. Once he put them in, he could hear rain outside (I couldn’t even hear it), what his voice sounded like when he talked, and the chime from my wife’s phone. This might show your wife how different your hearing is from hers.

Maybe, this is just an assumption, you having a hearing loss is too confronting for her that you are getting older and starting to have health issues and she goes into some cognitive denial state. In general women have a harder time with accepting aging then men do. It is no excuse to behave like her but maybe thats the root of the problem. 

When my husband is injured or has health issues I always become very distant and harsh while I'm normally in general a nice and caring person. But if it comes too close I shut down completely because I dont know how to cope with emotions that are paired with sickness, injuries and loss. Sucks for him, especially since he is really caring for me. 

But even though he is very caring, he doesn't always take my hearing loss in account. Not because he doesn't care, but because he just don't know how it is to have a hearing loss. I think its very special of your co-workers that they do think about it because most people, like someone posted also in this thread, just don't care or forget all the time.

So even after you had a talk with your wife and when she acknowledge it, don't expect her to talk louder or more in your face, because it is an invisible disability.

People have downplayed my hearing loss my entire life. But for your own spouse to be the one doing it , that's so rough. That's very F'ed up. I hope she stops acting like that.

If you went and got hearing aids and she saw how much it benefitted you, maybe she would get it. Costco is great if you're on a budget and/or insurance will not pay for it. I have similar hearing loss as you and hearing aids were a game changer.

I get that a lot with my 4 year old daughter [mild-moderate high frequency hearing loss] that ""Oh but she seems fine!"" Or ""We don't see any trouble with her hearing she can hear us call her name just fine!"" 🙄🙄

Hearing loss affects your life severely!!

You can’t help her understand because that would require her to care in the first place and right now she thinks your fine …just let it go and when she starts complaining that you’re ignoring her thats when you school her.

You went and had an MRI because they think you could have a brain tumor because your moderate loss is significant. I say if you haven't been called,you have no tumor. I had  the same situation. The hearing loss was notable after several bouts of COVID. What's wrong with your wife? Have her go through the day with earbuds in but off

I went through this with my first husband. He absolutely refused to acknowledge my hearing difficulties we're an impairment and eventually started making fun of me by doing fake sign language and making nonsense-sounds when I'd ask him to repeat himself. 


He refused to go to marriage counseling (we obviously had other issues aside from the hearing loss) or to even discuss that my hearing issues were a lot harder on me than he thought they should be. 


My second husband is the complete opposite. He's always made sure I have the prime-hearing spot when we go out with people and has been my greatest advocate. 


Would your wife be open to a couples counseling session o discuss this? Will she go with you to the audiologist and ask a list of questions? Your wife should be on your side, not against you.

My husband tested my hearing when we got together. He walked into a farther away room and yelled at me and realized I couldn't hear him. Tell her to do the same thing. If she doesn't believe you , oh well. That's her issue.

Well, I guess she should consider herself lucky that she hasn't noticed your hearing loss and had to adjust her way of interacting with you! Maybebthat is why she is under playing the whole thing. 

I'm glad that you got hearing aids and I'm sure they will help you. I'm sorry that your wife isn't being more supportive.  I had to get aids at age 47 and I am lucky that my husband has been understanding and supportive the past 16 years. I don't know what to tell you. I hope she develops some compassion for you.

It's a major life change. I think your reaction is actually quite tame, all things considered. I reacted poorly to just getting a prognosis, it's not even bad yet. I have no advice on getting her to understand your reaction, just validation on how you're feeling about it.

“That sucks” and I mean that-truly. I am of a similar age with a similar (but slightly worse) diagnosis. I wear hearing aids and they have made a HUGE positive difference in my life. I get very little sympathy, understanding or honestly interest from anyone about my hearing loss. It feels like it’s because of my age-about 20 years younger than what most people imaging “hard of hearing” looks like. I think that people know hearing loss is a disability, but somehow don’t want to accept or assign that term unless a person is nearly deaf. I got a lot of “well I can’t hear very well in a crowded room either” like I’m imagining my disability, or worse, “doing it to get attention” it’s super sad. In the end, I think that even the people who love us (maybe especially the people who love us) are having their own internal struggle accepting their loved one has a disability. It makes them uncomfortable. Instead of engaging and actively learning more, they ignore it all together. I try not to hold it against them, but it hurts.

I don't know, but I feel for you. I was diagnosed nearly 30 years ago as being deaf in the high frequency range(40% in one ear, and 60% in the other) and ever since I've either been made fun of for it, or had people act like it's not real. I don't know what to say because this is your wife, because imo these people are walking pieces of 💩 for the way they treat people who have legitimate medical diagnoses, or who are disabled in general. It's a conscious choice on their part, and they have the same access to the world wide web of information, so i feel that if they cared they'd look it up on their own accord to educate themselves in how to better support you. 

But that's just my opinion, and the person is your wife, so that's a tough spot. 

Maybe literally tell her how her behavior is actually coming off, and that she's being unsupportive and it's only making things worse, and ask her why she's being like this. You say she's normally a kind person so maybe she doesn't realize it's a legitimate thing for you or how her dismissive behavior is affecting you.

edited to fix grammar.

Tbh, it’s more of a big deal to you than it is to others. 

I have mild hearing loss, and you’d think people that know me well enough would speak up at times. Nope., still the super soft voice tone. 

To everyone else it’s not a big deal. To my person, he also didn’t make a big deal. 

I’m a very strong person naturally but one day I cried about it for a few minutes. I mourned the loss of the hearing, had a few sad moments because it can be annoying to others when you Always ask what? 

And person told me basically to ‘man’ up about it. 

It was completely the wrong reaction and I explained after. 

But people don’t care about it as much as you do. 

Take your moments, mourn the loss of it, and carry on with this new discovery. Maybe you can consider getting a hearing aid for the moderate ear x 

Are the headphones you received safe for your hearing? 

Headphones at high volumes are bad for you,

Umm it’s absolutely a big deal!! I’m struggling with eustchian tube dysfunction right now and as a 33 year old woman my life has been terrible the past two months. Having my ear clogged with ear wax was the start of all of this… I woke up panicking because I couldn’t hear as well and my ear felt weird / clogged. I was forcefully popping them and doing anything to clear. Now having to do a hearing test in two weeks because the pressure inside my ears have only increased. My ears hurt every day I don’t know what to do. I jus t want to feel normal again! I’ve cried so much and I’m dreading this hearing test because I also ask people to repeat stuff and I’m nervous for what this test is going to say.

I don’t think other people can understand how you feel because they don’t have same issue. I did blame my husband not caring about my frustration but looks like all people are same, they don’t have the feeling! So just save your time and focus on yourself instead of thinking why the other person doesn’t care.",2025-05-31 03:52:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kzntyk/wife_down_playing_my_diagnosis/

You go to a doctor that's how

I just went for my first audiologist appointment, and the hearing check only took about twenty minutes. I had to get a referral from my primary care doctor, but they checked my ears, saw no wax and referred me right along. I recommend going to primary care and let them know you noticed your hearing is diminished. They can tell you if it isn’t wax and refer you out if needed. If it is wax, they can typically get it out for you or send you to ENT. The longer you let it go, the more strain you put on your brain to process speech and sound.

If you want to DIY it, there are Bluetooth cameras that have wax cleaning attachments, and they're not expensive. FOLLOW THE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. 

I suspect the crackling is due to congested sinuses though.

1kyesc4,HearingLoss,Sound quality worse in my right ear,"Recently had around 4hours sessions in AirPods Pro with little breaks between every hour, also for couple hours I’ve used ANC ( noise reduction ), it was around 39-56dB. At evening my right ear ringing, next morning I get ear drop💧in that ear, it start ringing more, after I slept ringing stopped. I’ve get few days break from headphones, both ears were easily tired from AirPods, right ear was like slightly muffled or like there's an earplug, still have this feeling but a little, music quality is worse and not enjoyable in my right ear, it sounds less clear and I have discomfort after few minutes.

I’ll check it with another AirPods tommorow, maybe it’s just my right one playing it worse, but seems like it ear problem. And they still get tired more easily ESPECIALLY the right one, I still don’t use it for AirPods.

I’ll go to the doctor in a few days, but want to know your opinion if my description tell you smth.

I don’t know what to do. Advice?

Explain to the doctor what you are comfortable with and what you are not comfortable with. They will explain what kind of tests/exams they can offer and you can agree together what you are willing to try. There may be a really crucial test that is difficult for you and you can weigh up whether you can manage it or not. Or maybe start with some very simple tests (like a hearing test- just headphones and beeps) and work up to something more tricky at a later date.

Remember some of your fear might be based on your experiences as a small child, now that you are older and can understand and make decisions more, it may be less scary/painful/awkward than it was before. As a small child you would not have understood the benefits of having someone poke in your ears etc, now you will.

I hate needles and being cannulated (who doesn't!) so I never really fancy having that done but I understand the benefit to my health of having a blood test etc.

The alternative is to do nothing and continue to cope with your issues untreated. You do have a choice.",2025-05-29 06:42:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ky3zcx/ear_exam_hearing_exam/

1kxkf0p,HearingLoss,How did you know it was SSHL?,"2 months ago (3/28) my hearing faded slightly in my left ear and started to ring. It came out of nowhere while I was driving, i figured it was some kind of eardrum spasm. I could still hear, but researching I saw the mention of SSHL which brought me a lot of anxiety. I ended up going to the ER because it was on the weekend, and the doctor said it’s probably tinnitus and sent me home with no steroids. I mentioned SSHL, he didn’t know what that was. 

Since then my hearing in that ear has been fine, I don’t notice any hearing loss. 

Today (5/28 an hour ago) this happens
 in my right ear now. Same thing, seemed slightly faded, but can still hear. Just a ringing thats a little louder than my normal tinnitus.

Phone calls and conversations still sound normal from what I can tell I don’t hear any missing frequencies. Im out of call outs at work and would hate another trip to the ER, but is this symptoms of SSHL? 

Im wondering if it’s something else, like if my acid reflux is triggering this, since it’s been bad today?

You cannot know. That's why you start prednisolone immediately, regardless of the etiology, even if it might be something else. Until you see an ENT and get your audiogram done.

1kxbdda,HearingLoss,SSHL or Otitis Media with effusion,"I have been suffering from one sided hearing loss, ear pressure/fullness, tinnitus and lightheadedness since start of the month, went to a couple of ENTs and have had different diagnosis, hoping someone out there can share their opinion on what this might be.

My ears in the past would get blocked from either impacted wax, flying on a plane, or a cold/flu would cause liquid to get trapped behind my ear, and  I would have some tinnitus whenever my ears got blocked. I was last recommended to put a tube to drain the fluid, but I never got them, my hearing eventually got better in a few weeks, but that was more than 5 years ago.

Mid March 2025 - I had hearing loss for a couple of weeks due to impacted ear wax, I had it removed and my hearing returned to normal.

Early April 2025 - I travelled on airplane and suffered the usual pressure pain, hearing normally returned after a few hours, nothing unusual.

End April 2025 - Started feeling like my ear wax was returning, tried to self clean what I could, then after a couple of days there was discharge of brown/red color from my ears, thats when my hearing loss started, at that time I thought it was just infected or impacted wax, so decided to wait.

8 May 2025 - Felt my head spin while sitting on the chair (just for a second or two), so I decided to lie down on the bed for a few mins, tried to get up, felt my head spin 2nd time, lost my balance and fell back to my bed. For the next 30 mins to an hour my head did not spin again but I felt this sensation of lightheadedness, like being on the sea, like the  ground was oscillating a centimeter up and down every few seconds. My tinnitus was getting worse too. So I decided to go to ENT, did an audiogram, diagnosed with SSHL, given 60mg prednisolone, mecobalamine, betahistine. Doctor said my hearing loss has nothing to do with outer ear or wax. I had my doubts so decided to get second opinion.

11 May 2025 - Visited another ENT (someone with 40 year experience), got an audiogram and the result came out I had conductive hearing loss (mild to moderate), then got tympanogram and it was flat, indicating fluid behind the ear and diagnosed with Otitis media with effusion, thats when I decided to not go back to the first ENT, my new ENT advised to continue my prednisolone that I was prescribed for 1 week and stopped. My new ENT gave me allergy Aerius 5mg tabs for a week and nasal spray.

18 May 2025 - There was slight improvement in my hearing, no vertigo episodes, just lightheadedness, visited ENT and got allergy tabs for another week and a follow appointment for tympanogram on 25th May.

22 May 2025 - Woke up and heard a pop sound and my hearing loss and tinnitus worsened, with lightheadedness on and off.

25 May 2025 - Visited ENT, my tympanogram was flat again, doctor performed tympanocentesis, made a hole and drained the fluid, I got immediate relief from fullness/pressure, hearing improved moderately but still had tinnitus. Asked to continue nasal spray and stop allergy tabs.

28 May 2025 - My hearing and tinnitus slowly worsened and today it is the worst it has ever been. I have an appointment on 8th June but planning to go earlier as the doctor said there is 20% chance that the fluid in middle ear appears again. My tinnitus has been driving me crazy and now I am concerned if this is related to SSHL or something permanent.

8 June 2025 - Visited ENT and hearing test came back with mild hearing loss and tympanogram still a flat type B. Prescribed Prednisolone 30mg for one week and also told to perform valsalva maneuver 10 times a day.

15 June 2025 - Prednisolone helped a lot, hearing, tinnitus and dizziness improved a lot, visited ENT and hearing test came back within normal limits with small Air-Bone gap at 500-4000 Hz. Tympanogram now changed to Type As. Prednisolone reduced to 20mg for one more week. Continuing to perform valsalva maneuver but my ears would only pop once in the morning.

21 June 2025 - Stopped prednisolone and the next 2 days had severe headache, body pain, dizziness/tinnitus worsened. Hearing felt normal though.

29 June 2025 - Visited ENT and hearing tests results back to normal but with mild hearing loss at high frequency. Dizziness/tinnitus reduced but still on/off at times. Prescribed Betahistine (Serc 24 mg) for 6 months. Told to continue performing valsalva maneuver for 2 months. Given an appointment for after 6 months.

20 July 2025 - Just when I thought things were finally getting back to normal, I sensed fluid returned in my middle ear with mild to moderate hearing loss and pressure sensation. I could feel extra bubbles popping when performing valsalva. I decided not to go to ENT and wait it out and try something at home, so every night for the next week applied warm compress over my ear/cheek along where I thought my Eustachian tubes might be in the hopes of melting/draining the fluid before it becomes a glue.

30 July 2025 - Starting to see improvements, fluid behind in middle ear has definitely decreased, tinnitus has decreased, hearing has improved but still not normal, still feel dizzy at times so hoping things get better soon. Been a month on Betahistine (Serc 24 mg) and planning to continue another 5 months.",2025-05-28 07:52:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kxbdda/sshl_or_otitis_media_with_effusion/
1kxag8r,HearingLoss,Husband is dealing with nearly 100% deafness..,"Hello, I'm posting this story hoping for advice or even just a conversation with anyone dealing with something similar, or maybe his story can provide insight for others. My husband has a long medical history but I will try to keep a long story as short as possible, which is still long (lol sorry, I really tried to condense it). In 2006 at 38 years old he was diagnosed with an Acoustic Neuroma (now called a Vestibular Schwannoma)in his right ear which rendered him 100% deaf in that ear almost overnight. Hearing aids won't help since the tumor destroyed the 8th cranial nerve. 

This news obviously came as a shock to him as he initially thought it was just impacted earwax when he went into the Dr. for the hearing loss. Over time he has learned to cope with it and has done fine for the most part, although he has issues hearing in noisy settings and knowing where sound is coming from, along with balance issues and occasional brain spasms.

 In 2022, he experienced vertigo, muffled hearing and tinnitus in his ""good ear"" on the left side. He took Prednisone for a couple weeks and it seemed to clear up the problem after about a week of taking the medication. 

 However since then, there have been occasions where he has experienced the muffled hearing/ear fullness/distorted voices and has gone off and on Prednisone on multiple occasions. The ENT's thought he had eustachian tube dysfunction along with Meniere's Disease and were treating it as such by putting him on hydrochlorothiazide medication, which is supposed to help with treating Meniere's Disease.

 Recently in 2025 now, when he had his latest ""flare up"" in his good ear with the muffled and distorted hearing, we were told by an Otologist and a Neurosurgeon that he actually has nerve related hearing loss and they don't think it was Meniere's Disease after all, as it would be incredibly rare to have 2 different diagnoses for the ears. They believe he has one condition effecting both ears, even suggesting that he may not have a Vestibular Schwannoma at all but that in fact it could be an inflammation mass this entire time. A possible misdiagnosis since 2006! We also learned he is not a candidate for a cochlear implant in the right tumor ear.

(As a side note: he's received 6 MRIs in the last year and 2 CT scans. Also lots of audiologist visits and ENT visits)

 He's now on Prednisone for 3 months and while his hearing is currently better while on the medication, he's having side effects and can't be on it for forever. After the 3 months he's supposed see a rheumatologist and start taking immunosuppressants, but they're not sure even this will all work out for him. They are wondering if he has an autoimmune disease but the blood work hasn't come back with anything definite so far. He has follow up appts, and an appt for Bi-Cros hearing aids.

To conclude, we're really starting to get scared and concerned as he sometimes wakes up nearly 100% deaf due to these issues, and as soon as he goes off the Prednisone we know his hearing will be lost again, yet he can't be on prednisone for forever. He's still working but is having a difficult time due to the random hearing loss and anxiety/depression from everything. We're tired and stressed. Has anyone else dealt with anything similar? Did anything help? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this story.

I’m not sure if anyone in this sub has dealt with exactly the same thing, but there are a lot of people in the sub that have dealt with sudden and ongoing hearing loss. Some are just mild, some are severe, and some total loss. As for myself, I woke up one morning missing the lower frequencies in my left ear. Prednisone did nothing so as of now they are gone for good. I have had a hearing loss in my right ear (high frequencies) since I was a kid. Luckily they balance out and I can hear pretty well without HAs. 

I can however understand the anxiety and depression your husband is going through. I have dealt with anxiety and on/off depression since my loss. It’s always anxiety of further loss. I wake up in the middle of the night and notice my tinnitus being different and it freaks me out. Any change in anything freaks me out and spikes my anxiety. I would totally suggest he see a therapist to help him deal with the mental aspect. It has helped me tremendously. 

He is lucky to have a supportive partner to help him in this. People who don’t have tinnitus or hearing loss can’t really understand what we go through. I have a supportive partner as well who had deal with me going through panic attacks when it first started. 

As for doctors, I’m truly convinced that even though ENTs and audiologists and neurologists SAY they know what is going on, I believe the inner ears and hearing are still something they guess at. We just have to deal with what we can and hope for the best.

I am no help but just wanted to say I’m so sorry he is going through this.. I’m going through mild ETD atm and I did start out with ear wax on my drum. I was so stressed, so scared so I can’t imagine how he must feel with just waking up and feeling deaf. That is absolutely so terrible and I hope something helps him!",2025-05-28 06:50:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kxag8r/husband_is_dealing_with_nearly_100_deafness/
1kx8ewv,HearingLoss,Noticed this community was a bit small. Here are some advice from someone who has suffered from Tinnitus since I was 17 years old. 22 Now,"Hey guys and gals, 

  If you are reading this you probably are going through what I am going through to some degree. I lost my hearing through loud sounds and medication. It has been a rough slap of reality for me. Here is some tips because my tinnitus has gotten BETTER in a way. It's definitely louder but I don't want to harm myself anymore over it.

  
Somethings that helped me. YOU DONT have to follow. I just want to HELP &lt;333

1. Ashwagandha -Helps me keep the stress down which minimizes the ringing. This can be just be changed to something natural that keeps your cortisol levels down. Trust me. Stress hits it like a truck.

2. Learning to live in quietish environments - I noticed when i keep the DB levels between 30-40 throughout the day it makes my tinnitus calm down. It may sound counter intuitive but it really has helped me cope and adapt.

3. Exercising- Getting the blood flow running and getting dopamine in a healthy manor goes far. 

4;. Relaxing ASMR- Having background sounds that are soothing or even positive confirmations have helped me.

5. I avoided Tinnitus maskers- At first I went head first into these things. Though, I realized that when I was not listening to the maskers it was making it wayyyy more noticeable when I was doing my normal day to day stuff.

6. Probably the biggest one Hobbies- Find a hobby that can distract your thinking to something else. I play video games and I rarely notice my ringing. My ringing is pretty bad too. 24/7 but when I am zoned in on something my brain kinda ignores it. Not saying I don't hear it at all at times. Most of the time I don't realize I have it.

Other things I have not tried yet

1. CBT- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is apparently really helpful from what I have seen from doctors.

  
Side Note

LOVE YOURSELF!! YOU ARE A STRONG PERSON AND YOU DESERVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS LIFE! DON'T GIVE UP!!! There is hope!

1kwstjs,HearingLoss,How can I help my grandma? Better hearing aid suggestions?,"My grandma (91F) has struggled with hearing loss for years. It’s gotten significantly worse the past few years and she has been using hearing aids from I believe Hearing of America.

1kvq9ab,HearingLoss,"FYI for those with current hearing loss, your phones accessibility settings can really be helpful.","I had a time where I had sshl in my right ear and it took a long time to recover. During that time I had to have a tube put in my left ear, which was my good ear. I was literally that guy who was ""deaf in one ear and can't hear out of the other"". I decided to try the hearing impaired settings on my android phone. 

It would listen to everything in my environment and put text on the screen to tell me about it. It would also yell it really loud for me. It told me that it could hear water running and I should check. I was washing my hands. On TV, someone knocked on a door and the phone flashed and told me someone might be at the door. There were many other times that it let me know something was happening. 

I didn't explore it too much beyond that, but those things were nice to get me through for a while. 

I haven't seen it mentioned in this sub so incase you never thought about it, maybe give it a try and see if it helps. :)

1kvnkvk,HearingLoss,Is this common? Temporary hearing loss,"I work in a restaurant and spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Sometimes there’s a sudden loud noise and the hearing on whichever side of me was closer will go out temporarily. Not entirely, it just feels like someone gave me one ear plug out of nowhere. Sometimes there’s tinnitus too. Every time this happens, my hearing gradually returns within 20 minutes. Because it always returns so quickly, I have never been concerned before but I’m surprised how easily my hearing cuts out when I’ve never heard anyone else in the kitchen mention this and even the coworkers I’ve asked have denied experiencing this.

Is this odd or unusual? Does anyone else experience this?

[댓글]
Start wearing ear plugs at work. If your ears are noticeably affected by the noise volume, your hearing could deteriorate with time.

Years ago, I had a similar situation. I was a drummer and routinely would get ""that rock concert effect"" with ears ringing for a few hours after each gig. Since it went away each time, I didn't change up anything. 

I really wish I had. 

Not wearing hearing protection in that environment significantly contributed to the hearing loss I have today.

Figure out how to change your situation, whether it means wearing hearing protection at your current job or switching jobs/environments altogether, as radical as that sounds. Years ago, had someone told me I need to stop playing drums to avoid the hearing issues I have today, I would have done it.

Don't take this advice lightly. This is your hearing we're talking about, and years from now you could seriously regret not changing your current situation.

This happened to me last saturday, exactly the same. Did it occur again?",2025-05-26 06:32:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kvnkvk/is_this_common_temporary_hearing_loss/
1kv9j6p,HearingLoss,Why Stem Cell Therapy is Currently Focused on Congenital Hearing Loss — and What It Means for the Rest of Us,"A recent systematic review (SCIRP, May 2025) analyzed 65 studies on using stem cell therapy to treat congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Results from animal models showed promising regeneration of cochlear hair cells and partial hearing restoration. But most clinical trials in humans are still early-stage or show limited improvements.

This raises a big question:
Why are most of these efforts focused on congenital hearing loss — and not age-related, noise-induced, or viral SNHL?

Here’s why:

1. The cause is known and targeted. In congenital SNHL, specific genetic mutations or absent cell types (like hair cells or spiral ganglion neurons) are easier to correct or replace.


2. Cochlear structure is often intact. Unlike acquired hearing loss, which frequently involves inflammation, scarring, or damage to multiple cell types, congenital cases may simply lack certain key elements from birth.


3. Fewer confounding factors. This makes it easier to design trials and measure outcomes in younger patients without comorbidities.



But here's the hopeful part: The same regenerative technologies (like iPSCs, MSCs, and gene editing) could potentially be applied to acquired SNHL in the future. Researchers just need to overcome bigger obstacles, including:

Damage to neural connections (synaptopathy)

Inflammatory or vascular components

Integration of new cells into a more hostile or degenerative environment


Bottom line: Focusing on congenital cases is a strategic first step. If stem cell therapies prove safe and effective there, they may soon be adapted for broader types of hearing loss.

1kv90c1,HearingLoss,Just felt like sharing this,"When I was 17 I just randomly woke up with a tinnitus in my left ear and since that day my hearing hasnt been quite the same. This happened out of the blue and even after a lot of medical exams I never discovered the reason. Now I'm 20 and it's never been a big problem in my daily life. Overall I can still hear most things just fine, but sometimes (specially in loud places or when people whisper or have a low volume of voice) I just feel a bit left out. Also, it's a pain asking people to repeat themselves, I feel like it's annoying for them. I know for sure that as years go by my hearing will continue to deteriorate (slowly but surely). So yeah its just a minor thing not a huge problem but sometimes it slightly gets in the way of making conversation. This doesn't usually affect me but sometimes I cant help but wonder how much I'll be able to hear when Im 40 or 50 or 60. Welp. Just a little moment of sadness, Im still lucky cause its a really minor thing.

Thanks for the share. Let's hope by the time you hit 40- 60, there are affordable and non-invasive devices that can help hearing. On the other note, there are some people who don't have the intention to listen to others at all (me, me, me type). For those, there won't be much help in decades, though. Hope you have a good day.

Is not a big thing? It is a big thing darling. I'm also in the same situation. Suddenly I lost part of my hearing in the right ear. It feels exactly as when my mother passed out. Same sadness. Is hard for me. Also I'm a music lover and now this please is just gone. I have the same chalanges as you, I nod when people say something, I can't hear them in loud places, hard to focus. It changed my life for worse. To be fair I still hope in a miracle. They say if steroids don't work since the first days, the chances are low, but I can give you my example that gained in a year a medium of 15dB gain in the low frequencies in the left ear, again after a sudden hearing loss. It recovered by itself no steroids were used because doctors I went to were no good. With the right ear the story is worse. I don't see much recovery. It dropped few times in a row, this time I'm afraid is for good. You should try hearing aids. I checked how does they feel like and I can tell you is making you a much nicer reality. Sure is not the same as your hearing and may sound digitalized, but is making you more easy to focus in you daily tasks.",2025-05-25 18:08:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kv90c1/just_felt_like_sharing_this/

Without knowing exactly how loud the sound is, it’s hard to give you a definitive answer. If the sound is over 85 dB and is constant for 8 hours or more then you’re at risk. 

I’d say it’s unlikely construction noise is over 85 dB if you’re at a distance and with walls protecting you.

1ktszsh,HearingLoss,Hearing loss after ear infection,"Been trying to find a story online like mine but yet to find one. Likely because people who went through what I went through probably recovered but just thought I’d gauge the floor.

On May 8th I woke up after being sick with a sore throat and body aches for a few days prior. I went to work like normal but about half way through the day I felt my ear plug up. Thought it was just because of the sickness. As the rest of the day went on it started hurting more and more and more. I went to the urgent care that night where you looked in my ear and said “yup ear infection” sent me home with antibiotics. The next day I wake up with blood colored discharge in my ear and the pain is gone but I can’t hear right and the ringing was god awful. 3 days later something in my ear still just didn’t feel right. I couldn’t hear, I was getting a weird double echo and bad tinnitus. I went to another ER where he looked in my ear and said could be “labyrinthitis”. Sent me home with another antibiotic and 20mg of prednisone and a referral for ENT. I got into the ENT 3 days later where she looked in my ear and said there was inflammation but no sign of infection anymore or fluid behind my ear. My ear still felt full and the ringing was driving me insane and I couldn’t hear well. While I was there we did an audiogram and I had sleight hearing loss just under 20 dcb in my lower rangers and at around 2khz-8khz I was down to around 35 dcb on my left ear.  She started me on high dose prednisone immediately and said the hearing loss isn’t that bad and I have a better chance to recover. I have anxiety so this has just been a living Hell for me panicking, freaking out about the uncertainty, the ringing in my ear never stopping and the high dose steroids made me feel terrible and I had bad physiological effects from it. I have been none stop in the internet looking up shit (which is terrible don’t recommend nothing but negativity in these forums because again, the people that recover likely move on) 

2 days ago I go in for my follow up, fullness in my ear is way down, I have 100% speech recognition (it was 75%) and I’m back above 20 dcb except for I’m at 25 dcb at 4khz and 6khz. Paper says “Little to no loss/boarderline SNHL now.

I am now tapering off the meds but I have anxiety so I have this immense panic over losing my hearing again while I come off the meds. I keep thinking I’m feeling pains in my ear or I freak if I feel any movement when I swollow. 

Today I feel amazing, I can hear as if I never had it, the fullness feeling in my ear is very little now and the tinnitus is the quietest it’s been yet but I still can’t get over the panic of losing my hearing once I finish this taper. I have looked online for someone who had a similar situation but mostly all I see is negative people pointing out the worst thing that happen to them or a pissing contest about who had the worst situation.

I’m sure I’ll be fine coming off the meds because the hearing loss was likely due to inflammation my ear due to the infection. I even did a hearing test today to with the Mimi app and it’s showing my hearing on the left at 91% and the hearing on my right at 99%. 

Should I be freaking out coming off these meds about losing my hearing again? I only want to hear from people that lost hearing due to an ear infection. I understand a lot of people lost there hearing with no known cause or they found out about an autoimmune thing later but can I hear from the people that lost it and recovered from INFECTION!

I'm so sorry you had to go through this. But at the same time, you're doing great because your hearing is completely restored. You don't have to worry about stopping your medication. Do as your doctor tells you. If your hearing is back, then all parts of your inner ear are healthy. That's great news for you. And that's a pipe dream for 99% of people on this subreddit. 

So please, appreciate it! And keep your nervous system healthy.

Yes, it happened to me, but due to ischemia, not acoustic trauma. It sounds like robotic, although in my case it improved a little and I heard echoes again. Even so, it is not the same as before. I recommend that you go to the ENT doctor and look for anti-inflammatory drugs with steroids. If you want good news, I recently found a similar case that was cured after about 5 months.

I had acoustic trauma on one side from auto airbag deployment. Distortion sounds like a blown speaker, kind of a buzz or rattle or kazoo effect. I had quick treatment with steroids (oral and injected) but unfortunately no improvement. Hope your experience is better.

Started the oral steroids within hours and did 3 injections at 2, 4 and 6 weeks. It wasn’t offered to me but HBOT is talked about as a treatment.

You are right there are not many posts about distortion. For me it is worse than the threshold loss. Hearing aid addresses the threshold loss but just makes the distortion louder. Fortunately I just have it on one side

1kqa3oq,HearingLoss,Hearing after myringoplasty/eardrum graft surgery,"It has been almost 4 weeks since I had myringoplasty surgery on my right ear to patch the perforation in my eardrum.

For context I sneezed a couple years back, blew my ear out and was never right since. Hearing was super muffled and mild tinnitus caused me day to day issues with hearing people.

Anyways, when I first came out of surgery, my hearing was super loud and clear it was fantastic. I could hear the rumbling of the car, ambient noise, and everything was super crisp. Surgery went fine and all was good.

However a few days later it went really muffled again like it was pre-surgery. Ive also had more noticable tinnitus as well. Its been almost 4 weeks and not seen any improvement really. I keep the ear dry and been sensible so nothing of note has happened since surgery took place.

Im just concerned that I started so strong and now its gone downhill massively.

Any one else had a similar experience?

Maybe im jumping the gun and its too early to tell. 

So frustrating as it really impacts my ability to hear people properly.

UPDATE: Well the surgery was a success in the sense that the eardrum has healed fully and no more hole. My hearing is slightly better but still not good enough so Ive been referred for hearing aids lol. Win some and lose some I suppose!

Interesting..I had mine a couple of weeks ago and I've been pretty deaf in that ear. I put that down to the packing material.


If you've had the opposite it might mean the graft has failed. I would get on contact with ENT dept.

I also did myringoplasty 3 weeks ago. I am also having tinnitus continuously about one week. I worry and have anxiety. Have you seen your ENT? 
Any improvement?

I am on 5 weeks post op now. I felt a bit needle like pain inside my ear. My hearing is still ok although not the same hearing like my left ear, but better than pre-surgery. 
Did you feel like that during your post op? 
Ringing in ear is continuously.

Check out this dB widget, tells you exactly how long you can be exposed to certain volumes:

https://soundbites.com/pages/how-soundbites-helps

In your case, 95dB should be good to up to 1,5h

Hearing loss occurs over a prolonged period of time (most studies have examined occupational exposures over a working lifetime). A single 6-hr exposure is unlikely to cause permanent hearing loss but if this is what you do on a regular basis, then you're putting yourself at excess risk.

The World Health Organization's [Make Listening Safe](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/deafness-and-hearing-loss-safe-listening) recommends listening at 80 (A-weighted) decibels for no more than 40 hours a week. For every 3-dB increase in sound level, you need to cut duration in half, so at 83 decibels, you cut that weekly exposure to 20 hours, at 86 decibels you can only be exposed to 10 hours per week, and so on, you can see that at 95 decibels, you exceeded your entire weekly limit in those in just over one hour. It's not just how loud, but how long. Always keep that in mind.

Yes it can and possibly will.",2025-05-18 17:40:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kppo06/95db/

Could you please share your audiogram?

Yea when you lay down on you ears do you hear a swooshing sound and are you right now able to hear like dishes being cleaned and thrown around in the sink?

Sounds like you might have hidden hearing loss that is affected in the extended high frequencies above 8K.

How are you doing now? Any treatments?

I’m having the same issue. Trauma occurred at an urgent care when I went to get my ears cleaned. The ENT says there’s nothing they can do for it but it may go away in its own. It’s been almost two months now. Wondering if I can sue

Does it pulsate? Mine was helped by hearing aids but isn’t pulsatile.

Sadly there isn’t a cure for tinnitus. We all suffer from it but the good news is that it gets better over time. The first few months are the worst but your brain dies start to get used to it (even though it’s your brain making the sounds).  You just need to figure out things to mask it. Waves. Cicadas. Fans. Something.

Following, as I'm just starting the Tinnitus in a noticeable way.

I have tinnitus, my hearing loss is moderately severe and I would describe my tinnitus the same way. I'm also old enough to have lived with it and have experience with many bouts where it gets more intense.

My advice is that sometimes you need to focus on the sound and accept it. I describe it as ""going into the sound."" Whatever it is, really relax into feeling it. You don't have to enjoy it, exactly, but try to open yourself up to it as much as possible.

It actually can make it easier to deal with. Like try meditation/breathing exercises while you focus on the sound.

I also advise earplugs if you're someplace safe, like trying to sleep. I find that it helps if my brain knows for sure the sound is not external. If you use earplugs make sure you are safe, I have fire alarms that light up and wear an Apple Watch to bed, plus I have a husband and a dog to warn me if something happens in the middle of the night.

White noise machine or you can use an Alexa/Google etc and ask it to play white noise

I recommend you the app named Relief made by ReSound. ReSound are world leaders in manufacturing hearing aids. They have ""the best"" tinnitus management system. This app is made by them, is free, and you can combine different sounds to make a more pleasent experience listening in the headphone than hearing that tinnitus. I know how it is. Same problems in here. I also have hearing loss. Is terrible.

Also try to discute with your doctor about Betahistine. In here is pretty much the main treatment. I'm still on Betahistine and Pentoxyfiline. They are both good for improving blood circulation in the inner ear. However the results are mixed. If you ask me, it did helped, I think my tinnitus may be permanent without that. I still have rare moments of lack of tinittus. wow.. what a luxury. Ask the doctor about it.",2025-05-18 03:30:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kpaone/tinnitus_help_me_make_it_stop/
1kp9s8c,HearingLoss,Should we get Cochlear for my 2yo?,"My son has had unilateral hearing loss since birth with no known source. His hearing hasn’t changed in 2 years. I’ve been told he’s a good candidate for CI and I’ve done a lot of research on it.

On one hand I want to provide him with the best opportunity to hear every beautiful sound the world has to offer. Because even with his hearing aids he still doesn’t have full range of hearing in that ear. I’ve been told that when he begins school this can cause issues for him keeping up with his peers because of localization and other factors.

On the other hand I feel extremely nervous about putting him through this life changing procedure before he’s old enough to even understand it. I initially wanted to wait so he could make the decision but was told that the effectiveness of the implant can wane a bit over time.

I’m nervous about what happens when he gets older and wants to play a contact sport like football or something and he can’t because he might dislodge the CI.

This is a big decision and I want to do the best thing for him but it’s so unclear what that is. Any advice or experiences from yall would be greatly appreciated!

1kniwxp,HearingLoss,What is the maximum safe decibel level after acoustic trauma?,"I had an acoustic trauma almost 5 months ago which resulted in mild hearing loss. 

Music sounded so terrible, practically mono-sounding, that I basically stopped listening to it. I was a classical musician when I was younger and my mind is musical, so it was a big loss. 

Probably over the last month, I've been listening to music more because I've gotten better acclimated to this new diminished/disappointing sound. I've been better able to distinguish nuances in music that I lost after the accident.

I was having a good hearing day yesterday and was listening to music in the car at around what used to be my normal volume. It didn't hurt or feel overwhelming, so I just went with it. By the time I got home last night, I realized that my hearing was off and reduced/diminished and my ears were a little plugged. I woke up today, and they were the same.

I went out to the car and measured the volume I was listening to with decibel x app (idk how accurate it is) and apparently the volume was around 85 decibels, fluctuating from 83 to 87. 

My understanding was that 85 db should be okay but something at or above 90 is going to cause irritation. I'm therefore confused as to why it caused an immediate problem. I was singing along to the music as well (heaven forbid one have a small moment of spontaneous joy), so idk how that affects total volume. 

If anyone has advice or an opinion as to how loud an acoustically traumatized mind should be listening to music in a car, I would appreciate it. 



[댓글]
If you have hearing issues and you like music a lot then i recommend you to buy a sound level meter to stop doing extra damage, because smartphone apps aren't very accurate due to microphones limitations and dynamic behavior.
But for your question, for a person with acoustic trauma it's better to avoid sounds above 80 decibels at long term like music listening.

I'm definitely going to get one of those; thanks for that rec. 

Based on my experience yesterday, I agree with 80db.

There's no such thing. 

Once you're subjected to acoustic trauma, all dynamics in your cochlea changes to an unknowable state. 


Reduce sound exposure as much as you can, that's the best advice anyone can give you.",2025-05-15 20:46:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kniwxp/what_is_the_maximum_safe_decibel_level_after/

1kmwzza,HearingLoss,"Dont have sudden hearing loss, thought I did but my hearing has not come back fully","About a month ago, I hit a bong without water stupidly and then my right ear felt a tiny bit muffled with dizziness. I passed my hearing tests the day after because I was nervous that it was something serious. The ENT said it was eustation tube dysfunction, and said it should be back to normal within a couple weeks. Those weeks have passed and I still have difficulty hearing in crowded places and noises seem reduced. They said I didn’t need steriods at the time but could those be an option now?

[댓글]
Steroids could mean a couple things. If there was a suspected sudden sensorineural hearing loss then the ENT would have prescribed prednisone. This doesn’t sound like a sudden sensorineural hearing loss, so prednisone is not required. 

If you’re experiencing Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) then a steroid nasal spray is sometimes prescribed. Often ETD goes away by itself, it’s a condition that’s not usually a big deal. It can sometimes take some time to go away.

If your symptoms have worsened, I would get the hearing checked again. If they have lingered, but not worsened, then maybe give it a month. If still not better by 1 month you could go back to your doctor for a follow up.

Ent has no idea so makes something up. I would be a great ent. I can shrug and order MRIs as good as anyone. If your hearing test is fine don’t fuck with steroids. They are a last resort for serious hearing loss. Smoking messed you up a little, that’s what it does it can cause tinnitus and hearing loss and make it worse. Stop smoking pot if you care about your hearing. Steroids can as do fuck up your hearing. It’s a Hail Mary for serious loss.

It was very bad and my ear felt clogged and I wasn’t even really able to make out voices clearly. I saw the ENT immediately and they started me on steroids 3 days after symptoms started. I was on 60mg of prednisone for a week before tapering down. I got 3 prednisone shots to the ear drum too. I just tapered off steroids 3 days ago. I have made a lot of progress but around 4000htz my hearing has only recovered to 45db.  Has anyone had experience with continued improvement 2 or 3 weeks after treatment started and you finished your steroid course?  I am thankful for the hearing I got back but the doc is skeptical I get anything back beyond this.  I have read of people continuing to improve a month later but wondering if anyone has experiences like this.

My last and best improvement happened almost two months later. I had an idiopathic profound SSHL in my left ear on 03/07/25 at 10:30 AM. I started hearing a low ringing that gradually increased until it became quite loud. I also felt my ear was clogged. I saw an ENT three hours later and began treatment shortly after with 60 mg of prednisone. I received one dexamethasone shot six days later, as the oral prednisone hadn't helped.

I experienced the first small improvement after 18 days, but my hearing was still at a profound level. After about two months, it improved from profound to severe. I hope to see more improvement in the third month, although I know the chances decrease as time passes.

I also had improvement up to 3 months later. I started to see a slight improvement after 7 days and then it improved little by little over several weeks. Everything is very gradual and slow.

1kmk2sc,HearingLoss,Looking for support,"My 5 year old was just diagnosed with Moderate Sensorineural Hearing Loss (low frequency). They want to get her hearing aids and are setting us up for more testing because they believe her hearing will continue to decrease as time goes on. They threw a lot of information at me at once (they were very kind, I was just in shock) and I’m still kind of reeling. I never noticed any issues with her hearing until she failed her 5 year hearing test. She speaks well with a small speech impediment, has a fantastic vocabulary, has never struggled in school, and has never seemed to miss anything anyone is saying. 
So finding out all of this has been really shocking. 
I guess I’m just looking for some support and some reassurance that she is going to be alright. 

Thank you so much ❤️

Is it one ear or both?  If one ear then I’m not surprised you didn’t notice. I have low frequency sshl in one ear and most of the time I have no issues hearing. I wouldn’t worry so much about continued hearing loss because my assumption is they are guessing. Hearing is one of those things that I feel most experts are taking an educated guess with. 

With her being so young, I feel she will more easily adapt to it because she doesn’t know better. It’s harder when you get older because you really know what you lost. There is a chance she was even born with it. Myself, I was born with a hearing loss on the right side…high frequencies. I never noticed unless I took a hearing test. When I experienced SSNHL on the left side as an adult, yes I noticed for sure!  Sudden hearing loss with a sudden onset of tinnitus!  

She will be fine and live a normal life. Don’t stress so much about it, especially in front of her because it will stress her. Just make sure you protect the rest of her hearing. 

Good luck!  You got this!!

1kmbvm2,HearingLoss,"The long and painful way to get sound tailored to Hard of Hearing (and maybe low level deaf) so we can enjoy nuanced audio like everyone else. Sadly, it's PC specific.","Hopefully this is acceptable here, because even hard of hearing people can love good sound. I'm a low budget audiophile, JBL fanboy (go ahead roast me, bang for buck is spot on for me.) Lazy copy-pasted this from a post I put on another sub a couple days ago, so edits are in time with the journey I went on to get this figured out. This is more about bringing HoH community some noise in the quiet than about the dollar value or equipment. (Quiet... that's a cute thought, to all you vintage audiophiles, be half deaf, that tape hiss sound of my stupid godawful tinnitus is a 24/7 throwback to blank cassettes at high volume.)

Ok, for starters, I'm moderate loss left ear, moderate severe in my right. To all your normies, that's ehhhhh 60 percent hearing loss in left, 70 in right. The frequencies and db levels are different per ear, and listening to pc audio on the headphones or speakers is (to me) always 'off' because of that no matter how loud.

I LOVE music, and absolutely adore a good quality sound, so I often at home go without hearing aids in favor of wider more rich sound from my JBL can style headphones, or the atmos sound system connected to the pc. I admit to leaning heavily on trying to compensate with pure volume, but the sound is imbalanced, because the EQ ranges aren't actually set to ME, just everything up more. So something is way too loud in order to boost the specific points on the audiogram that I need.  
It's always bothered me, like enormously that I can't hear it like it's supposed to because, well, most onboard EQ software (JBL quantum engine, lookin at you) are kinda crap and adjustments don't feel right. I spent good money on these sound devices, and I want them to make sense for ME with minimal work.

Here's how I did it, it's a little unfriendly to get going, but once it's up, I mean... jeez, dead center, every sound range right where I need it for my particular hearing. My reference was Avi Kaplan's Peace Inside because he's got such a range, his music is simple but hits all the hz for me to tell the difference, unique way that his tone has an airy... scratch to it that I can't catch usually.

THIS IS ALL WINDOWS, I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH MAC

1.) Ask ChatGPT to look at and interpret your audiogram (and it did shockingly well).

2.) Once that's done, ask it to make an EQ file for EQUALIZER APO - [https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/)

3.) Drop that txt file of your hearing ranges into the config folder of Equalizer APO and let it do its thing. Restart your computer.

~~4.) Now you need PeaceEqualizer interface.~~ [~~https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/~~](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/)

~~4.2) This part sucks. In PeaceEqualizer: On the full toolbox, (muck around till you find it, all the way to the right and in the middle) IMPORT that config file.~~

~~4.3) Restart, make sure that it's loaded and turned on.~~

5.) Right click the speaker in your system tray, go to sound settings, select your device, then at the bottom, check to see what spatial sound or other settings are off for now, AND TURN YOUR SOUND WAY DOWN for now, cause you're about to tax your speakers.

6.) Listen to whatever is on your list of songs or movies that give you those big sound field shivers.

6.5) At this point, you're really done, if you're overwhelmed with the process, just stop here, cause next stuff is deep audio nerd territory.

7.) Dicker with maybe adding spatial sound inside the windows sound panel, or using other post processing to fine tune it. I tried it with Dolby Atmos for Headphones turned on and it just... went nutso, so there's money wasted. My suspicion is with the gain and db increases, it might have maxed either my headphones or the Atmos software.

Go to music land with a stupid smile on your face, because it's... just... well it's basically my hearing aids but with that big wide sound field that you almost taste. Hearing aids are great, but they're not really designed with big bass and trill, wide sound in mind. They're to help us hear the world, not the band.

I'm not absolutely sure of this (software engineers, please explain?) but I believe that the Equalizer or PeaceEQ is going in under the radar and changing the sound before windows even gets its hands on it, which to me is a risk I'm willing to take as far as making stupid happen from a software standpoint.

I haven't messed around with individual controls on either panel much yet, but this success needs to be shared. I also haven't yet tried it on the tower pc speakers, honestly cause I'm nervous my neighbors will reach the end of their patience with me.

Lemme know how it works out for you!

Edit: To those of you that did this, what was your go to test song or audio experience?

EDIT2: I've dropped peace eq from the equation. The program is very nice and once you get used to the clunky interface, it's very good at what it does, for other applications than this. The problem that I found is that it doesn't always play nice with the layers of other audio processing software (windows native stuff, Dolby Atmos for headphones, 7.1 equalization. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DOES NOT SEPARATE LEFT AND RIGHT CHANNELS. Which... my mistake for not realizing.

Also adding: ChatGPT is an awesome tool but it really needs you to look over it's shoulder. I realized after much mucking around, it was readding my audiogram a little funky, so I went back and forced each tone and db in one by one. This gave me an exact file of DB gain per ear, per frequency. Which IMMEDIATELY MAXED everything out and for that, was totally useless. We (me and chatgpt) had to work together to reduce overall gain, then adjust each channel relative to that to make it so that speakers aren't immediately blown or distorted. End result is crisper, without having to crank the volume into the sky or turn it down so far that it's useless. Obviously success is relative, cause, for me, what does 'normal' sound like?

I’m sorry you’re struggling right now. I’m struggling with the same situation currently but in both ears. (32F). Just know you’re not alone and take it one day at a time. You’re right, things could be much worse, but still work through your emotions because they’re valid. For me, it feels as though Im mourning a piece of myself that is gone and can’t get back. From what I’m gathering from this community is that it can be a real struggle at first, but you learn how to cope/manage/deal and you continue to live your life. If anything, it makes you appreciate life just that much more. Hang in there.

Do you have your audiogram over there? Would be really helpful to have it

I totally feel wanting to just get your normal hearing back. I lost my hearing in my left ear almost a year ago and I dream about waking up and having normal hearing again.… To hear people’s voices like I used to without the struggle. Just know you’re not alone in wanting that.

Getting an MRI is important. You need to get onto prednisolone so you can at least recover some of it.

Vitamin D, Omega, cutting out alcohol, caffeine, sugars and carbohydrates has helped some people.

Losing your hearing as an adult is tough. You will go through a grieving process (look into 12 steps) but one day you will accept it. Don't let this define you. Know that we are given challenges in this life but we can overcome them. Hang in there. It's easier said than done but it's not impossible. Your life will change, but maybe for the better.

I've only recently been diagnosed after being in denial. I have decided to get hearing aids which I'm getting fitted for in a few weeks. I know there will be some adjustment. For me, it's been a bit of a roller coaster going through a bunch of emotions, mostly nervous and excited. It's like any loss, you have to go through a grieving period. Make sure you protect your ears in loud environments to preserve your hearing. For me the part I'm having a hard time with is how to deal with and tell friends, as I'm usually the one there for them and have a hard time opening up about myself. You will get through this. There will be an adjustment, but you've got this.

Off topic, but we are seeing more and more hearing loss in young persons, largely due to high exposure to high SPLs on headphones.

Im in a very similar boat I 18(M) have mild to moderate progressive hearing loss. Right now I can hear most everything but it's not the same there is an air of ""wrong"" around sound. I used to love music so much it was my life. Now it doesn't satisfy me like it used to. My favorite way to listen to music rn is getting a small speaker cranking the bass up in a song I like and listening to it with the speaker against my chest. Something about feeling the music creates that feeling you get when you are  listening to a song you like, even if you cannot fully understand it like you used to.

It takes time to learn how to be deaf or hard of hearing. There is nothing wrong with you, change is scary, it's gonna be okay. You will find peace. You will learn new coping mechanisms. You will find peace in your way of existing even though it's different to how it used to be. 

If you ever need someone to talk to I'm available I was diagnosed earlier this year in January/February ish it's been a shock it's been hard. 

Hang in there

Hey 18M here! I was diagnosed with hearing loss when i was 10. And as of now, i have high frequency loss in my left ear while my right one has moderate. As I was 10, I was ashamed to wear hearing aids as i thought ppl will start looking at me differently and even bully me lol. So for 2 years i didnt wear my aids and therefore the loss in my left ear got even worse and thats when i started wearing it. Now anyone will think this will change their life forever, so did I. But here is the thing I learned the hard way— people will speak, its their job to speak.. I remember when i went to school the first day wearing those, my friends asked me tons of questions, I was afraid they will stop being friends w me but they didnt. My thought of my life changing forever was gone. Most of the people treated me as normal unlike few loafers.. anyway now that im applying for colleges, there is a benefit that i have special reservation because of hearing loss lol. Ppl will judge u in the beginning but eventually they will stop. You are normal, just need a device to hear clearly, there is nothing wrong with that. Chin up, dont be afraid

I suddenly lost my hearing in my right ear a few years ago. I have lost all high frequencies. They call it sudden hearing loss. If I had been given prednisolone instantly i would’ve recovered some hearing. But by the time someone saw me who realised it wasn’t an ear infection etc it was too late. 
My hearing in my right ear is like being underwater. It’s muffled. I get sound but no detail. I have a hearing aid in that ear now, but it doesn’t help the actual hearing! It seems to just amplify what I can’t hear properly!! But it does help with the tinnitus that came with it. 
Definitely have your MRI. I did. It rules out anything sinister. 
You do get used it somewhat. 
You have to put people on your “good side” and have the subtitles on the tv if they’re all mumbling! I struggle mostly in loud environments like restaurants and pubs. But like you say, there’s plenty worse.

Hearing is just as important as vision. Get assessed for a hearing aid now while you are still young. It won’t restore hearing 100% but even correcting a mild loss can make a huge difference. 

I say this as a 40 something whose hearing was a slow gradual loss from childhood. I needed hearing aids and never got them. Should have had them in high school.

1klzvum,HearingLoss,27M Left ear sudden drop off,"So let me preface this acknowledging that I have not taken care of my hearing at all. I will say I have taken it for granted and am a bit worried. 

Bit of backstory I’m 27, I have been playing in bands and going to shows for the last 12-15 years and also work in construction. I had hardly had any tinnitus issues in the past with it being typically once or twice a month where it would feel as if my left ear closed and it rang for ~10-45 seconds. This past weekend I played a show everything was fine I did not go down to eye level with my amps or take any amplifier feedback to the face. after the gig I had no issues whatsoever and starting around yesterday evening my left ear has substantially dropped in hearing volume. There is a very low hum in my ear,  when I would randomly have tinnitus it would be a very high pitch whereas this is very low. 

I tried cleaning out the left ear today since I woke up this morning and it was still present. It’s kind of freaking me out. In the past I’ve tried using earplugs at practice but it just made playing not feel right so for the past ~7 or so years I have neglected any hearing protection when I would be playing. 

What are the recommended next steps?

I highly recommend it, it's the best app for hearing tests, all you need is a well known pair of headphones (most of them are on the calibration list of the app) without any eq or mods and go to a quiet place, the app has a built-in noise meter so you will know if the ambient will interfere.
Before my audiogram (took by a doctor) I tried this app by myself and the results were really really close to the audiogram by the doctor, so that's actually good. I used Anker Q30s headphones. It's a really good way to check if your hearing is getting worse through months, i had a Temporary Threshold Shift and the app detected it well, with a +35dB dip at 4khz that at the next day was at normal thresholds.",2025-05-13 19:32:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1klv3a3/a_musthave_app_for_all_concerned_with_ssnhl_and/

Because of this, I immediately visited an ENT specialist and underwent a hearing test. The results are as follows, and the doctor examined my ear with a camera and said there’s nothing wrong. However, I’m still curious about the incident that happened this morning.

1klmxbb,HearingLoss,I suffered sudden hearing loss in my left ear a little over 2 years ago. Since then it’s steadily gotten worse every year.,"Has anyone experienced anything like that? My ENT that I’ve been seeing doesn’t have a good explanation as to why it would be getting over time. I had an MRI immediately after the initial loss occurred to rule out tumors and then a second MRI with contrast to make sure the first didn’t miss anything. Both showed no abnormal growths or any physical reason for the loss. Initially he thought it might be Ménière's disease but I’ve never experienced any of the other common symptoms associated with it other than tinnitus. 

I have a new audiogram scheduled for next week but I can already tell that my hearing has gotten worse and my hearing aid less effective. I’m worried that I’ll eventually end up losing all hearing in that ear (which may be inevitable) if I don’t find some way of mitigating it. 

I’d love any advice or to hear similar experiences. 

[댓글]
If it makes you feel any better, I suddenly lost all hearing in my left ear. Not just a little.  Poof gone. I’m still waiting for my MRIs that are scheduled soon &amp; obviously a bit nervous about that, but no signs of Menieres either.  (although my mom has that)  

They basically said sometimes it just happens, but I’m hoping for the best &amp; that I can regain some hearing with treatments.

I lost hearing in my right ear (around 60dB) in Aug 2024, and the ENT said it's SNHL and another ENT said it's otosclerosis - idk.   
Also, I've T in that ear. They didn't tell me any reason why I lost the hearing, and I freaked out for a longggg time. Now I think I've made my peace with it BUT the thought of losing more hearing scares the shit out of me. And the thought of anything happening to my good ear is my BIGGEST fear. They scheduled my next audiogram, which I missed intentionally because I'm scared of the results.

Did you get a full body MRI or PET CT scan? I started with hearing loss then they found igg4 related issues throughout my body. Since then, I've joined FB groups, with people that suffer from long covid and most of them say that the issues started with the left ear.

I was told by my ENT that once the loss hits it won’t get worse. And it won’t move to the other ear. I got my loss about a month after having my Covid booster in September 2024.

You might be having another SSNHL episode. See a doctor urgently.

1kksgx9,HearingLoss,"Feeling Alone – My 8-Year-Old Has Sensorineural Hearing Loss, and I’m Struggling to Get Support (South Africa)","Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. I’ve been quietly navigating this journey for a few years, but lately, I’ve felt really alone and overwhelmed.

My son was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss at age 5. He’s now 8. We live in South Africa, and it feels like support is incredibly limited. Every conversation with professionals ends with, “the teacher must wear a device,” and “he needs a hearing aid”—but he doesn’t have one yet. And getting to that point feels like climbing a mountain with no map.

He’s in a mainstream school and manages okay on the surface, but I can see he’s starting to slip. He communicates well, and I think that makes it harder for people to understand how much effort he’s putting in just to keep up. The school often dismisses my concerns—even with specialist audiologist reports. I feel invisible, and so does he. I’m terrified he’s going to get lost in the system.

I guess I’m reaching out to ask: has anyone else experienced this? How did you advocate for your child when others couldn’t see what you were seeing? What helped you get the support your child needed—especially in a country where these resources feel scarce?

I’d be so grateful for any advice, encouragement, or just to hear from someone who understands

1kknrn2,HearingLoss,Are battery operated HAs still available?,"(severe-to-profound loss)I have a 10 year old set of Starkeys that I got originally for a job. Now I work in an environment where I am required to wear earplugs, so hearing aids are rarely worn. 

I was looking into getting a new set, and I'm finding a lot of rechargeable options with 10-12 hour usage range. I worked 14+ hours at the job I was *legally required* to wear hearing aids, and a set of batteries would last a week or two. 

I had a Phonak FM transmitter with a proprietary rechargeable battery to use in college that was an absolute joke. The battery wore out in a short amount of time to the point of only being useable for less than 6 hours (in a 10 hour class day), instead of the reasonable option of AA batteries that would have been used in the past.

I'd like to be able to get a new set of aids without needing to ration *when* I get to use them. Batteries were relatively cheap and could be replaced quickly at a moment's notice. 

Otherwise, it's like the hearing aid manufacturersnare willfully and maliciously promoting the discrimination against hearing impaired individuals.

[댓글]
Yep! Just about every brand has a battery option. My current HA which I bought about two years ago is a battery version. I didn’t want to have to deal with a slowly degrading rechargeable battery.

I have the same problem as you.  The rechargeables aren't good enough for the number of hours I work.

My audiologist is so excited to get me the Phonak Infinio Sphere.  I don't know the model, but Phonak previously introduced a model as rechargeable, and then a version with batteries a month later.

And by the way, the estimated life of the recharge is based on not using some settings, like Speech in Loud Noise, which cuts the life of the charge down to something like seven hours.  Well, of course I use the programs my hearing aids come with.

I'm sorry I don't remember details, but some of the audiologists on YouTube talked about this recently, and there are still some hearing aids being made with disposable batteries.  It's late here, and I can't find the source videos I looked at, but I will try again later.

My current Phonak, only about five years old, uses disposable batteries.  The ones I use, P13, are sold at almost every drug store, I never have trouble finding them, though I usually buy several months worth when I see my audiologist - the same audiologist who tells me everything is rechargeable now, sells disposable batteries.  Huh.

Very. I can’t tell you how many times my batteries have died when I’m out and all I have to do is reach into my pocket and replace them.

Yup! I have BTE battery operated phonak aids :)

The first trial pair I tried (about a month ago) had batteries-Phonak Paradise that lasted about a week. The ones I have now (Phonak Infinio Sphere) (and will keep) are rechargeable but after ~12 hours of wear I still have 60+% battery left. No idea how long they will actually last. I do work from home so the sphere portion doesn’t get daily use- battery might not last as long if it did.

Since I wear my aides for about 15-16 hours a day, my audiologist wouldn't even look at rechargeable. He said it just wouldn't work with my lifestyle/needs. Currently have Phonak Nadia with batteries. Batteries last at least a week. Most models have both options.",2025-05-12 08:55:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kknrn2/are_battery_operated_has_still_available/
1kkchbj,HearingLoss,How loud is an MRI?,"I have moderate hearing loss and tinnitus. I stay away from loud noises as much as I can as it makes the  tinnitus worse for days later, and always carry earplugs.  I was wondering if any of you have taken an MRI and if the noise it generates is a concern?

[댓글]
Call and ask. They always had ear muffs for me.

It's very loud. They should supply ear plugs and an ear muff. I had acoustic trauma when I did one, and the implementation of both prevented further irritation.

Very loud, but my local hospital puts in soft earplugs and then puts headphones on too. They can play music on request, and I do request, but I barely hear it even at the highest volume as I can still kind of hear the machine.

Extremely loud. I wouldn’t recommend it if you can avoid it. I’m not allowed to get MRIs due to a hearing condition I have called noxacusis that makes loud sounds extremely painful and permanently damaging to my ears (more than normal ears.)

Very loud. I listen to music. I get MRIs all the time bc I have MS. I got a bonus mri of my ear when I had sudden sensorineural heating loss.

They give you ear plugs and then they put these soft things over your ears you'll be

It's quite high, but don't worry, it's nothing absurd. I had an MRI as soon as I lost my hearing in one of my ears, my ear was very sensitive and had a lot of tinnitus and everything went fine. No problem.

I got one yesterday. I had headphones that played music. It’s important to note I am already noise sensitive by my sensory issues. It was very overwhelming. My tinnitus didn’t get any worse. Ear wise it was okay. Sensory wise it was not a fun time.",2025-05-11 21:55:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kkchbj/how_loud_is_an_mri/
1kk2tar,HearingLoss,Just got my first pair of Hearing Aids for mild to moderate hearing loss. Still having issues hearing people talking.,"Edit: after a couple weeks, I started noticing improvements in my overall quality of life.  The first few days were nerve racking, but now im having more confidence talking to people.

Got the Widex brand and noticed immediately sounds that I was missing.  After a couple days at work I am still having trouble understanding all the same people who prompted me to get aids in the first place.  

Its like the volume of everything went up except for voices.  Driving in my car listening to podcasts, im hearing the sounds the car is making, things rattling and clacking, but find my self turning up the volume to the same levels I was without hearing aids. 

I expressed this concern to the audiologist who basically said that this is as good as it gets.  These were expensive for my budget and we have about 30 days before our 100% refund period expires.

Also some sound seem excruciatingly loud like the sound of washing hands.  Can you get additional damage to hearing if they are set too high?

Thank you for reading

[댓글]
Make an appointment with your audiologist to do real ear measurement inside the 30 days. They won’t have set the sound levels damagingly high, but it’s normal to worry about this because you haven’t heard these sound levels in maybe years. Wear your hearing aids every day. You need to retrain your brain to deal with normal sound levels. This will happen. Voices may get easier in the same time frame. (Your audiologist has tools to tweak this over time, with some limits.)

Similar experience here as well. Prior to hearing aids, I had a difficult time understanding people in the presence of background noises. Once I started to wear hearing aids, there was a flood of sounds which my brain eventually eliminated. However, I still can’t hear a conversation in a medium loud restaurant - I’ll hear a spoon dropped in the kitchen though. And it doesn’t matter if I switch between the pre-programmed modes (e.g., restaurant with noise cancelling or speech focus or hear everyone) or manual adjustment. I asked a friend who had hearing aids for longer and he also confirmed that it is still challenging to hear speech in a restaurant - it’s as good as it gets apparently. Maybe my tinnitus is interfering. Good luck!

(severe-to-profound loss) Some of it very well may be your ears relearning sounds and speech recognition, but in my experience the aids will *always* pick up background noises at a distracting level. I've even had to take them out when it's windy outside, since the wind will blow right into the microphone.

Idk about your hearing aids, but I have the same problem. The audiologist I saw said that when we get hearing aids our brain has to relearn some sounds we couldn't hear before. Also it's kind of an assault on the senses when you can suddenly hear so many things new. I've been wearing mine for approx 6 months and it's calmed down. I don't hear the background noise as loudly. I hope that had something to do with your question.

My first hearing aids were very jarring in terms of what I heard - sudden sounds like shopping trollies being bashed were amplified a huge amount. My audiologist wasn't available in the 30 day time period (this was specsavers in the uk), so I returned them. Possibly an adjustment would have helped. I got different hearing aids from a different company and with a much more responsive audiologist.

I guess my recommendation is that if it doesn't sound good, don't assume you just need to get used to them. They might just be setup badly.

Everyone is voicing the same issue. The reason we all have trouble with voice clarity is due to the frequency range of the human voice. We can hear a pin drop, but can’t easily understand what is being said. This is the harsh reality of hearing loss. The most expensive hearing aids won’t help

Get the audiologist to add settings. My Widex has Universal, Classroom, Music, Comfort (mute), and MT (for places with a heating coil).  It really helps to switch. It also takes some getting used to. I wear my hair up a lot now because I can’t stand the sound of my hair against the hearing aid. When I complain about it, my audiologist and others with HA act like I’m crazy and should just live with the loud “scratch scratch” sound. So, go ask for more settings, but also, sadly, HA only helps to a point.

i just want to say, i use hearing aids and experience all of the same. it often feels like i can hear everything BUT voices. i think hearing aids amplify everything in the same way, so if there are competing environmental sounds that are the same volume as the person talking to you, its incredibly hard. 

to a degree, it is as good as it gets. hearing aids do not necessarily help with clarity, just volume. that being said, there should still be programming an AuD should be able to help with!

If you’re interested in this or any other study at Clinilabs, feel free to DM me!

Did they just do the initial programming when you got them? Or did you go back to get further adjustments prior to this discouraging assessment? That first programming often needs follow-up visits to fine tune everything once you've used the aids in real world situations. 

If they're saying its association good as it gets without doing any further adjustments, I'd seek out a second opinion. 

I agree with having them do a Real Ear Measurement if one was not done. This measurement means not only are the aids adjusted to your audiogram results but you individual ear anatomy as well.

What made you choose the Widex specifically? It's harder the first time because you can only guess what will best suit your needs. It's hard to know your needs when you've never had them met before. I didn't make a bad choice with my first pair, after that I had a better understanding of how, when, and where I most needed them.

I also have a busy workplace where there's a TON of constant background noise. Work and medical appointments are the only places I ALWAYS have them in. I don't wear them at home much (my partner has no issue accommodating my loss, and it's just us in the house.) I wear them when out running errands, but can typically do ok without them. I need mine to work optimally in those 2 places, but otherwise I can generally get by ok, especially when I'm with people who are willing to be a 'back up' pair of ears.",2025-05-11 14:51:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kk2tar/just_got_my_first_pair_of_hearing_aids_for_mild/
1kk1ik1,HearingLoss,Unconventional methods to get hearing back,"Has anyone successfully recovered some  hearing using unconventional methods?

I asked chatgpt and this is what it gave me...

 Here are some unconventional or lesser-known methods that may help with hearing recovery or improvement, especially in cases not involving permanent damage:

1. Sound Therapy – Using specific frequencies and tones to retrain the auditory system, especially useful in cases of tinnitus or auditory processing issues.


2. Bone Conduction Devices – These transmit sound through the bones of the skull directly to the inner ear and can help in conductive hearing loss cases.


3. Acupuncture – Some people report improvements in hearing or tinnitus relief after consistent acupuncture sessions, though results vary.


4. Vitamin &amp; Mineral Supplements – Nutrients like magnesium, zinc, B12, and folate may support ear health, especially in noise-induced or age-related hearing loss.


5. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) – Occasionally used for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, this therapy increases oxygen to inner ear structures.


6. Neuroplasticity Training – Brain-training apps or auditory exercises designed to enhance how the brain interprets sound.


7. Craniosacral Therapy – A gentle, hands-on therapy aiming to release tension in the central nervous system, which some believe may benefit auditory function.


8. Eliminating Inflammatory Triggers – Gluten, dairy, or high-histamine foods can contribute to inner ear inflammation in sensitive individuals.


9. Manual Therapies for Jaw/Neck Alignment – TMJ issues or cervical misalignment can sometimes contribute to hearing issues. Chiropractic or physical therapy might help.


10. Silent Retreats or Digital Detox – Reducing auditory overload and stress may sharpen hearing perception in subtle cases.

Honestly, I’m getting ready to go to South Korea to have stem cell therapy/PRP done to hopefully bring back some of my hearing. The doctor in South Korea has trained a few doctors here in the USA with using his method and there has been a lot of good feedback from the patients who have underwent it. It seems to be a very good promising procedure though everyone’s experience varies. I’ve done about 4-6 years of research and am now finally looking to make the trip there.

I can only comment on a couple of them. 32M with moderately severe hearing loss (neurosensorial). 

I've done acupuncture and I have found it effective on a wide range of physical and mental issues, but it hasn't done anything for my hearing.
Silent retreats: I do 10 days silent meditation retreats once a year. Great for my mental and spiritual health, no improvement on hearing (and my tinnitus goes through the roof after 3-4 days usually).
Bone conductor headphones: pretty good for phone and videos calls, but I really don't like the sound quality for music. And it hasn't change anything hearing wise.

Dr here, none of these will bring any hearing back after the damage is permanent. That's why early intervention and saving the cochlear cells as aggressively as possible in ssnhl is important before losing them for good.",2025-05-11 13:52:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kk1ik1/unconventional_methods_to_get_hearing_back/
1kjrzzw,HearingLoss,Coping,"Hello, 

I just got diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss that is pretty significant for my age (32). I’m just really struggling with knowing my hearing is as bad as it is. I have constant tinnitus, and muffled ears that feel blocked. I know I’m struggling with Eustachian tube dysfunction to some degree as well. My dr wants to put me on prednisone for 17 days, has anyone ever had luck with this clearing up any nerve related hearing loss? Research suggests it only helps if it was sudden and treated within the first 72 hours. Also really really nervous about the side effects. 

Bottom line, I’m really struggling to cope with my hearing loss diagnosis. I feel as if I’m mourning a part of myself that I no longer have. I keep being told by my drs that I’m too young and this isn’t “normal” for my age. I’m not sure how it happened, possibly a virus? Maybe listening to music too loud my entire life? 

Thank you if you’ve gotten to this point. Any advice is so appreciated.

I can't speak for the steroids as never offered that but I also experienced unexplained hearing loss in my mid 30s and really identify about coming to terms with it. I felt very sad and ""why me"" for several months, not to mention frustrated with the hearing  difficulties, tinnitus etc. I've been wearing a hearing aid for about 9 months now and I have to say it's been really helpful and has actually helped me come to terms with it. Pop it on, don't struggle to hear as much anymore thus less frustrating and less obvious that I can't hear, therefore I think about it less. My brain isnt so tired from trying to keep up so my hyperacusis has lessened and I don't feel so worn out. I fixate on it all less and just crack on. I suppose no different from wearing glasses really, it just has ""old people vibes"". Hardly anyone notices my aid but I'm also fairly upfront about it
 In short, it gets better!

I have the same type of hearing loss and issues with muffled sounds, tinnitus, Eustachian tubes. I was born with enough hearing loss to need hearing aids, but ended up losing a lot more from the corona virus. There isn’t a lot of research on this, but if you lost hearing after Covid, there’s a possibility it could be related. I’m 18 and also have way too much hearing loss for my age. Prednisone didn’t help me, but I didn’t notice many side effects. Have you looked into Eustachian tube balloon dilation? I had this procedure done, and it helped SO MUCH. I ended up getting an ear infection later that year and my ears ended up back how they were before the procedure, but I would do this procedure again in a heartbeat. It was easy and painless, and it gave me a few really good months of peace. I wasn’t very careful with my ears after this procedure, but if I was, it definitely would have lasted longer. It could be worth talking to your doctor about. The only other this I’ve noticed is that when I maintain a healthy sleep schedule, my tinnitus isn’t as bad throughout the day. As far as coping goes, acceptance and self love goes really far. Hearing loss can feel really devastating, but it gets better after you get used to it and find some things that help. Advocating for yourself at work and in social events also helps a lot with the communication disadvantages that come with hearing loss.

Research doesn't suggest it only helps in the first 72 hours, it's best if it's given in the first 72 but not only that. 

What do you think will happen of 17 days of prednisolone use? 

How long has it been since your symptoms started?

Steroids are you only hope, why on earth are you wasting time questioning!? Get them now and start injections today aswell! Move, quick.

I’m 36 &amp; was also just diagnosed with SSHL. It’s been very heavy.

Edit: My docs also couldn’t pinpoint anything they saw as a leading factor to why it happened to me.  I’ve never had any hearing issues prior, so this has hit me like a ton of bricks.

&gt;I keep being told by my drs that I’m too young and this this isn’t “normal” for my age

While the National Institutes of Health (and other sources) suggests [SSHL is more common between late 40s and early 50s](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/sudden-deafness), if you search this sub, you may notice the overwhelming majority of people posting their age are younger.

Hi! I had SSHL happen in February and took 14 days of steroids with no other intervention. I’m 31. I’ve recovered about 70% of my hearing with some more intense loss at random frequencies. I have a history of heart palpitations and the prednisone slightly increased those but the only other side effect I had was weight gain from water weight and eating too much sodium (could not stop snacking on Cheez Its LOL). The fullness went away about 3-4 days into taking the medication, and that was honestly a HUGE relief. That part was the worst for me personally.

I would highly suggest doing the steroid, and if not oral, then look into the injections. But basically doctors have no clue how or why this happens to most people, and the only line of defense is the steroid. It works for some and not for others. I started getting my hearing back around 3 weeks after symptom onset (so 1 week after the end of my 2 weeks of steroids). 

As far as mentally adapting—your brain is amazing and will help you compensate for the hearing loss. Give your body a little grace that it’s adjusting to a brand new scenario. 

And FWIW the doctors called mine idiopathic, meaning unknown cause, but I’m 90% sure it was from taking Wellbutrin—which was causing circulation issues for me a couple days before the onset of my SSHL. So if there’s anything you noticed about your circulation, could be related to that. 

Chin up! I’d counsel you to follow the doctors advice.

I had a sudden hearing loss in November last year. I lost all my hearing in my left ear. Just like you, I'm very young, I'm only 28 years old and I hate taking medicine, I like natural things. My doctor at the time prescribed me Prednisone and at first I took it without even thinking about it because I was VERY unwell. After about 3 days of taking it I started to have a lot of insomnia because of the medicine. So after 5 days without any improvement in my hearing, I stopped taking it. But today I regret it. Then I learned that just taking the entire dose in the morning would help prevent insomnia. Today I think I should have tried harder. I also hate medicine, but think about it being an emergency and in cases of emergencies they are the only way out. It's not forever, it's temporary. I hope you recover soon and if you want to talk about it, just call me. Today it's been 6 months since I lost my hearing so maybe I can help you with something.

I’m so sorry you’re going through this and can understand the concern for taking any type of medication. I took a high dose of prednisone when I experienced SSNHL nearly 8 years ago and the side effects were awful (insomnia, dizziness, nausea) but I don’t regret it one bit. I was able to regain a slight bit of hearing and even though it’s not enough to increase my word count recognition meaningfully, knowing that I had exhausted all my options to try and reverse my hearing loss set me at ease and helped me begin to move forward with my new reality. I also know quite a few people whose hearing regained after prednisone. Good luck and hope it’s going well for you so far!

I am not at this unfortunate crossroad, but i do however have constant tinnitus, and i will say this flonase has helped with clearing the tubes, but I'd look into getting an mri scan done if it's feasible for you, also have bloodwork done if you haven't already.  Ask your primary care doc to schedule both, have them check your vitamin levels aswell, and make sure to ask that it stay within network, don't need additional cost from an out of network specialist.  Yes the mri is loud and requires ear protection, but knowing what's going on in your noggin may provide clues as to what's happening with your hearing. Also this may be a slight bummer but hearing aid technology has come a long long way. One of my previous Commanding officer had severe hearing loss at 29 due to being rocked by a huge ied that his truck hit. He had bone-conduction hearing aids that helped him ALOT.",2025-05-11 03:49:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kjrzzw/coping/
1kjnod0,HearingLoss,Dealing with insecurity about my volume. How do you cope?,"At 33 I’m realizing my hearing is rapidly deteriorating to the point I need hearing aids. What’s equally as devastating is that I guess I speak extremely loud even when I’m whispering. I was always constantly told when I was younger that I was very soft spoken, constantly made fun of for it and made to feel like I was less than for it, and I was so insecure about it that I made it a point to over project my voice. I was also extremely shy which I worked very hard overcome. I’m now - or idk going forward - but until today was not shy anymore and very outgoing. I work in nursing now and I felt I had to project my voice even louder so patients can hear me and I thought my volume now was just because I got used to speaking louder.

I had my hearing tested last year and was told my hearing is normal and that I don’t have hearing loss,l which makes zero sense, but now in nursing school my classmates make comments often that they can hear me even on another floor and that even when I whisper I’m really loud. I’m feeling extremely insecure about it now.

In my adult life I’ve loved that I’m outgoing and outspoken and charismatic but now I’m embarassed because I guess that just means I’m too loud and the logical explanation is that my hearing is deteriorating so fast I can’t hear that I’m speaking louder and louder.

Im scared to get my hearing tested again and finding out how bad it is and then learning that I have to wear hearing aids now. Also patients with hearing loss don’t really speak loud that I can tell which tells me even more that I’m losing my hearing.

How do you guys cope with this if it’s an issue you have? How do you navigate life interacting with people? What do you tell yourself to overcome the insecurity or train your voice to be soft spoken even when you can’t tell?

Part of why I love nursing is because I love socializing and interacting with people but now it’s become one of my many biggest insecurities in life. Just another reason to want to isolate to save myself from embarrassment. It makes me want to hide and not socialize with anyone.

It seems like you’re speaking loud because you cannot hear yourself. If that’s the reason, maybe try talking in a different voice tone? See if there is a way of speaking where you can hear yourself well. I was born with hearing loss and have always had hearing aids, but what works for me is talking deeper than normal. I can hear myself much better when I talk in a deeper tone, and I’ve done it for so long that it’s just my normal voice now. If there are people that you are close or comfortable with at work, you could also ask them to help your correct your volume by kindly letting you know you are loud and working together to bring you back to a typical volume. If you know what a normal voice range feels and sounds like from your perspective, it will get easier to find it and keep yourself in it. Just remember, even though it’s nice to fit in, it’s also okay to be too loud or too quiet.",2025-05-10 23:46:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kjnod0/dealing_with_insecurity_about_my_volume_how_do/
1kjh6j3,HearingLoss,I was just reprimanded for not wearing hearing aids,"It's 10:00 am on Saturday. I'm doing kitchen things. I try not to put my HAs on too early, or I lose too much time during peak listening hours. I get 12 hours out of my battery unless I am streaming something and that kills the battery. I stream a lot. 

When my adult son spoke to me and I had to ask what he said, ""why are you not wearing your HAs at 10:00?"" So I can hear later in the day just got me a look of incredulity. 

I am quite deaf from SNHL in both ears. My left ear is profoundly deaf, the right is a little better. On Tuesday, I am having cochlear implant surgery on the deaf ear. I will be learning how to understand sounds after activation. I do have the idea that while I am healing from surgery, I will be deafer than usual. It's going to be interesting, that's for sure.

1kje1c3,HearingLoss,How can I protect against snoring?,"I've noticed for a few years now that my hearing is becoming duller. I've had tinnitus for a long time and now my ears seem to hurt at even the slightest volume in my headphones. I have my earwax removed every 3 months because it would block my ears completely, but now when I get it removed it doesn't restore my hearing to how it used to be.

I've recently become paranoid about loud music in the car and in my headphones. I would listen at pretty loud volumes. But I've just realised that a major cause might be my snoring. I've been snoring extremely loudly for at least 6 years, likely a few years longer. I have sleep apnea with mostly hypopneas where I am straining to get enough air. The snoring occurs pretty much all night at high levels. So this must be doing a number on my ears :(

I'm in the process of treating it but it's difficult and I will need surgery. I've used a CPAP and it didn't eliminate snoring but I think it reduced it. Unfortunately it doesn't really work so I don't want to use it. 

What should I do? I have Sony noise-cancelling headphones and I read they're a better option than earplugs, but when I wear them just with the noise-cancelling they seem to make my tinnitus worse. But I've read they definitively don't cause hearing damage.

1kixu54,HearingLoss,Hearing loss from shooting,"Hi everyone! So I went shooting with friends 2 days ago and since then have had hearing loss and muffled/fullness feeling in my ear. It was indoor range and I was wearing ear plugs, yet I have small ears and think it possibly dislodged itself a little idk. But regardless my right ear is good and my left ear is crap from the loud noises

 I knew my ear was muffled but when I put an AirPod on to test I could barely hear anything, I started freaking out rlly bad. The following morning I went to the doctor where they told me I also had an ear infection and it was very inflamed in my ear. They prescribed antibiotics along with prednisone and ear drops as well. 

My hearing has retuned slightly, like now when I put an AirPod in I can hear the music, but it’s still muffled and high pitches sound funky. It feel like I have cotton shoved into my ear and want this to go away so badly. Im now having noticeable tinnitus , it’s nothing too bothering but it’s definitely there.

 If anyone has similar experiences please share them and if it got better or not. I will never take hearing for granted again and protect my ear in any way I can going foward, I just hope it at least returns or the muffledness feeling will go away.

Edit:
It has been about a week and a half and I now feel like my hearing has returned to 95% normal. Sometime when I’m in a closed space like taking a shower, I can tell my hearing is off a little but besides that everything seems relatively normal. I got a hearing test done yesterday and the results indicated noise induced hearing loss, however it’s improved its way back up to the normal range at least. It’s bc I went to the doctors immediately and got the needed medication.  have been extra careful taking care of my ear from loud noises. Comparing my ear to last week i am beyond grateful things are returning to normal.

1kij8qo,HearingLoss,SSHL - Crackling/Clicking Noise - Anyone?,"In Feb '25 I had SSHL in my L ear. I was born deaf in R (slight high tones but no word association) so losing nearly 85% of my hearing overnight has been devastating to me. To add to my misery I have MS and an acoustic schwanoma on the R. of brain (I wish I were kidding, sadly). My hearing loss has been in the upper frequency, I cannot hear mid to high tones in L, only bass. I now hear the actual ""picking"" notes of a bass guitar while listening to music, and cannot hear the melody any longer.

Completed standard treatment of steroids oral and tympanic injection x 3 with very minor improvement and as I'm not a candidate for a cochlear implant, I'm now waiting on a hearing aid.

To get to my question - Since this started, I've had the most bizarre ""crackling/clicking noise"" in the back of my head/left ear when I turn my neck to the left or swallow. It's driving me nuts. I already have tinnitus in my R from the schwanoma the ""screeeeeeee"" sound and this is just adding another level of insanity to the mix. This did not start until the SSHL happened.

Any ideas as to why the SSHL would cause this weird cracking /click that I'm now getting?

Adding my hearing test it will fit:

1kii79i,HearingLoss,6 months of hearing loss due to labyrinthitis,"Hi everyone, writing here to find out if anyone else had a similar experience to mine and how your recovery was. On November 10, 2024, I started to lose the hearing in my left ear. I would lose my hearing for a few seconds, followed by dizziness, and then it would return to normal. I stayed like that for 5 days. Until November 15th, I had a VERY violent attack of dizziness, my hearing went away and never came back. I was carried to the hospital vomiting a lot and with a horrible feeling in my head. I thought I was having a stroke. I stayed in the hospital for a few hours, vomiting a lot, very sensitive to light, sounds, I couldn't move my head because I was so dizzy. And my hearing in my left ear was completely lost. After I went home I was very weak for 2 days. I couldn't even take a shower alone. I took 40mg of corticosteroids for 1 week. Little by little I recovered. My balance returned to normal throughout the week but my hearing did nothing. My ear still felt very blocked, as if there was water inside it. When my hearing didn't come back, I started HBOT. I did 25 sessions, it wasn't easy at all. But over the course of 2 months my hearing loss, which was profound at 85dc, went to 58dc. Which I consider a victory. Well, today it's been almost 6 months. My hearing hasn't improved any more than that. I can say that I do almost everything normally, work, drive, do light physical activities. But I still feel really bad, I've always been very active, I exercised a lot. I miss who I was. I have really good days where I don't even remember this happening to me, but I also often have VERY bad days. Some days my affected ear feels more inflamed. The tinnitus is louder, the sensation of being covered up is greater, I have dizziness, sensitivity to light and I can't be very active. A few times a week I also have the same feeling of my ears plugging and unplugging that I had right before I lost my hearing. This scares me a lot because I don't know what is causing it and I'm afraid of having another crisis like that. I also have a lot of exhaustion and brain fog. I feel like at any moment I'm likely to have another attack like the one that took my hearing. I've been to so many doctors and none of them seem to understand this. I feel anxious and depressed despite the great improvement I've had in that time. Sometimes I think I will never be the same again. Has anyone else gone through this? How was your recovery?

Not sure if this is what you're looking for but:

Any bathroom doors in public places would have a visual indicator when in use.

(I always knock but rarely hear if someone replies. And I have then walked in on far too many people who do not lock the door to go to the washroom!)

Closed captions that are reliably accurate, including with less common vocabulary, and that show more than a few lines at a time.  

Some are close, like OpenAI, and the feature on Zoom that shows the entire transcript of the meeting in closed captions if you select that option (it is in the same area as the chat box).

i dont think its a device, but ending language deprivation

Glasses similar to Ray Ban Meta glasses that function as high performing hearing aids, prescription glasses, and functional AI technology

Hearing aids that are actually helpful (i.e. they don't pick up and amplify every piece of background noise).

Better technology. More funding to find a cure.

Non expensive hearing aids ,waterproof hearing aids, room intercom connected to every room of my house..even the garden,  products to wash my impacted earwax better,  any device, hearing aids or products that improve tinnitus significantly,  more tiny hearing aids (just inside the canal) even if I had a severe or profound loss. Pills that could fix the affected bones of my ears,  pills that renew cochlear health. Hearing aids that could amplify the volume of voices more than background noise without the background sounds being absent.

Wristbands that vibrate and can show a few words immediately, from a radius of at least two miles.

I work with exotic dangerous animals and it's always a concern that I won't be able to hear and then proves information on the radio. I usually can tell something is happening quickly and get myself to safety, but it would be really nice for my manager to be able to send me just a couple words, like a name or location without me having to have my phone. The specifics are what give me trouble. One animal escaping may be a 5/10 ""go inside and shut the door"" danger, while another is a 10/10 ""go inside, shut the door, go in the backroom, shut that door, block it, and hide in the shower"" danger.

Auracast, is going to be one of them, if it works as predicted.

1khydxl,HearingLoss,Reverse slope sensorineural hearing loss,"Hi again friends, I made a post 2 weeks ago about a sudden diagnosis of nerve damage in both ears after being referred to seeing an audiologist to test my hearing, I woke up one day 4-5 months ago with sudden/random partial hearing loss. I am back with more answers. (Kinda)

I’m a former choir student, piano player by ear, and have forever loved music so passionately. So this has been a devastating blow for my mental health which has already been deteriorating since as long as I can remember, but music and singing and playing instruments was always one of few things that brought me pure pleasure and joy in life.

Reverse slope for me, is the inability to hear lower pitch &amp; frequencies. (Deep male voices, bass, thunder, cars engines) which makes sense because my poor husband has been having to repeat himself whenever he’s on the left side of me— my left ear has severe nerve damage. While both ears have nerve damage from unknown reasons I’ve yet to find out (if I ever do) 

So that’s what I’m dealing with. Hearing aids is the only thing the audiologist recommends me to do for a better quality of life, I asked if this was nerve damage was permanent and he said yes, when untreated it will progress as I age. So hearing aids. I’ve been wearing them about a week now. And the difference is insane. I’ve no idea how to explain what this feels like because my brain is still not comprehending the nerve damage diagnosis, im not comfortable that it hasn’t been detected how this even happened. 

Like I said before, I literally woke up one day and my left ear was not receiving auditory feedback or certain volumes at 100% capacity, everything felt like it was at a minimum volume of maybe 30 out of 100. Lots of pressure and pain within my ears and head. I asked the audiologist why I was in a lot head/ear pain. He said my brain is connected to my ears, with pain receptors going in overdrive basically since my ears have nerve damage, my brain was overcompensating with trying to keep up with my hearing? (My apologies for not having a coherent explanation, what he said made a lot of sense but im having difficulty relaying his explanation in my own words lol) 

TLDR: Basically brain got angry and stressed with my ears failing with hearing due to nerve damage so that’s why the inside of my head and ears felt like fucking shit for several months.

Umm, but yeah, 1 week in so far with hearing aids secured. I wear them every day at work. They help a lot with hearing. It’s VERY overstimulating when I’m in noisy environments and I feel like I could explode. Luckily I can just turn them off. Problem solved. But the overstimulation is going to take a long time for me to adjust to, I already have ADHD. Sigh. And the pain kinda seems to be slowly alleviating. I’m only 1 week in. But fingers crossed. 🤞🏻 

I just want to know how nerve damage happened bc wtf. Audiologist says i am his youngest patient to experience this.

I think we’ve had our hearing aids for about the same amount of time. My audio programmed a front mic setting for when I need to listen with intent and focus, as I’m also ADHD. Hearing everything again is so overstimulating but I kind of can’t get enough of it.

You sound like you're similar to my hearing loss...mine is genetic on my dad's side. But I can't hear low tones as well as I can high. I taught myself piano when I was a little girl. It was so cathartic I miss playing.

1kgu6ly,HearingLoss,Hello looking for some UK advice please,"I’ve been having issues with hearing - specifically low voices/ noises and conversations in background noise. I turn up the bass when I listen to music to the point my kids say it’s too much bass. I have to have subtitles on the tv. If I’m at a concert I can’t hear what the person next to me is saying, or understand what the singer is saying when he’s talking. My kids tell me I speak too loudly even when I think I’m being quiet. I also have tinnitus constantly. I struggle to work out where a noise is coming from eg if I hear a siren I have no idea where it is. Music sounds muddy to me. I can’t really hear individual instruments. My son has a really deep voice and I struggle to work out what he’s saying a lot of the time. 
But I went for a hearing test this morning and it was normal. My left ear is slightly worse than my right but all sounds were heard above or on 20db. She did a speech test but it was a woman’s voice and I don’t have any issues with higher pitches. 
What should I do now? Is there anything at all I can even do? It frustrates me so much and I have to concentrate so hard on conversations if they’re not in a quiet room that it exhausts me. I have no problems at all when it’s quiet around me except that makes my tinnitus worse and much more noticeable. I guess I just have to put up with it?

I'm not sure that you need a specifically UK response, as these things are universal. However I'm in the UK if that helps. 

It sounds like you have hearing loss and are unhappy with the hearing test results. Perhaps get a couple of others done elsewhere? I experienced hearing loss suddenly a couple of years ago and my first test was at an NHS hospital - the person delivering the test wasn't very good and the results clashed with my own experience. I went on to get tests at private places - Boots and Specsavers , and the testing there was much better and they listened to what I said about my hearing experience. 

For the specifics of the other things you mention - I use subtitles all the time on TV now. Hearing people speak in noisy environments (concerts etc) is just not possible and hearing aids don't really help in those circumstances I'm afraid. 



Tinnitus is a pain in the arse, but I don't think there's much to be done about it - I've grown habituated to mine so I can hear it if I try, but don't notice so much otherwise .

I would def ask for a referral to ENT. Yes the wait is long but you may as well be on the list. 

I have a hearing aid for similar level of problems and I do find it really helps. Also the doc explained to me how tiring it is to be struggling to hear all the time, which can then make it all worse as your brain is maxed out.

Sounds like you have hearing loss or had an ssnhl attack and recovering now.

Could you please write some dates and time lines? Like, ""it all started at this date with this symptom and it had been like that and it's been like this ever since another date.""

I just saw your audiogram... I think you have hidden hearing in the form of cochlear synaptophaty.",2025-05-07 10:41:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kgu6ly/hello_looking_for_some_uk_advice_please/
1kghkc4,HearingLoss,Questions About Sensorineural Hearing Loss,"I was diagnosed with moderate to severe Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss by an ENT doctor on April 21st, with the onset of the hearing loss occurring on April 3rd. I had gone to Urgent Care two times before seeing an ENT, and they originally diagnosed me with ""fluid in the ear"" and had me do a low dosage of Prednisone.

I did the high dosage Prednisone taper after seeing the ENT doctor, and my hearing test results were the same after as they were before. I just had my first steroid injection today, and for those who have suffered from SSNHL and had the injection, how effective was it for you? And, if it was effective, how soon was it until you started noticing improvement?

My doctor also recommended hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Did any of you see more improvement after doing that versus the oral steroids/steroid injection?

Sorry for the SSHL.  It sucks hard.

The day after I got SSHL I went to UC.  The Dr said it was fluid behind the ears and gave me Prednisone.  

5 days later when it was clear my hearing was not improving I set up an appointment with a highly regarded ENT / Audiologist clinic.

2 days later I met with the Audiologist.  She thoroughly tested my hearing and told me the hearing in my SSHL ear was basically zero.  

The ENT gave me 3 Prednisone ear injections over the next week but no improvement.  HBOT was discussed but didn’t seem promising so I didn’t pursue it.

2 months later I decided to go the Cochlear implant route and I am glad I did.  The biggest benefit for me has been restoring my ‘directional hearing’ so I can now tell what direction sounds are coming from.

Hope this helps.

I’ve had injections for SSHL and it was not effective at improving my hearing.

Hi,

I had two injections and had no improvement. Turned up for the third injection and they told me there was no point in having it. 
No improvement in hearing since.

1kg2eio,HearingLoss,Unilateral hearing loss and constant tinnitus,"UPDATE: receive MRI results, they have found a nodule which they suspect could be an acoustic neuroma. Having to go for another MRI with contrast this time to determine whether it is an acoustic neuroma or not. 

Hi everyone. Just looking for other people’s experiences with unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.

My symptoms started back in December 2024. I woke up one morning with a blocked ear (right ear). I managed to unblock it but then it would block again. It did this multiple times a day for about a week until one day my ear wouldn’t unblock at all and hasn’t since. My hearing in that ear has been very muffled ever since. The tinnitus started about a month after, it is 24/7 hasn’t gone away since it started. I have seen ENT they said my ears look clear there are no obvious signs as to why I have hearing loss and tinnitus. I have had a hearing test that shows moderate hearing loss in that ear which means I have nerve damage in that ear. ENT doctor asked me if I’d had a virus/cold before all the problems started with my ear, which I hadn’t. She also asked if I’d been exposed to loud noise or which I hadn’t. She couldn’t understand why I was having these problems with my ear and has now referred me for an MRI in a few weeks time. I’m worried that it could be an Acoustic Neuroma.

Has anyone else had same symptoms? What was the outcome? Anyone who’s had an acoustic neuroma were your symptoms similar to mine?

Thanks x

Same symptoms and timing here. I had zero cold or flu symptoms. I just woke up one day with it. I have a regular ENT (lots of sinus issues) and got in to see him pretty quickly. Did a massive prednisone dose.  

Official diagnosis is SSHL with moderate to severe hearing loss in one ear. Likely caused by a viral infection   Just finished a trial run with a hearing aid. And I’m going that route.  

My ENT also recommended an MRI. it’s pretty standard to rule out the rare scary stuff.  

One thing I’ve learned in the past 5 months I how common this is.  Find a new ENT.  He or she should have at least awareness of this.

ETA: this sub and the monohearing sub have been great resources and support.

With all due respect your ENT should tear her diploma and start another career. Where did you find that doctor? Ssnhl is so common and it's like the only real ent emergency.

It could be a number of things, one being ssnhl. Check with a doctor urgently.

There is a similar case where he reported that he couldn't hear anything and then his hearing came back out of nowhere. The doctors said that it's normal, where it's normal for hearing to come and go out of nowhere.

1kfyjms,HearingLoss,I'm losing my hearing NOW,"As the title of the post suggests, my hearing is not that great. 
I've had birds - amadins - living at home for 12 years. During this time, I've gotten used to waking up to their singing every morning. So, lately, every morning I realize that I hear them less and less. My hearing is getting worse almost every day, and I can't find the reason. My general well-being is also bad. 

I've already gone to all possible doctors. I've taken a bunch of tests that were prescribed and that I came up with myself - all in vain. All the results are within normal limits. 

It's like we live in the 21st century. And everyone has ""artificial intelligence"" in their pocket. But medicine seems to be 40 years behind the present.  

Sad. Very sad.
Take care of yourself, your hearing and your health in general!

You need to find the right audiologist. Sometimes hearing loss can be “hidden”, or there can be processing problems separate from an actual measurable loss. The right audiologist will work with you to find a solution. 

What outcome are you hoping for? It might help to be upfront about your desired outcome. For example, when I saw the AuD I ended up staying with recently, I said “I know the loss isn’t going to be striking on an audiogram, if it shows up. I have tinnitus. I want to be treated, I can’t keep living the way I am” and I’m now in my first pair of HAs.

Do you have objective findings? Such as audiogram results?

I lost 12 dB of hearing in one ear without any apparent reason—no ringing or other symptoms. At the time, the head doctor told me I had a wax plug and mild external otitis. After taking the prescribed medication, I regained about 5 dB, but my hearing never fully returned to what it was before.

I don’t want to come across as a know-it-all. I’ve noticed that I sometimes write in this community without considering others, and I can be a bit blunt. That said, I’ll be direct: please see a doctor who can test for possible autoimmune issues or ischemia. It could be something vascular or inflammatory. Even stress can cause damage to hair cells through oxidative stress. Genetics can also play a role—in my mother’s case, it was vascular, and she gradually lost her hearing over 30 years.

Get checked by a doctor who can run the right tests and offer proper treatment. You might even be able to recover some of your hearing.

It is affecting my work and I can't hear what people are always saying or mishear what they say and they have to repeat it. It can happen close by or faraway.

However I don't have any puss or blood come out my ear. It is a bit painful tho when pressure is applied like when I hiccup for example.

A sudden loss of hearing is considered a medical emergency', you need to see an ENT specialist as soon as possible. The longer you delay the worse the outcome is likely to be!

give some time for the steroids to kick in. another audiology test once you're done with the tablets, if no improvment then steroid shot in the ear. 

sorry you're going through this, it really sucks!

You might ask about a steroid shot.  That has brought my hearing back when this has happened to me.

1kez6zg,HearingLoss,Has anyone dealt with a completely normal hearing test but literally can't hear anything in loud/noisy environments?,"I work at a movie theatre and it's not the movies that are the loud part, it's everything behind concessions: the ovens, popcorn popper, ICEE machine freezing/defrosting/churning. And customers talking and laughing and whatever in the lobby. It gets so noisy and I can't hear *anything*.

I have to lean across the counter to hear orders, I'm constantly asking ""sorry?"" or ""what was that?"" whenever coworkers talk to me. Or ""did you just say...?""

But when I got a standard hearing test it came up that my hearing was normal. When it's quiet I can hear perfectly fine.

Anyone have any experience with this aside from ""well, it's loud."" And any idea what I do about it because it's very problematic or what I ask/who I ask/consult about this?

I have similar problems understanding what people are saying if there’s background noise and my audiologist said it’s probably an auditory processing issue, because my hearing was excellent. There aren’t treatments or assessments available under my health insurance for that, so that gave me an explanation but not a solution. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and I’m currently seeking an assessment for autism, and I think auditory processing disorders are pretty common with both of those.

Sounds like your ""standard hearing test"" did not include SIN (Speech in Noise) testing. That's what you're looking for.

Look at ""hidden hearing loss.""

1kekt5k,HearingLoss,"Hearing Loss, Dizzy Spells, and a Rollercoaster on Prednisolone—Labyrinthitis? Meniere’s? Something Else?","Hi everyone! 

I wanted to share my journey in case anyone else has gone through something similar. It’s been a pretty stressful two weeks, and I’d love to hear if anyone has recovered fully—or if this sounds more like labyrinthitis, Meniere’s, or something else entirely.

A bit about me:
I’m in my late 20s, a trainer and very active. I eat well, do CrossFit a few times a week, and don’t usually get sick. So this whole experience really hit out of nowhere.

⸻

Timeline of Symptoms + Treatment:

The week before I was extremely stressed and anxious.

Friday, April 25:
Woke up with my left ear feeling muffled. I didn’t think much of it—just assumed it was a blocked ear or sinus pressure. Tried popping my ears, blowing my nose, etc., but nothing worked.

⸻

Sunday, April 27:
Still no improvement. I felt a bit off but went out to dinner with a friend in a loud restaurant. That night, I got hit with sudden vertigo—room-spinning, couldn’t stand, nauseated. I went to the ER and got an injection to stop the vertigo.

⸻

Tuesday, April 29:
Saw an ENT specialist. Hearing test confirmed mild hearing loss in the left ear.
Doctor prescribed:
	•	Prednisolone 60mg/day (30mg AM + 30mg PM)
	•	Serc (Betahistine)
	•	Nicergoline
	•	Vitamin B12 (Mecobalamin)
	•	Omeprazole to protect my stomach

⸻

Wednesday, May 1:
Hearing came back!!! , but I had horrible insomnia from the steroids. I called my ENT, and she said I could stop the Prednisolone since I was feeling better.

⸻

Friday, May 3:
Hearing dropped again in my left ear. Called the doctor back, and she told me to restart the full 60mg of Pred, but take it all in the morning to help with the sleep issues.

⸻

Saturday, May 4:
Took the full dose at 8am and went back to sleep. A few hours later, I woke up with hearing restored, but was hit by intense dizziness and nausea (not spinning, but very off). Ended up hospitalized for the weekend due to the dizziness.
Doctor said the dizziness might be due to my hearing fluctuating rapidly.

⸻

Sunday–Saturday (May 5–11):
Doctor tapered the Prednisolone: 30 → 25 → 20 → 15 → 10 mg.
I felt normal again—hearing was clear, no dizziness, no vertigo. Finally started feeling hopeful.

⸻

Saturday, May 11:
Muffled left ear returned, but still no dizziness. I was concerned but waited to see if it’d improve.

⸻

Sunday, May 12:
Woke up with worse muffling, very similar to day one. Hearing test showed hearing loss again in the left ear.
Doctor put me back on 25mg Prednisolone for another 5 days.
After taking the dose, I felt dizzy while standing, so I lay down and napped for 2 hours.
Woke up with hearing restored, and dizziness slowly faded.

⸻

Monday, May 13 (tomorrow):
Scheduled for an MRI to rule out anything more serious.

⸻

Right now:
	•	My hearing only improves when I’m on Prednisolone, which is kind of scary.
	•	I’m 2 weeks into this and can’t function properly off the meds.
	•	I’m a trainer and can’t work when I’m dizzy or hearing is muffled—it’s affecting my daily life and mental health.

Doctor says I have inflammation of the nerve in the inner ear, but didn’t label it clearly. I’m wondering if this is:
	•	Labyrinthitis?
	•	Meniere’s disease?
	•	Or some kind of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss?

⸻

Has anyone here experienced something similar?
	•	Did your hearing come back fully?
	•	Did it stay stable off the steroids?
	•	How long did it take to fully recover?

I’d really appreciate any stories, advice, or reassurance—thank you so much in advance!

I'm not a doctor and I don't know what's going on with you. But I sincerely hope that you'll recover and forget about this as a bad dream. The main thing is to believe in the good, think about the good, and rest more. I also wish that you never have a reason to contact this subreddit again.

I have pretty much the same problem. Started about 12 weeks ago, ENT put me on a 50mg of prednisone for 5 days and then slowly dropping to 40-&gt;30-&gt;25-&gt;20-&gt;15-&gt;10-&gt;7.5 -&gt;5-&gt;2.5-&gt;1.25 every week.  Problem is that every week (even on 50mg) I had 3 days of good hearing, 3 days of bad hearing and 1 day of full dizziness and nausea, every week it'll start the cycle again. now I was supposed to stop but my hearing is incredibly terrible, so I jumped back to 7.5mg in hopes things will get better. I also have some feeling of discomfort in my jaw joint, I suspect it's ETD but doctors said it's impossible since my tympanogram is looking perfect. I'm not really sure what to do either because the loss if left untreated it can become permanent. :(

Went threw it took me 1 yr and half to get better. Caused me get sinus issue due to ear trauma but bothers when I drive threw mountain or planes . Also forgot all ent in usa suck I got hearing aids and more stuff just drained my insurance so I went to Mexico and they put me on steriods shots for 6 months that's what helped me get better.
My accident was due to extreme pressure burst /blast in the oilfield was out of it for 7 months could drive at all .

Wow! Honestly experiencing this at the same time. I’m 33 male, work in high stress environment - sales.  I experienced my first dizziness/ vertigo experience 18th of April, 2025.

Timeline of symptoms;

18/04 - First attack: I was having lunch with friends when out of no where! My head starts spinning, at first thought I assumed I got food poisoning - I completed just closed off from everyone and was in my head. The vertigo turned into nausea, I stood up and wobbled to the toilet where I vomitted!!! 

I told my mates that I needed to leave as I thought I got food poisoning. 

Went home and slept.

19/04 - 21/04 - Felt a whole lot better , just took panamax pill assuming nothing much as first. Did experience any other attacks or symptoms, I think I might have been a bit tired but didn’t think too much about it.

22/04 - Woke with Tinninus and my right ear kinda blocked. That’s when I knew this was serious. I booked an appointment for 2 days later with the ENT, after doing my own research I found out that the best/most effective time to start treatment was within the 72-hours of your first attack which I missed !!!!! 

24/04 - My doctor said it was Labyrinthitis   Prescribed steroids 60mg to use for 2 weeks straight and few other pills (one for stomach issues, one for dizziness and another for nausea). The doses would type off slowly after the 2 weeks.

25/04 - 29/04 - First few days on steroids, seen a slight improvement's mainly the tinnitus. Ear fullness was still present, the main issue I was experiencing during days were the dizziness that was happening in RANDOM moments that I couldn’t predict. I experienced dizziness once just talking to someone at home and another time while walking to an appointment.  To be honest, these first few days I felt really depressed - felt like this crippled me and my everyday life. 

29/04 - 02/05 - I felt like the steroids were helping at this time,  I started to sleep and rest a lot. Think I started to sleep about 7-9 hours per day, which I believe definitely helped a lot with recovery. Honestly - if this is happening to you, try having a hot shower at night and sleeping early. I know it’s not much to go on but it really has helped a lot. Also for food, increase your potassium and lower your sodium intake. Sodium increase blood pressure which plays with fluid retention in ear. 


03/05 - I woke up with the biggest Tinnitus I experienced since the start of my treatment, felt absolutely stress but I stopped the negative self talk and just went out for a walk, it didn’t help so I went back to sleep for an extra hour or so and boom! Felt so much better. I’ve been eating fruits, drinking about 4 litres of water and literally resting 16hours per day. Also, WFH for the last 2-3 weeks. My performance at work has taken a hit but told my manager this might last for a few more weeks. 

My biggest advice is TAKE IT EASY!! Rest a lot, reach out to friends and family for support. I’ve also discovered my triggers for headaches and dizziness are loud / crowdy environments. Not sure why but when I see too many people in a tight place (e.g. train carriage/ elevator) I feel nausea haha. I try avoid places that are busy. 

Hope you get better, let us know how you get on! 🙏🏾

It’s like my ear drum is going in and out, or like when you clear your ears for pressure but it just does it.  It makes it very hard to talk to people, and hard to hear what others are saying, and it seems to happen more in loud spaces, where I have to talk loud.  I also have temporal mandibular joint disorder, so a lot of clenching, and from that I have tinnitus.  So, like my hearing is going downhill.  But I’m wondering if there is a surgery I can get for my floppy eardrums.  Thanks for any help in naming this condition.  I am going to make an appointment at the an ENT in my area to get this figured out, and maybe fixed.  It’s very distracting, like it makes it hard to even speak one sentence.  Every other word changes my hearing.  It used to happen infrequently, but now it’s every time I go out.  So frustrating.  😕

TMJ can absolutely cause Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) ....Does this sound like your problem?

Do you have any problems with your nose and throat? Maybe your nose is stuffy and your throat is swollen?

Go to the otologist,  make sure there's not any fluid by an infection causing this. As a hard of hearing person I learned ""the hard way"" that the key with most ear/hearing problems is preventing asap before is too late to recover what you can lose or lost.

Do you mean you keep feeling like your ears are stuffy and you need to 'pop' them to equalise the pressure? Like hold your nose and try to blow until your ears feel clear- but then it doesn't last?

I had this sensation so I was ""popping"" them many times a day. When ENT looked they said I was doing it so much it was making my eardrums loose and floppy.

In actual fact I had mild hearing loss but my brain was interpreting the loss of hearing as stuffiness. Every time I popped my ears my hearing *seemed* like it was better for a few minutes, but in actual fact it wasn't, it was just that my brain expected an improvement, if that makes sense?

I was told to stop popping them, no matter how much it felt like I needed to and the sensation would eventually go (it did) and my eardrums would improve (they did) and I chose to get a hearing aid to help with the hearing. Also other strategies such as just recognising that maybe I need to lip read, turn the volume up more etc- just acknowledging the actual issue and addressing it was helpful.

Sorry if I've misunderstood your meaning and this is not relevant! If it is, I'd advise a hearing test!",2025-05-03 04:12:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kdkb2z/please_help_me_put_a_name_to_my_hearing_problem_i/

I am worried that I won’t be able to continue this job as I age, but wanted to look at other options anyways. Going back to school is not off the table for me, but I don’t want to commit to a job that I’ll have difficulty in due to my hearing loss.

I’m a lawyer. It’s occurred to me that if hearing aids don’t improve my condition I’m going to have to focus on research and writing and stop doing trial work since I’ll have trouble hearing witnesses. But I’m hoping the hearing aids will help.

lol I’m speech language therapist that went deaf in my left ear last June. I thought I was done bc my job requires me to have very precise hearing to discern correct and incorrect speech sound production. I got CROS aid that allows me to hear my students ok to better than ok in my quiet therapy room. Put me in the lunch room or a recess and u can’t hear anything. Just yesterday, I was evaluating a student and caught a very slight lateral lisp that no one else had commented on. I continue to do my job well and am very glad I have my CROS aid!

I’m a librarian but I work for a vendor selling books to libraries. I’m not sure I’d be able to go back to being a children’s librarian in a public library since my loss is pretty significant and I struggle with background noise specifically. Libraries are noisier than you’d think! Especially for storytime

I'm a teacher, I have mild hearing loss in both ears but due to another condition it was recommended I only use one hearing aid. It was borderline whether I even needed hearing aids as my hearing loss is quite mild. I got one to try and I really feel it makes a difference especially at work, in busy restaurants, pubs etc.

I still struggle a bit if kids mumble but otherwise ok. 

I'd say try hearing aids if you can!! They just make it all slightly easier and this less frustrating and tiring.

I work for NYC local city agency and process paperwork. It’s very rare that I speak with people over the phone but when I do, I use an app called Nagish which transcribes phone calls.

This is so important a topic because it deals with providing for us and our families…hearing is essential and it’s still a struggle to find decent care and insurance almost never covers it 100 percent!  Not to mention sometimes our spouses don’t understand our struggles

Because of family history with hearing loss, I realized early on that I probably shouldn't rely on my hearing. Although I was a talented musician, I decided being a professional musician was too risky a career (plus the average pay is abysmal). I leaned into my logical side, got a degree in computer information systems, and took a job with an IT company as a programmer. IT programming can be done with limited verbal interactions, which is the key. **Think about jobs you can do with limited verbal interactions.** There are loads. Some examples - analyst, accountant, graphic artist, writer, scientist.

This being said technology (including HAs) can help tremendously in jobs that require verbal interaction. In fact, my career progressed such that my computer programming turned into IT consulting. Before video meetings became commonplace, HAs helped me tremendously. I really did not miss much, because of them, even though my hearing continued to decline. Today, I spend half my day on Zoom calls, which allows me to tailor the volume of people's voices and provides closed captions. So, most **any job you can do via video conference** would also work well.

I run a bakery. It can occasionally be annoying when I can't hear customers (especially the ones who mumble) and I generally don't answer the phone, but it's not that bad, otherwise.

A filmmaker / video editor - it does have its challenges in the audio side, less the creative element but more so working with left and right ear tracks and any panning audios. Filmmaking / cinematography it’s probably more a hindered of attention, if I’m focused on filming I don’t have the auditory awareness if something / someone is near me.

I'm a psychotherapist. Hearing loss doesn't affect my career even though I have aids in both ear.

Edit: aids should massively help you in your job and look into if the phone you use is ""hearing aids compatible"", if you're struggling already you could always look into having them sooner

I work in supply chain, most of my interactions are either through email or zoom/ teams (where I can turn up volume or turn on closed captioning.)

I was in business development. Found that I could no longer hear people in many situations - meetings in large rooms, business social events etc. I have had to pivot to a more desk based admin type role and thanks to Covid and the advent of Zoom meetings where I can turn up volumes etc, I can now (largely) get by. Still have occasions where face to face interactions are unavoidable and sometimes go belly up, but as these are far less frequent now, I can fake it until I make it.

I have moderate hearing loss in both ears. I cant hear frequencies in women’s vocal ranges very well. 

I’m a professor, and so it meant I couldn’t hear students well at work unless we were 1-on-1 in a small quiet room. I recently got hearing aids and it’s a night and day difference. My audiologist said to go ahead and get them since it was negatively impacting my work. Outside of work my life isn’t such that I feel like I need them on all the time

I'm a lawyer and a teacher. I often have to ask the students to repeat but a school is a really noisy environment in general. The legal part is usually okay because I work one on one with clients

Look into being a hearing instrument specialist! I'm currently going through a program now at the Hearing Aid Academy. You'll help other people with hearing loss and can most likely have better access to lower cost hearing aids and whatnot by being in the field. It has been rated as one of the best jobs and best paying jobs you can get without a college degree and the field is booming right now and will continue for a long time. Research hearing instrument specialist (sometimes called hearing aid specialist or hearing aid dispenser).

I’m hearing impaired, and my hearing has declined with age. I’m 65 and retired now, having worked as a municipal Parks employee. I was fortunate not to face many of the challenges that people with hearing loss often experience, since I worked outdoors and mostly on my own. You’re still young, and if you can find a city job—especially one that allows for independent work—that could be a great fit. I hope you find what you’re looking for. If you're female, lots of female workers doing outdoor work too.

I respect what you do but you don't have to think it's the end of the world. You can't remain a receptionist forever, so move on and find something more ambitious, something more courageous to do. Set a higher ambition or growth for yourself, think of your strengths and not your weaknesses.

I was diagnosed with mild hearing loss 3 years ago and I wear hearing aids (Audien Atom Pro 2) now. They help me a lot but I've also had to adapt my work environment. I used to do customer service but I pivoted to a computer-based gig where most of my communication is via chat/email. It was a tough decision but I've found it a much better fit. If you're worried about the future, maybe look into roles that are less reliant on constant verbal communication. And tech is always advancing so who knows what might come out by the time you're ready for a switch.

I was a medical office receptionist until I retired at 65. The last 5 years were full of phone amplifiers and stronger hearing aids. I had to quit my medical transcriptionist career of 20 years because of my hearing loss. At the front desk at reception, I could read lips and understand the clients fine. When masks happened, I couldn't work anymore.

1kcl4zo,HearingLoss,Ruptured left eardrum,"Hi! Hoping to seek some advice. Today is Thursday. On Tuesday, I noticed what felt like an ear infection coming on. I made a Teleadoc appointment and I was prescribed an antibiotic ear drop. Wednesday morning, I woke up for work and the pain was unbearable. I asked my boyfriend to put the ear drops in my ear and he noticed there was a ton of blood. I ended up going to urgent care where I was told my ear drum is ruptured and Teleadoc was treating me for swimmers ear, which was making the rupture worst. Urgent Care gave me ibuprofen 800 for the pain and oral antibiotics. 

I have called off work 2 days in a row as the pain is not getting better. My jaw hurts too and I have a constant headache. Ear is muffled and can’t hear anything. 

Has anyone gone through a similar experience? How long does it take for the pain to go away? 

Thanks for your help!

I've had ruptured ear drums from ear infections before. I seem to remember the pain being the worst just before the rupture. The rupture releases all the built up pressure. Either way, I don't remember pain lasting more than a few days.

A lot of your pain may be actually from your jaw. Are you trying to move your jaw a lot in hopes that the ear will pop and suddenly feel better? If you do that too much, your jaw hurts and it's so close to the ear it ends up feeling like the ear is hurting. Basically your jaw swells and puts more pressure on the area close to your ear.  Try not to grind your jaw around. 

I would suggest...
Keep on track with the antibiotics. Don't miss any doses. 
Keep up with the ibuprofen.  Even if you think you can wait a while, don't wait.  Be strict with the schedule.
You can take Tylenol along side ibuprofen safely. Do that too. Try alternating times. Ibuprofen then 2 hrs later Tylenol, then ibuprofen and so on. That way you've got a constant medication going without the effect wearing off.

Also warm moist compresses work great. A really warm wet washcloth held on the top of the jaw and over the ear will feel really good.

You could also try some decongestants. They will help open things up in your ears a little and let things flow. I like Flonase because it's a nasal spray and it has a steroid in it to reduce inflammation. 

Try running a vaporizer or sitting in the bathroom with a hot shower running. Breath in all that warm moist air. It will help and feel good.  When you go outside, put a cotton ball in your ear too. That will help it feel better. 

As always, if no improvement in a few days, go back to the doctor. They may need to change the antibiotic, steroids, or some other treatment.

Bottom line though, for your ear to be infected enough to rupture, you've gone through a lot. It may take a little longer than you'd like to start feeling better. And your hearing will be messed up during this healing time, so that should be expected.  

You'll get better. You're just at a really sucky part of the process right now.

How you doing gurlll, going through the same thing right now, ruptured my eardrum last saturday night, went to urgent care on Monday, they prescribed me Cefdinir(mouth antibiotics) and Ofloxacin(eardrops). Yesterday morning my pain had gone away and then it came back at night, been home all week HATE THIS",2025-05-01 22:10:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kcl4zo/ruptured_left_eardrum/

Hello, the image is cut off a bit, but without any more information or history: this appears to be a 'conductive' hearing loss of the lower frequency tones (low pitches) affecting your \*right\* ear and a (likely) an age-related 'sensorineural' hearing loss of the higher frequencies (high pitches) affecting \*both\* ears (right and left). Your word recognition scores are good (100%), but it required fairly loud volumes in both ears.

I can provide more help if you could share a few answers to the following questions, but feel free to DM if you prefer. Did they happen to do tympanometry (ear drum pressure test)? Other important factors in helping decide what to do include: your approximate age (even just 10-30; 30-50; 50-80+) and whether you had a cold recently, sinus infections, ear infections, history of loud noise exposure, history of ear surgery, or a history of smoking cigarettes. Were there any other recommendations (tests, referrals, and/or hearing aids)?

Some general information below. The ""Conductive"" component of hearing is essentially the first of two major steps in hearing (soundwave enter ear canal, then the ear drum and ear bones pass the signal to the cochlea). ""Sensorineural"" component is the second major step (cochlea detects the sound and passes it to the brain). A Conductive Hearing Loss generally happens when there is fluid or something else restricting the movement of your ear drum or ear bones. Conductive hearing loss can also be due to an unusually large amount of earwax blocking in your ear canal, but even less common for it to only affect 1 side, and the report states 'otoscopy' was 'clear', which usually just means there was enough open space in your ear canals that the ear drum was visible. I imagine they at least did not see ear wax build up on your right side.

In adults who smoke cigarettes and have one-sided, conductive hearing loss, it is important to rule out any masses in the back of the nose and throat. This is because the middle ear actually drains into the back of the throat, and if something is blocking that tube it would cause the ear drum and middle ear bones to not function correctly. If so, I'd recommend seeing an ENT so that they can look in your ears and take a look at the back of the throat (with a small flexible camera) to make sure there are not any signs of a tumor. Once that is ruled out, other causes of one-sided conductive hearing loss can also be discussed with an ENT, but none are quite as urgent.",2025-05-01 15:59:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kccalz/can_anyone_please_tell_me_about_my_hearing_loss/
1kc7wlk,HearingLoss,Hearing loss in one ear after swimming in the ocean,"I went on vacation to Florida and did a lot of ocean swimming. I woke up one day during the vacation and couldnt hear out of one ear, feeling like it was clogged and full of fluid. I tried the swimmers ear drops and earwax drops, nothing worked. 4 days later they looked in my ear and saw some redness but were baffled that I had no pain. They irrigated the ear and gave me antibiotics. I’m on day 4 of the antibiotics and nothing has changed. I’ve tried Flonase, stomping up and down with my head tilted to get the fluid out, nothing. Just tinnitus and muffled hearing.

I don’t know what to do if the antibiotics don’t work. I’m terrified I will be stuck like this forever. Any ideas or experiences to share? Do I need to get my ears surgically drained? Is time of the essence?

I am going to see an audiologist in a couple of weeks for official report and diagnosis i am pretty sure i need hearing aids

This isn't enough to suggest that this loss is tied to loud noise exposure specifically. You're right; a test like this isn't going to be accurate, and seeing an audiologist is going to give you much more meaningful answers. We don't know anything about your hearing history, what dB level of music you're being exposed to/how often, and really enough about how this test is structured and set up. And yes, if this was ""close enough"" to your hearing, you could absolutely benefit from hearing aids. This is a pretty dramatic loss for your age.

Bro I’m a 22 yo male too and I’m cooked just like you. Except that my hearing loss is unilateral (right ear normal, left ear severe). It’s sad that we got this mf type of disease in our prime years. I’m too young to accept hearing aids in my life, yet people be like “You should embrace it! HL shouldn’t be stigmatized!” But it’s easier said than done. Anyways good luck I hope everything turns out good.

This app is super accurate with the right headphones, I use Sony wh 1000 xm5 and it's giving me whatever a pro pta would give. 

You should see an ENT first and yes you will benefit a lot using hearing aids. Best of luck.",2025-04-30 21:01:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kbrahr/this_is_my_unofficial_hearing_test_can_someone/

1kbl4x7,HearingLoss,3rd update about claim denial for sshl. https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/s/51exbx2PDU,"Refresher. I had a bout of sshl. Ent couldn't see me so I went to ER. ER coded my visit without mentioning sshl and wasn't an emergency. Insurance denied the claim because of non emergency use of the ER. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/s/51exbx2PDU

I went through the patient advocate from the hospital. I told him everything that happened. My history with sshl and how the doctor in the ER had never heard of sshl.  I explained how the doctor was very dismissive of my symptoms. I opened my records up to them for review to see my history. Advocate asked me if I wanted the bill deleted or what. I said I'd love that, but at least have the billing codes corrected to show sshl and that it was an emergency so my insurance can pay it. The man was very nice and seemed to be perfectly understanding and on my side. 


Got my letter from them today and it basically says ""we did everything right and you still owe us $1300"". They said the doctor did nothing wrong. My treatment was proper. They said they reviewed the coding and it was accurate. So they're doubling down on the visit not being an emergency. 


I'm baffled that a team of medical experts deemed my sshl visit non emergency. Now I'm past the deadline for an appeal through the insurance company unless they view this as a new claim, even though it's the second time around.


I haven't heard or talked to the insurance company yet. The claim isn't showing up with them yet. I was so sure that, once presented with all the information, they would plainly see that sshl is a valid reason to visit the ER. I'm not exactly sure what I have to do right now or what the next step is. I've only had the letter for about 15 minutes, but I wanted to update those who responded to my last 2 posts.

I'm sorry I'm not from US so I'm not entirely sure legally what you need to do here but I think you could easily sue the insurance company because ssnhl is literally one of the most well-known (and important) emergencies of ENT.

I’m sorry to read this, and can only imagine your frustration. I would absolutely be reaching out to speak to the insurance company and see if they can help. Explain prior history, and what led you to the ER. Be gracious with whomever you speak to, as you catch more flies with honey. See if they can fight on your behalf. Any time I have received a bill from a doctor/hospital (when I know I shouldn’t be receiving said bill due to my insurance), my first point of contact is my insurance company and they have handled such things for me.

1kbfh5j,HearingLoss,Help! Mother has gone almost completely deaf over past three months and nothing is helping. Eustacian tube dysfunction suspected.,"
I am going to preface this by saying that she refuses to go to the doctor because she almost died once when a hospital gave her a numbing agent. That is off the table for now unless I can convince her that a doctor could do something other than give her drugs to help her. 

Around three months ago, I had a severe episode of postural vertigo following a viral illness that resolved itself with rest and Flonase. My mother then caught that viral illness and a couple weeks later, my mother began having episodes of intense vertigo and vomiting that lasted entire days. She is basically opposed to any kind of modern medicine but finally agreed to take nauzene and the vomiting stopped. Eventually the vertigo resolved as well mostly.

HOWEVER, during that time, she initially would have periods where her hearing would go out, and then it would come back. I noticed a correlation with barometric pressure being high making it worse and drinking hot liquids and eating spicy foods making it better. It was usually worse in the morning and better in the evening. I suspected eustacian tube blockage, and tried to help her pop her ears but she cannot and says she can’t remember ever being able to. I bought her a Eustaci device, as well as packs of balloons to blow up and gum to chew and made sure she used them correctly but none worked. 

Now, she is pretty much deaf and cannot hear any kind of background noise or things like the door opening. She claims she can still hear some but it’s obvious she is reading lips. She insists that hearing aids won’t help because her ears “Ring” but that been an issue for her before she lost her hearing and she thinks that is the sole reason why she cannot hear but she also says that now she “Feels noise” and it feels like thumping in her ears which is what happened when my ears were blocked. I got a bebird and looked in her ears. No wax whatsoever. My ears are similar, however, I had ear tubes. Her mother also went deaf at this age.

This hearing loss is a huge issue because she is a therapist and has to have the volume on her computer so high to hear that I worry it’s harming her ears. 

We tried ear buds which helped but made the hearing loss worse, and I wonder if bone conduction would help or make things worse given the blocked eustacian tubes. Any suggestions on possible ways to get her to pop her ears or ways to drain her eustacian tubes, or suggestions of hearing aids that would help without making things worse would be very much appreciated.

Unfortunately she will need to have a proper hearing test to figure out her type and level of loss and assess any damage to her ears.

She needs to get to an ENT and have her hearing tested by an audiologist.  If they can not fix her ears, they could give her HAs.  I have a birth defect that has caused permanent ETD on my left side.  I get ETD on my right side but can sometimes clear it doing the valsalva maneuver.  

She needs someone to take a look.  Ear infections are treatable.  Viral infections are not.  Fluid in the ear is treatable.  Some ETD is treatable.  Sudden sensineural hearing loss is treatable sometimes if caught soon enough.

She needs to get herself to an ENT who can decide if she can be helped or not.  But unless she has a medical degree she is NOT qualified to make that decision.  Oh, and give her a hug and tell her not to be so stubborn.",2025-04-30 12:41:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1kbfh5j/help_mother_has_gone_almost_completely_deaf_over/

I feel so bad that i wasted lots of my hearing for that but music has always been a comfort for me, an escape from reality when things got bad. I preferred to have a music on full volume to silence my thoughts. 

I do have tinnitus but its really manageable as i barely hear it. My biggest struggle is that i hear less from my right ear and this misbalance makes me uncomfortable. And pretty aggressive too. 

Ive already tried limiting music, and put a limit on my phone to stop blasting it into my ears. I considered going to an audiologyst or whoever treats ears but i feel so ashamed i was the one who ruined my own hearing. Hope y'all are having a good day thanks for reading ts. 

Also do u recommend any good amazon earplugs? 

[댓글]
I don't know what earplugs to recommend to you. But I can definitely recommend the following: 


1. Don't listen to music louder than 80 dB. But at the same time, listen to music as long as possible at a lower volume. It's best through speakers. Open headphones are also not bad. In-ear headphones are the worst. 


2. Go to an audiologist and check your hearing now. It's very important to record this right now, you need a starting point. You don't have to explain anything to the audiologist. Just say that your hearing has gotten worse. Save the audiogram, it will come in handy in the future.

Hi, don't feel bad or ashamed,  this is common when teenagers are going through the musical phase,  we all did it.  Ask your audiologist about the cause,  maybe it could be an infection, sudden or unknown, impacted earwax or taking certain antibiotics. Even if it was by loud sounds (which most times exposure by loud music is not imposible but it can be unlikely unless you did it 24/7 every single day for a very long time) you didn't know  what you know now. Thumbs up for knowing now that you have to control the volume, now you learned to never do this again and take better care of your hearing. Besides that, always have self compassion, it is more difficult to cope with the unknown when all your life your hearing was okay. In the phase of adaptating with this new reality we need to always be gentle with ourselves to control/ handle better the emotions about our disability,  and to not let the disability or others opinions to control us.",2025-04-28 20:42:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ka61kx/music_and_hear_loss/

1. Pure Tone Audiometry (first image)

The first image shows a pure tone audiogram, which measures how well you hear different frequencies for the right and left ear:

Prawe ucho = right ear

Lewe ucho = left ear

Graph axes:

Horizontal axis: Frequencies in Hertz (Hz) — from 125 Hz to 8 kHz (the usual speech range).

Vertical axis: Hearing thresholds in decibels (dB HL) — the lower the point, the worse the hearing at that frequency.

What the symbols and lines mean:

○ — air conduction thresholds for the right ear (headphones)

X — air conduction thresholds for the left ear (headphones)

— bone conduction (BCL, via bone vibrator)

V — no response for bone conduction (hearing loss too severe)

Interpretation:

Right ear:

Hearing loss is moderate-to-severe.

Hearing thresholds are approximately 50–80 dB across different frequencies.

Best hearing is in the 250–1000 Hz range, with worsening at higher frequencies.

Left ear:

Hearing loss is severe.

Thresholds are worse, around 70–90 dB across various frequencies.

Almost no response at higher frequencies.

This ear hears significantly worse than the right ear.

PTA — Pure Tone Average (mean hearing threshold):

Right ear: PTA = 70 dB (or 63 dB)

Left ear: PTA = 85 dB (or 69 dB)

(Sometimes two values are given — depending on the calculation method.)

2. Speech Audiometry (second image)

The second image shows the speech audiogram (Audiogram mowy).

Horizontal axis: Sound intensity (dB SPL).

Vertical axis: Percentage of correctly recognized words.

What the graph shows:

At very low sound levels (below 20 dB SPL), speech understanding is almost zero.

Around 40–50 dB SPL, speech recognition exceeds 50%.

To achieve nearly 100% word recognition, the sound needs to be played at around 60 dB SPL or higher.

Interpretation:

There is a significant hearing impairment: you need considerably louder sounds than a person with normal hearing to understand speech well.

Without a hearing aid, speech understanding in daily life would be limited.

General Conclusion:

You have moderate-to-severe to severe bilateral hearing loss.

The right ear hears better than the left.

Bone conduction thresholds are also decreased, indicating sensorineural hearing loss (damage at the level of the cochlea or auditory nerve).

Speech discrimination is reduced — especially at normal conversational volumes.

1. Audiometria tonalna (pierwszy obrazek)

Pierwszy obraz przedstawia audiogram tonalny, który pokazuje, jak dobrze słyszysz różne częstotliwości dla prawego i lewego ucha:

Prawe ucho = prawe ucho

Lewe ucho = lewe ucho


Osie wykresu:

Oś pozioma: Częstotliwości w hercach (Hz) — od 125 Hz do 8 kHz (typowy zakres mowy).

Oś pionowa: Progi słyszenia w decybelach (dB HL) — im niżej znajduje się punkt, tym gorsze słyszenie przy danej częstotliwości.


Co oznaczają symbole i linie:

○ — próg przewodnictwa powietrznego dla prawego ucha (słuchawki)

X — próg przewodnictwa powietrznego dla lewego ucha (słuchawki)

&gt; — przewodnictwo kostne (BCL, przez wibrator kostny)



V — brak odpowiedzi w przewodnictwie kostnym (zbyt duży ubytek słuchu)



---

Interpretacja:

Prawe ucho:

Ubytek słuchu umiarkowany do znacznego.

Progi słyszenia wynoszą około 50–80 dB w różnych częstotliwościach.

Najlepsze słyszenie w zakresie 250–1000 Hz, pogorszenie w wyższych częstotliwościach.


Lewe ucho:

Ubytek słuchu znaczny.

Progi są gorsze, około 70–90 dB w różnych częstotliwościach.

Prawie brak odpowiedzi przy wyższych częstotliwościach.

To ucho słyszy znacznie gorzej niż prawe.



PTA — średni próg słyszenia (Pure Tone Average):

Prawe ucho: PTA = 70 dB (lub 63 dB)

Lewe ucho: PTA = 85 dB (lub 69 dB)


(Czasami podaje się dwie wartości — w zależności od metody obliczeniowej.)


---

2. Audiometria mowy (drugi obrazek)

Drugi obraz przedstawia audiogram mowy (Audiogram mowy).

Oś pozioma: Natężenie dźwięku (dB SPL).

Oś pionowa: Procent poprawnie rozpoznanych słów.


Co pokazuje wykres:

Przy bardzo niskich poziomach głośności (poniżej 20 dB SPL) rozumienie mowy jest prawie zerowe.

Przy natężeniu około 40–50 dB SPL rozumienie mowy przekracza 50%.

Aby osiągnąć prawie 100% rozpoznawania słów, dźwięk musi być podany przy natężeniu około 60 dB SPL lub wyższym.


Interpretacja:

Występuje istotne upośledzenie słuchu: potrzebujesz znacznie głośniejszego dźwięku niż osoba z normalnym słuchem, aby dobrze rozumieć mowę.

Bez aparatu słuchowego rozumienie mowy w codziennych warunkach będzie ograniczone.



---

Ogólne podsumowanie:

Występuje u Ciebie umiarkowany do znacznego oraz znaczny obustronny ubytek słuchu.

Prawe ucho słyszy lepiej niż lewe.

Progi przewodnictwa kostnego są również obniżone, co wskazuje na niedosłuch odbiorczy (uszkodzenie na poziomie ślimaka lub nerwu słuchowego).

Rozumienie mowy jest obniżone — szczególnie przy normalnych poziomach rozmowy.",2025-04-28 13:04:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k9v1jb/how_bad_is_it/
1k9s94i,HearingLoss,"Chronic Ear Problems Since Childhood, Considering Canal Closure Surgery (Need Advice)","Hi everyone,

I was born hearing completely, but at 2 years old I started losing hearing in my right ear. Chronic infections (without pain, only itching) destroyed part of my eardrum before anyone realized. I had a tympanoplasty (eardrum transplant) as a child, but sadly my body rejected it a few years later.

Since then, I have lived with around 25% hearing on my right side. I can't allow water into my ear, which affects my daily life a lot, washing my hair, swimming, even being near water games is stressful. I sometimes have but deep infections with pain and itching, and an awful smell, and I live in fear of getting worse.

Recently, and after 26 years of having this problem, my ENT, that has been with me since the beginning, suggested that I might be a candidate for ""canal closure"" surgery (also called ""blind sac closure"") to stop the infections and improve my quality of life.

Has anyone here gone through a similar experience?
Has anyone done canal closure surgery?

I'd love to hear your stories or advice.
And meet people who have the same issue has me 🙂

1k9qjaf,HearingLoss,How to know between APD and hearing loss?,"I work in a restaurant and have extreme difficulty understanding speech both in the dining room and in the kitchen. The kitchen is VERY noisy and the dining room isn’t loud but there’s a constant hum of background noise. I used to think I had good hearing cause I can clearly hear my parents talking from the other side of the house and loud sudden noises at work like two dishes hitting each other seems to startle me way more than any coworkers. 

But yet I can’t understand people at all once there’s even a little background noise? I don’t get it. Is it my head or my ears? Or neither?

A hearing test.

My doctor said that based on what I’d described she’d reckon APD along with loss. In my case she said it’s not worth testing for as I show loss and qualify for hearing aids.

I thought I just had hearing loss. But I had the issue that too much noise just goes into one loud horrible noise

Almost all at some point.

If you're talking about chronic tinnitus in chronic hearing loss patients, I'll say 30 percent.

1k6vcx3,HearingLoss,Help understanding,"So I’ve been struggling with constant tinnitus in my ears (I think both) for about two months now. As well as dizziness and brain fog. I’ve been under massive amounts of stress for the past three months as well. I went to the ENT yesterday to address this and had my first hearing test done. (Results posted below). I was told I do not have Eustachian tube dysfunction, but according to the results they only checked my left ear. Why was I told I for sure do not have ETD when both of my ears were not checked? I should have asked while I was there but I was in the middle of a panic attack because I was told I needed to get an MRI to rule out a potential tumor due to my significant hearing loss on my right ear (left ear hearing is fine). The PA I saw was very blunt and cold, and I even explained to her that I was feeling really anxious at the moment because I’ve been struggling with health anxiety (a tumor being what my health anxiety is latched onto for some time now, too). Her answer was simply “we’ll see what the mri says but you have significant unilateral hearing loss in your right ear which is not common for your age”. 

I was also wondering- during the hearing test itself, I was fighting major anxiety, brain fog and borderline panic attack. When I was asked to repeat works back, I felt like I couldn’t focus and missed some words I could have probably interpreted properly if I wasn’t feeling the anxiety/brain fog. 

Could someone please offer any advice if they have gone through this, if the anxiety may have affected my results, why only one ear was tested for ETD and if there could be other causes to unilateral hearing loss other than a brain tumor. I have my mri on Monday but I’m spiraling with panic. 

Kindly, 
A very anxious lost person right now.

1k6dwpt,HearingLoss,I'm a little nervous for my son.,"I received this email from my child's school last week. Immediately we met with his doctor. He checked his ears for fluid or any visual signs on what may be going on. He was stumped and now we're waiting for a referral to another audiologist for further testing. He is severely ADHD. Not the cute forgetful type but the type that has created many difficult hurdles for him. Another question I have is why now? It seems we've had many different screenings and this seems to be out of the blue. I'm worried for him and I don't even know where to start. Any advice or words of encouragement is appreciated. Thank you all!

If you are not sure how reliable the behavioral results are, you can always request an ABR just to be sure!

I had a similar situation with my son this fall. He is 11 and never had an issue with a school hearing test until this past November. We were referred to an ENT and an audiologist. They confirmed his mild hearing loss and sent us for so many tests. We started with an MRI to rule out any deformity in the ear. Negative. Then we went for blood work. Normal then to a cardiologist to rule out long QT syndrome. It was a wild goose chase and I was extremely nervous the whole time. I think some of the testing was unnecessary. Long story short we still have no diagnosis. My advice is to get the MRI or some imaging to rule out inner ear issues. Definitely work with an audiologist who will do all the testing. Often times kids “fail” the test at school because of distractions and end up passing a more formal test in a sound proof environment.

Go to an ENTand audiologist.  As the previous poster mentioned, an ABR can be done if he's unable to listen.  I'm middle-aged now, but have had hearing tests since I was 5.  Here's the thing, would it be so bad if he has hearing loss?  It's treatable.  Your child could have  HAs to make listening easier.  If there's some sort of conductive hearing loss, sometimes that's treatable with surgery.  I had surgery every year from age 5 to 12 and felt so much better afterward.  Try not to worry.  A dumb thing to tell a parent.  But you're trying to make your child's life better, and that's wonderful.",2025-04-23 23:39:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k6dwpt/im_a_little_nervous_for_my_son/
1k6dphl,HearingLoss,Audiologist diagnosed me with permanent nerve damage in both ears and I now require hearing aids,"Hello, I’ve no idea how to begin with this I (f29) who never had hearing problems throughout my entire life up until several months ago. 

Disclaimer: I’ve developed 2-5mm in size (pea size) swollen lymph nodes sometime in 2023, been monitoring them, ran many many blood tests, ultrasounds and nothing is concerning to doctors, but they are located below my ears and will get inflamed every now and then, often accompanied with minor dull pain &amp; discomfort. Doctors think it’s allergy related and lymphatic draining. 

Sometime 3-4 months ago I developed discomfort, sharp pain, fullness &amp; pressure in my left ear and my head. This eventually led to hearing loss (partial) in my left ear the longer the months went by &amp; I’ve also gotten lots of ringing in my ears as of recent which wasn’t normal years ago. It’s been gradually increasingly noticeable that something was compromising my ears. 

I got referred to an audiologist, who was very informative, concerned, and very helpful and thorough with his testing. I met him today for testing, he did 5 different types of tests. “Good news &amp; bad news” he states. Physically speaking and visual-wise my ears looked to be working and functioning as normal, no signs of needing surgery and etc. But he said the bad news was permanent nerve damage, in both my ears, not just my left one which was causing me a lot of distress this whole time. My left ear just is more damaged than the right ear. 

I’m unsure how to cope and digest all this new &amp; scary information, as I was informed it progresses as I get older if untreated or not using hearing aids. I get my hearing aids very soon so hopefully things will look up soon. Im a music lover, a singer, I used to play piano &amp; losing partial hearing has been very difficult and I was scared I would permanently lose my hearing if I never got answers.  

The doctor that referred me to audiology kinda called me a hypochondriac before I got the hearing test done, so I feel very invalidated and infuriated because I was starting to think maybe I was being dramatic and “it was all in my head” I kept thinking I was overthinking and exaggerating. But I guess there was nerve damage in both ears. I’ve no idea how that even happened. That’s been a little unsettling to digest as well.

Hi! We are similar in age. I am 28F &amp; just got my hearing aids a few months ago. They will take getting used to but they will definitely enrich your life. 

It is difficult to process losing your hearing so young, that's an entire sense that you're having to come to terms with losing some or all functionality of, and only you can know how you feel with all that. Just know you're allowed to feel how you feel, no matter how dramatic it seems to others or even yourself. Let yourself be angry, be sad, mourn the loss etc. But just know that there are things out there to help you. You're on the right track with getting help and hearing aids. And I just wanna say that you're not alone 🫶🏻

I really do wish you the best, I hope you get used to your hearing aids quickly &amp; seamlessly.

id any disease diagnose you with auditory nerve loss? Loud ringing and vertigo, and sudden loss could be autoimmune vascular, Meniere's. Although Meniere's does not kill the nerve but the hair cells, COVID attacks in general and causes pain and sudden loss.

Does your hearing loss entail a loss of clarity in sounds rather than a change in volume or is it a more “traditional” case of stuff sounding quieter?

Did the dr ever say what caused your nerve induced hearing loss?

Had to get a hearing aid at 35, from sudden hearing loss in one ear. Presumably from Covid. It’s hard to come to terms with. There are worse things out there but it doesn’t really make me feel better. Any feelings you have are definitely valid. I think frustration with doctors ignoring, and incorrectly treating hearing issues like this is a common experience we all have. Sending support your way!

This is surreal to read, I just turned 30 and had gone to a audiologist since I had tinnitus as of recent months and slightly muffled hearing. She said I had hearing loss in both ears. I had ear infections as a child and a recent one time sinus infection but never thought my hearing was so bad. I went to urgent care and was told there was fluid in my ears, they gave me a 6 day dose of meds which I took and it relieved some pressure, I followed up with an ent who said there's no fluid, I do have allergies which may contribute bur do have hearing loss and nerve damage. I'm waiting on a CT scan and allergy test, but I'm really stunned I'll need hearing aids at barely 30. I'm scared and can't help but worry if I'll lose my hearing.

how do they detect if you have nerve damage? which tests",2025-04-23 23:29:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k6dphl/audiologist_diagnosed_me_with_permanent_nerve/

The audiologist didn’t explain much to me and I don’t know what to do next. Should I get hearing aids or not? How much do those cost? 

[댓글]
Hearing aids are very expensive but it looks to me like you could benefit from them. i dont have experience with OTC hearing aids but with moderate loss they may be good and cheaper

I am currently trialing Sennheiser all day clear over the counter hearing aides. They're $800 (or at least they were on sale, $1000 regular price but it looks like they're maybe on sale all the time.) they have a 45 day free trial when you buy through soundly.com

They're working well for me, my loss is less severe/different from yours. But for the free trial, unless your insurance has really fantastic coverage it might be worth trialing these first🤷. I've noticed a big difference in my speech comprehension. And for me, in a few years I know I'll be hitting my health insurance deductible for other reasons, so if I decide I want prescription aids at that point, they would be a lot cheaper then.

""Should I get hearing aids or not?"" you would benefit from pair of well adjusted hearing aids IMO. Most sellers allow for trial and you can wear different brands free of charge for some time before chosing the one that fits you best.

 ""How much do those cost?"" Hearing aids are expensive. From around 2k to 4k EUR for a pair. I think everywhere in EU you will recieve money from public health for aids and for molds seperately. Depending on where you are you can benefit from other financial support. I'm from Poland and after getting the required papers I managed to lower the cost by around 40%

""I also have pulsatile tinnitus"" me too, sometimes it scares me a lot in the middle of the night when it rings in the most intensive way. During the day I'm trying to not pay attention by focusing elsewhere. My tinnitus gets just worse when I'm intentionally noticing. Hearing aids cancels this sensation almost completely so its a big relief if you find it uncomfortable or worse.

It's time to research.  Find out if you have a hearing aid benefit and how much insurance would pay.  My next choice would be Costco.  OTC....you have different hearing in each ear.  I'm not sure how well this would work.   Perhaps it would be OK if you can input your audiogram.   Still an audiologist or Costco is preferred.

I think it depends, do you have trouble understanding speech? Do you experience difficulties in your day to day activities?

Your loss would do well with hearing aids, but as others have pointed out, they are expensive. I always tell my patients if you feel you need help, it is time to get hearing aids. If you feel you are okay, and it doesn’t bother you, don’t worry about it right now.

1k5qv6y,HearingLoss,Why I find tinnitus and hearing loss hard to accept,"I got my tinnitus and hearing loss from being kicked hard to my ear in an MMA spar on 2/23/25 (2 months ago). It was dangerous kind of kick where my sparring partner speared me and I believe he had malicious intent but that’s a long story for another post. Here, I want to focus on why I feel it’s been hard for me to accept. I really feel that my value of health and being grateful to not have tinnitus before having tinnitus worked against me. I feel I lived life the right way but I just got extremely unlucky.

Throughout my life, I had a lot of health problems, especially neurological disorders (including autism), but managed to reverse things that were thought to be irreversible. By habit, I'm constantly working at being healthy and trying to bulletproof myself. I value my mental health perhaps more than anything. Within the week before I had gotten tinnitus, I was researching how to prevent vision loss and I noted to myself to research preventing hearing loss.

About 5 years ago, I knew a person who had tinnitus. He was a very angry guy in general. He would tell me how awful tinnitus was and how there’s no cure. I was very grateful not to have it. Perhaps on a weekly basis, I would think of this and appreciate not having it. I loved being in my quiet room and just appreciating the silence.

I've also gone through years and years of a whole variety of hardships. I managed to get through them with mentalities such as “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger."" Now, I'm not sure I believe that anymore; sometimes things debilitate you. Another mentality I had was “I’ll endure this now and have a better future later."" I want to believe I have a better future but right now, I feel I don't have the emotional bandwidth to truly believe that. Before tinnitus, I would meditate on noticing thoughts and feelings come and go. However, this doesn't agree with a condition that has no cure and could potentially persist for life. I don't meditate anymore because I end up focusing on the ringing.

When dealing with the many toxic people throughout my life, I would find comfort in knowing that they are separate from me and can be cut out of my life. The one toxic person who is the most difficult is a sibling, who may be around for life, but at least is separate entity and not something in my head. At the time I got kicked, I was going through a lengthy process of standing my ground against this sibling to not take her bullying anymore. Then I got kicked and it made all the problems I had prior seemed so small. Another mantra I would use was ""sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me."" Yeah I know it's a thing kids say but it's true. Unfortunately, it was metaphorical sticks and stones this time.

To express how much despair I was in; I really thought I only had 2 days left to life, enough time to tie loose ends before opting out. I had worked hard for a good life. I was achieving my dreams. I felt strong and sharp. I had a good life ahead of me after so much hardship. I had the vision of a toxic-person-free life. Then, when I’m almost in the clear and almost done facing the big-bad in my life (my sister), some stranger sparring partner inflicts takes that away from me. Then, I might never be in the clear as this might persist for life.

I know there are people who get tinnitus or hearing loss and it doesn't faze them at all. Others can't take it and opt out. Others, it debilitates them. I feel that my strengths worked against me. I feel my values, mentalities and gratitude were very positive things and I can’t be hard on myself for them backfiring on me.  I'm trying my best. I would appreciate your thoughts.

[댓글]
it's not that your values and mentalities are not backfiring. it is still early days to completely accept the hearing loss and the tinnitus. when it happened to me, I stopped listening to music for 3-4 months. I did some therapy to help me deal with this. I was grieving and it was normal to feel this way. I got closure the moment I accepted that it simply happened, I was just unlucky (like you said).
you sound like a strong person, but I feel like you should be more kind to yourself. 

and I'm of the belief that you cannot really bulletproof yourself, not physically at least. life has its ways and we cannot control everything. 
mentally, yeah, you can work on that. but again, give yourself some time and grace to deal with this.

1k56fxx,HearingLoss,I can't seem find a clear answer on internet Low frequency vs high frequency hearing loss,"which is worse having low frequency hearing loss or high frequency hearing loss- which is more common for high decibels sound exposure: which person has the overall have a harder time distinguising speech. thanks 

[댓글]
There are way too many factors to get an overall answer which is probably why you're struggling to find one!

High-frequency loss is usually age-related whereas low-frequency loss is almost always congenital. Adapting to hearing loss is tough and usually comes with a lot of emotional impact from losing functionality and sounds you enjoy, which people who are born with their hearing loss don't experience - but on the other hand being born with it is more likely to cause speech issues, lack of access to education/careers/social opportunities etc. Which of these is 'worse' definitely depends on the person!

Speech sounds are mostly in the middle frequency ranges so both high and low frequency loss can affect speech comprehension, which is 'worse' depends on the level of loss and how far across the frequency spectrum it extends.

Most background noise (especially at a distance) is low-frequency, so people with unaided low-frequency loss generally have less issues understanding &amp; discriminating sounds in a noisy environment whereas people with unaided high-frequency loss usually struggle with this a lot because they hear the background noise but less of the other sounds. If the person uses hearing aids the opposite is true though - aiding high-frequency loss adds in the sounds the person's missing with minimal increase in background noise so it usually helps a lot, whereas low-frequency loss is notoriously difficult to aid because any frequencies you add for speech/useful sound also adds more background noise. 

Pure noise-induced hearing loss is usually flat or cookie-bite (affecting all frequencies or the middle range respectively), although since most people with cumulative noise damage are also older it often also includes an element of age-related high-frequency loss.

I have low frequency loss. Here’s my experience- environmental sounds like thunder and cars are not audible which can be dangerous. I feel bass but don’t hear it. Mens voices are tough for me. It confuses people that don’t understand why I hear some things and not others. 
I do wear hearing aids but still struggle with background noise and I can’t localize sound at all. It annoys me to no end when I ask someone where they are and they answer “here.” I can’t speak to how people experience high frequency loss but I am sure that is pretty frustrating.

typically noise induced HL starts with high frequencies, but it depends on the sounds your exposed to. theres really no worse or better type of loss based on frequency (unless it is high frequencies above 8k hz). look at the speech banana for more information

Hey OP, hope all is well! 
It is subjective to say which is worse; one person‘s high frequency or low frequency loss is going to look different than the next. 
High frequency hearing loss is most common because we lose our high frequencies first when we lose our hearing naturally, whether that be age or noise induced. Low frequency hearing loss on the other hand often times is congenital or conductive, meaning that either they are born with something that is not working correctly, or perhaps something in the middle ear along the way has caused a hearing loss(rather than the typical sensorineural hearing loss caused by wear and tear of the hair cells in your inner ear). 
Low frequencies predominantly affect volume, base and richness; fans and motors, and overall volume. High frequencies on the other hand would be ticks and clicks and dings, birds and consonant sounds that affect clarity and diction of speech(not necessarily volume). Both can be difficult to get used to and learn to re-process if you’ve had loss for a long time before treating it. Both are definitely treatable and many people are happy with hearing aids with both low and high frequency hearing loss. 

To answer the questions directly: 
Most common from noise exposure - High frequency hearing loss 
Overall harder to distinguish speech - High frequency hearing loss (consonant sounds that make up the beginnings and ends of words are soft, high and effect clarity. Did she say “what time is it?” OR “what kind is it”? “I heard you but I didnt understand you”) 

Hope this helps!

It's entirely subjective which is why you don't have a solid answer.

Low frequency HL is when a person can’t hear well sounds like thunderstorms, fridges vibrating, airplanes’ engines when on the airplane. High frequency HL is when a person can’t hear well sounds like birds chirping, sirens wailing, and females’ speech. The worst one to have for a human life in general is high frequency hearing loss because high frequency sounds are important for speech clarity, especially in background noises and especially when trying to listen to a female because females have speech frequency higher than males’ and also the more common one is high frequency hearing loss.

Doctor and low frequency hearing loss patient here.

Low frequency is worse, period. The reason for this is HAs almost never works well in low frequency hearing losses. Tho one might argue without HAs, considering mild to moderate loss, low frequency hearing loss has an edge over high frequency in speech discrimination.",2025-04-22 13:34:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k56fxx/i_cant_seem_find_a_clear_answer_on_internet_low/

1k4txwu,HearingLoss,Terrible visit to the Audiologist/ENT,"Sorry for the long post in advance. My day has been awful and I just need somewhere to vent about it.



I’ve had hearing problems since I was in late middle school, a few minor ear infections here and there, and then one major inner/middle ear infection in high school, which resulted in a ruptured eardrum. I went to an ENT and had hearing tests done, showing mild to moderate biliterate hearing loss (which they told me was noise induced from being in band). I had a proper discussion with them about tinnitus, which had been an ongoing issue at the time. I had a diagnosis of notched hearing at 6000hz, with moderate hearing loss in my left ear and biliterate tinnitus. (They also said I had eustachian tube dysfunction, but I had no clue what that meant at the time…)

Since then, I have continued to have worsening tinnitus and ear infections, including two more major ear infections and one middle ear infection with an eardrum rupture. (Talking full eardrum takedown, I couldn’t hear properly for a few months.)

It should be noted that my hearing loss, tinnitus, and ear infections all affect my left ear more than my right. (I have never, to my recollection, had an ear infection on the right. Though my hearing loss is biliterate.)

Today, I went to the ENT. I had a hearing test, where they told me that my hearing loss has been miraculously cured! (Though they admitted to some slight discrepancies, and that my hearing in the left ear was a little worse than my right.) Anyway, my audiologist/hearing test results were released before I even saw the ENT, so I was already feeling terrible with my results showing that I have been imagining worsening hearing and tinnitus all these years. (I was already pretty upset, because I HAVE PERCIEVED MY HEARING LOSS GETTING WORSE, not curing itself.)

The appointment began with my ENT telling me the joyous news that I was cured. He then went on to say that my tinnitus worsening is caused by the MASSIVE AMMOUNTS OF EAR WAX in my ear and ear eczema, which, sure I could believe to a certain degree. However, after cleaning my ears, there was no noticeable difference in either my hearing or tinnitus so I’m a little confused by that.

He berated myself and my mother, who came with me because I get nervous in hospitals, for not establishing “continuity of care” in the providers I’ve been to regarding my ears. (Mind, I’ve been at university the past three years without visits to the ENT.) He then doubted the medical history I did have on file, including documented visits to my primary care provider for severe ear infections and eardrum ruptures.

Most of the things that he wrote in his **literally AI generated notes** post-visit were either incredibly rude, untrue, or a confounding mix of both. The first thing he wrote was, “The patient and her mother have the perception,” which I believe really set the tone for the rest of his notes, belittling me for being confused and “perceiving” hearing loss that was not there.

In his after visit notes, he made it clear that I was “teary,” “unhappy,” and “not pleased” to hear my prognosis and treatment options, one of which was mineral oil in the ear to soften earwax (which he told me and wrote, “I did explain that the mineral oil make it make it temporarily worse in the next 2 weeks as it softens the cerumen.” I work in customer service; I cannot lose the ability to hear people for the next two weeks. So I was obviously pretty pissed at that suggestion that he said “might” work.)

To end this incredibly long rant, I will close with one of his last remarks in my chart. He writes, “She was very unhappy and tearful that we were not able to make her tinnitus resolved today.” I was crying because he was horrible, and I was affronted and frustrated at his demeanor, not because my tinnitus was not cured. I don’t care whether my hearing loss has improved, or whether he was able to treat me for my tinnitus. I’ve been looking for answers regarding my ongoing hearing/ear-related issues for close to four years, and rather than listening to his patient, this doctor ignored and belittled me during my entire visit.

I’m thinking about writing to his office/the hospital where he works to let them know of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with my care. I’ve been waiting for months for this appointment and am just so disappointed it went this way.

TLDR – Horrible exam with the ENT, who was abrasive, rude, and dismissive of my ear issues. Did not listen to me or my concerns and doubted my medical history.

You should definitely report that.

How can you have normal hearing with massive amounts of wax?  That's not possible.  What moron does a hearing test without cleaning your ears first?  It would actually change the results.  Get yourself an otoscope off Amazon and see if you really do have massive amounts of wax.  

Get reccomendation for a decent ENT.  Ideally, take a copy of the first hearing test with you and see if they would be willing to see what your current hearing level is.  Also, if you do have a wax build-up call and make sure they schedule time to remove the wax professionally.  You'll need someone with a microscope.  

If he told you to use mineral oil to soften and make the removal easier, I'd understand.  In that case, I'd expect a follow-up appointment and a check to see if your hearing had improved.  Because with the ""massive"" amount of wax, there should have been hearing loss.",2025-04-22 01:05:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k4txwu/terrible_visit_to_the_audiologistent/

Would I still be feeling that fullness/plugged ear feeling after 6 days? Seems like my hearing is not as clear as the first day.

Yep, give it time. 

Depending on the type of packing they use it can take a week or two.

I remember the packing started to break up around day 10 in my case

Hi! I had a  tympanoplasty (quite similar to a stapedectomy) 10 days ago. My post-op appointment isn't for another 3 weeks (4 weeks after the procedure.) I definitely agree that my hearing got better initially (like the day after the surgery), then got worse, and now has plateaued. I'm still totally full / clogged, but am hoping that's due to the packing...I also have mild pain in the ear and a lot of itching. I hope that's just part of the healing process and not something else. While I haven't been jogging or anything, I have been walking a lot (and walking my dog)...None of it felt disruptive to my ear, but who knows...

Would you mind sharing why you went to the audiologist? Some background information?

How old are you and have you been exposed to loud noise?

I uploaded my results to chatgpt and asked it to give me detailed information but in layman’s terms and that help me

1. Audiogram (Top Left Graph):

Y-axis: Hearing level in dB HL (the lower the point, the worse the hearing).

X-axis: Frequency in kHz (from low to high).

Circle (O): Right ear, air conduction

Cross (X): Left ear, air conduction

Brackets (&lt;, &gt;): Bone conduction (if present)


Interpretation:

Right Ear:
Hearing loss starts around 30–40 dB at 2 kHz and progresses to 80–90 dB at higher frequencies (4–8 kHz). This indicates a moderately severe to severe sensorineural hearing loss, especially in high frequencies.

Left Ear:
The hearing loss is slightly milder, starting around 20–30 dB and reaching 70–80 dB at high frequencies — suggesting a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss.

---

2. Tympanometry (Bottom Right):

The tympanograms for both ears (Tymp 226 Hz Right/Left) show flat lines with no clear pressure peaks.

This might indicate normal eardrum mobility if the graphs are simply not drawn correctly.

However, values like Vi = 0.00 ml are physiologically abnormal — suggesting the data was either not recorded or displayed incorrectly.

---

3. Otoscopy:

Right &amp; Left Ear: ""No Blockage"" — ear canals are clear with no wax or obstructions.

---

4. WR / SRT (Word Recognition / Speech Reception Threshold):

These sections are blank, so the patient’s ability to understand speech was not evaluated or is not included in this report.

---

Conclusion:

The patient has bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, more severe in the right ear.

Hearing aids are likely indicated, especially if the patient reports difficulty understanding speech.

Further evaluations are recommended:

Speech recognition tests (WR, SRT)

1k43x6f,HearingLoss,Do you consider yourself “Disabled”?,"Pretty much what the title says. Do YOU (not anybody else) consider yourself “disabled”? Why/why not?

[댓글]
Depends who is asking, there are work protections in certain countries / states for disabled people.  So i said yes on the forms for work but i am now self employed.

Yes. I'm disabled due to things unrelated to my hearing loss, but here is why I consider my own hearing loss to be a disability:

I grew up in the hearing world with no loss until I reached about 20. I do not know ASL, and still converse primarily in English. I am not active in the deaf community. I need accommodations due to my hearing loss to make life easier, but I could still function well in society without them if required.

'Disabled' is not a bad word, I don't feel lesser than my peers. As others said, it's similar to my glasses prescription. My sight is not perfect, but with a little help from glasses, it can be greatly improved.

I do consider it a ""hidden disability"" yes and therefore myself as disabled. but only because that's the only way others can understand that maybe everything doesn't work the same way for me as them

Thank you all for the wonderful responses! I was born hearing impaired or Hard of Hearing. I did not receive my first hearing aids until age 23. I cried the first time I heard birds singing! I never explored my deafness, just thought there were hearing people &amp; Deaf people, I was a “damaged hearing person.” Now, age 60, I am on a quest to live a healthier, happier life with whatever time I have left. And I MUST confront my deafness. Though I always paid lip service to the idea that being “disabled” wasn’t a negative, in my heart I believed it was! Now I’m exploring the possibility…the fact?… that I am indeed “disabled”. I should have asked these questions 40 years ago.. but here I am! I have never been around people like ME! So I am grateful for this group! I wish we could have dinner together! “Disabled” was never a club I wanted to join! But, in the end, yes I am “disabled”. Is it a bad thing or not? Maybe it just is, period. God bless all of you! I truly love the HOH/Deaf community! 🤟🏻

If I need accommodation, then yes.

I’ve no hearing in one ear and severely dead in the other. Disability is a condition that limits your senses or movement so I’m definitely disabled under that definition. 

I said to a (movement) disabled friend that I felt awkward using the term - like I’m not worthy of it, or trivialising ‘real’ disability. They found that to be ridiculous. They said their ability to freely communicate was as important as their mobility.

No. 

It isn’t any different from a person who wears glasses for me.

No - I'm part of a cultural minority. Yes it can have some disadvantages since our language isn't as widely used, but that's very different from being disabled. A hearing person moving to a country where they don't speak the language is quite 'disabling' too but nobody would consider it a disability

I've had fluctuating hearing my entire life on one side due to a congenital birth defect.  A year ago, I found that I now have a moderate reverse slope hearing loss in both ears.   Last fall, I got my first pair of hearing aids.  I can manage with or without HAs.  It's just draining to have to read lips as I am now relying on the visual input more  than auditory.

TBH, I guess technically, it's a disability.  It's definitely invisible as even doctors don't realize the extent to which I am lipreading.  Even when I tell them, they do not understand.  Without my HAs, sound doesn't really exist behind my back. 

Do I personally think it's a disability?  Hmmm.  A year ago, I'd have said no, I just adapted.  I've worked hard at figuring out how I hear.  The reality is it isn't just me adapting. It's my husband too.  He helps keep me safe so cars don't hit me when we go for a walk.  It is an invisible disability and I may need help from those around me.  Just a bit baffling to figure out what I need.  

Airports is my first thought.  What challenges might I encounter?

I have Ménière’s disease I consider myself disabled at times (vertigo/ balance issues) but not all the time. I don’t think in my head I’m disabled.

This is something I have thought about a lot, and thanks for opening up a conversation on this. 

I lost my hearing suddenly about 11 months ago. Now I have severe hearing loss on the left and moderate on the right ear. I am a Middle school teacher, and I wear hearing aids all the time.

Perhaps because of the hearing loss happening over less than a year, I definitely experience it as a disability. Even with hearing aids, I struggle to follow conversations with multiple people or to hear some of my quieter students. It has made my life much harder and I am frequently exhausted. 

That being said though, with hearing aids I am still very much a fully functional person and teacher. But then I think people with disabilities frequently are, unless the disability is not one that technology can compensate for. 

I found that communicating to others that I have a hearing disability has made it easier for them to understand they too have to make an effort. If my colleagues don't talk towards me, mumble or hide their mouth, I simply cannot make sense of what they say. If my shy students don't make an effort to speak up, I cannot understand them, no matter how hard I try. 

So yes, I definitely have a disability, but can compensate for it if others meet me halfway.

Per the ADA, “the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more ""major life activities,"" (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.”

So, are there “major life activities” that limit your participation in work?

1k41324,HearingLoss,Struggling to cope with hearing loss at 26.,"I’m currently 26, and have mild-moderate hearing loss in my left ear and mild loss in my right. I think my hearing loss is a combination of bad genetics, TMJ issues, and loud music.

I’ve always had poor hearing compared to my peers. I remember getting routine hearing tests done at my school as a kid when no one else in my class would get them. At the time I didn’t know why. No one told me I had hearing loss then. When I was 12, I was sitting on the couch and all the sudden my left ear started to ring and wouldn’t stop. My pediatrician referred me to an ENT and was essentially told I have a small amount of hearing loss in my left ear and that I’d have the loss and ringing for life. As the years progressed, I developed tinnitus in my right ear as well and the ringing in my left kept getting louder. I would avoid the ENT a lot, because I didn’t want to be told there’s nothing they could do again. My hearing loss was always mild, but didn’t affect my day to day life much at all at this time.

A little less than a year ago, I was sitting in bed and noticed that the ringing in my left ear  became extremely loud. Like to a point where it was so loud I couldn’t focus on anything else. I still struggle with this a lot to be honest, so many people say you learn how to ignore it and mine is so loud that I physically can’t. It’s absolutely debilitating. I went back to my ENT, he said I lost a little more hearing since when I last went back, but there’s nothing he can do and that I should see a therapist.

About a month ago, I noticed that I’ve been having trouble hearing clients and my coworkers at work. (I’m a receptionist) I can mostly hear what they say, but I’ve been struggling with the end of their sentences lately. I went in for another hearing test/ENT visit. The ENT said my test results aren’t too different from than when I last came in, but he wanted a CT scan on my ears. I have yet to visit my ENT to go over my results (I have an appt coming up), but my MyChart essentially says that my ears look “unremarkable”. I guess this means we still don’t know what’s causing my hearing loss and I’ve come to terms with the fact I’ll likely need hearing aids.

This is just really tough for me to digest because I’m already dealing with chronic pain, depression, anxiety, chronic dry eye, and type 1 diabetes (my endo insists my hearing loss isn’t related to my T1D). My insulin and diabetes supplies are already so expensive and I’m not sure how I can manage paying for hearing aids too. I quite like my job, but I’m worried I’ll have to find a new one. I already deal with a lot of brain fog and am constantly worried about developing Alzheimer’s/Dementia. I worry that my hearing will continue to deteriorate and that I’ll be deaf by the time I’m 40-50. I just feel hopeless. I feel like a genetic nightmare, and like I’m losing more of myself by the day. I just so badly want my body to be normal at something, and am finding my hearing loss very difficult to cope with. I genuinely feel old. Most 50 year olds I know are healthier than I am. I know that it’s not the end of the world, it just feels like it is. I just wanted to vent. I don’t want or expect sympathy or any magic cures.

I am 25 and have a list of chronic illnesses and genetic disorders. I also have mild to moderate hearing loss and we don't know what's causing it, so i can totally relate. I have not used them,  but look into vocational rehab. A lot of times I believe they will pay for hearing aids so you can continue to work! 

(Please anyone correct me if I'm wrong on the info on vocational rehab)

I'm 24 and was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss (probably otosclerosis) and bad tinnitus in my right ear in Aug 2024. No family history of hearing loss, never heard of it until I was in it. I just graduated.   
Me, too, was hopeless and literally contemplating ending my days, and then I was diagnosed with GAD and depression, and then everything was just messed up - I had no will to live, couldn't see my future with this constant ringing and hearing loss at all.   
But then life happens, and while struggling to survive one day at a time, I got better. Now, I don't think about my loss and ringing - even though it is there all the time - it just doesn't bother me anymore. 

Please, please, hang in there. It'll get better, I promise.

So uh. Have you been screened by a rheumatologist? Your story has a lot of similarities to mine, and I'm getting screened for lupus for the THIRD time now. I have moderate cookie bite loss and what has been labeled fibromyalgia. But there are enough suspicious things that aren't supposed to be fibromyalgia related that my audiologist is highly suspicious. I also had an episode of severe illness we couldn't figure out where my blood values were all kinds of fucked up and I was negative for everything. And I had covid once which apparently my audiologist has had a lot of people come back with worsened hearing loss after covid. I'm similar to you, just trying to find out why my hearing is going and if we can stop it. Because there is zero family history for me of cookie bite loss or any hearing loss for that matter in younger people. And I REALLY cannot do my job if I go entirely dead, it won't be safe. T1 diabetes is also usually autoimmune right, like your immune system attacked your pancreas?

Probably not what you want to hear but it can always be worse. You don’t realize it can be worse until it actually gets to that point. I starting having hearing lose back in November and It was draining and depressing. Then most recently I’ve been having vertigo daily, which doesn’t happen to everyone but I will say, it’s terrible. I’d rewind time and take some hearing loss and having to say “what” 50 times a day over constant dizziness. You don’t realize how much your life is affected when the world is constantly spinning. On the bright side, I’m taking medication for dizziness that seems to be helping quite a bit but just a some insight.

Sorry to hear what your going through. I just recently lost hearing in my right ear, I have the same thing. I bought a cheap heron age from Amazon for about $20. It works.
It's hard accepting it for me too. At i'm sixty eight years old but it is what it is and I just try to wear that when I need it
It was from a bad sinus infection that was not treated. So I hope you find this solution

1k3yp4x,HearingLoss,Hearing loss from deviated septum/ enlarged hypotrophic turbinates?,"Long story short.....had a horrible case of flu in January. Like the worst in decades.....2 weeks after a sinus infection. Took weeks to get over.....and had an ear infection, as well. In the middle of the illness my right ear became congested. Fast forward....3 months later and it is still muffled.....like I am 10' under water on the right side. Went to ENT last week and had a sinus CT that revealed severe s-shaped deviated septum with a spur along with enlarged hypotrophic turbinates. Could this be a reason for the hearing situation? Going in this week for a temproal CT......could these issues cause Eustacoan tube dysfunction.

I don't want to give you false hope here, but i was in a similar situation for years with hearing on my right side sounding like it was weirdly underwater. As an audio engineer this was debilitating. I also had a severely deviated septum with deep bone spur and enlarged turbinates, which my first ENT glossed over. Multiple hearing tests came back clear..tried eustachian tube balloon dilation with the first guy..nothing seemed to help. Finally went for a second opinion with a new ENT and ended up having septoplasty with turbinate reduction two weeks ago. Within 2 days my hearing almost fully returned and i'm told is likely to fully considering the hearing tests had passed with flying colours and the spur is now gone. Amazing!

The bone spur was apparently applying an immense amound of pressure near the eustachian tube, also causing one of my eyes to be lazy which is fixed too. This is 100% worth looking into.

I could, but I don't think so. The question is, do you still have inflammation, are you still congested? I don't think so in the septum, unless there was something previously, as for the muffled sound, I definitely don't think it's your inner ear, it's more something in the middle ear that's failing. I would look more into how to get rid of the congestion and inflammation. Something similar happened to me in 2012, after an ear infection, my hearing returned to normal after almost 7 months.

Your story is so similar to mine. After a horrible cold nearly 1 year ago my left ear never stopped feeling full and it's like I can never clear it out or fully pop it. I did all the basic ENT tests that showed nothing followed by nasal spray and months of waiting. Here I am 1 year later with no resolve. A CT scan yesterday showed a severely deviated septum. Still waiting to hear from the ENT what this means for me.",2025-04-20 22:49:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k3yp4x/hearing_loss_from_deviated_septum_enlarged/
1k3trcn,HearingLoss,Kinda need someone to tell me this is normal and things will be okay.,"I posted before about losing the hearing in my left ear on 4/2, I already have severe hearing loss and the inability to process speech on the right side. 

Well after peoples encouragement I advocated for myself and was able to be seen for intratympanic steroid injections on day 9 after onset (rather than over two months out like I was scheduled) I also was put in a high dose of oral steroids on day 7. On day 14 I started mild HBOT. I’ve been doing everything I can. There’s been little change. 
Day 3 I woke up with no hearing on the left side. 
Day 6 some of the muffled sound didn’t seem quite so muffled. 
Day 7 saw ENT and audiologist for the first time. 
Day 9 intratympanic steroids
Day 16 it was clear that while there are still issues that things were getting better as my new ENT wasn’t having to shout for me to hear him. The buzzing still threatened to drown out sounds making it very hard to process words but it was improvement. And it was the only thing keeping me holding on. 

However. Day 19 from onset I woke up with even less hearing that I did on day 3. It’s like the last couple weeks never happened. The buzzing is still present but now I have the same type of ringing on the left that I’ve had on the right since 2016. I cannot even hear myself speak. I rolled over in the morning to ask my husband what he wanted for breakfast and jolted out of bed cause I immediately understood what was happening. 

Does anyone have experience with SSHL that experienced a similar type of regression during recovery that ended up getting some of their hearing back? Because I can barely function. I feel like it’s all been for nothing and I just had the rug ripped out from under me. Like the world is playing a sick joke on me. It was slowly getting better. I was learning to live with the loss. I was trying to accept that the buzzing would never go away and I needed to learn to accept it. And now… I feel so hopeless.

I feel for you. I have rapidly progressing hearing loss and I can’t take steroids anymore because I had a bad reaction the last time. It’s hard to watch life slip through your hands. Especially since I’m healthy and this is really my only issue. The one time steroids worked for me I had a setback over the weeks following. Not completely but enough to get depressed about. Ugh

I am sorry that you are going through this. But if it offers any form of encouragement, I recently had an almost similar experience. Lost 80% of my hearing in February 19th. Started oral steroids about a week after, but was told my dosage was too low by another ENT so it was upped from 30 to 80mg. Did that for another week but my audiometry was completely messed up. Went the intratympanic route but after the second dose, a repeat audiometry showed that I had even lost more hearing. At this point I could only hear with my left ear. The doctors decided to place me on a long course oral steroid and slowly taper it down. It’s been 3weeks now, and the hearing is back 80%. During recovery, its normal to experience fluctuations in hearing. A clear sign of improvement that I found was an increase in tinnitus. I could get a very loud day of tinnitus and the next day, I have gained some db in hearing. Read that it was a sign of the hairs waking up, and trying to recalibrate. If you loss is recent, you have a good chance of gaining back a lot of hearing.

One thing I didn't understand, did you have tinnitus post SSH? Many cases of covid ended in SSH, but in your case it could be vascular to autoimmune, there are cases where hearing was recovered but they are rare, I had a loss of 15 db in my right ear but they still don't know the cause, I still haven't removed the wax plug that is supposedly responsible, well good luck you could see cochlear implants have improved a lot and you can listen to music directly from your cell phone many say they hear much better than before well it depends on the case

I also had a high dose of oral steroids and it was great the first 4 days, after that my hearing got worse, then it got better, then worse again. 

Do you by any chance consume a lot of sugar and/or salt ? Steroids with sugar and salt can really mess up how your body handles liquids and pressure in the ear.

Your case is eerily similar to mine. Here I am a year later and have two hearing aids. Steroids briefly helped but now I can barely hear my own voice. The hearing aids have saved my sanity, but what a struggle it is .",2025-04-20 18:57:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k3trcn/kinda_need_someone_to_tell_me_this_is_normal_and/
1k3l3c9,HearingLoss,Pregnancy and otosclerosis,"I am a 31-year-old female and I was diagnosed with otosclerosis roughly 11 yrs ago. I got a hearing aid back then, but haven't really used it much during the past years as the hearing loss has progressed and I don't really notice any benefit from it. PTA in the worse ear is now 34 dB (I got it tested this week. Hearing in my other ear is still absolutely normal. No surgeries.

I don't think I ever processed the diagnosis mentally and I guess I didn't really understand it fully then. You could say I just tried my best ignoring it and actually succeeded pretty well. As of recently, I decided that I can't hide from it anymore and as a result, I have become absolutely terrified of the disease. I can't eat, sleep or study and all I hear is my tinnitus. I am just so scared of becoming deaf.

One thing I am scared of is the progression of otosclerosis during pregnancy. I have never dreamed of a big family, but one kid would have been nice. If you have otosclerosis and have become pregnant after diagnosis, have you had any regrets? Especially if the condition has worsened?

Can you live a happy life with this? I feel like the disease is robbing me of everything in my future. I am feeling absolutely miserable.

Accepting hearing loss is definitely a bitter pill to swallow; but, thankfully no one has died from otosclerosis nor use of a hearing aid. Talk with your aud or maybe even a therapist to help get you through it!

As far as remediation, reconsider your hearing aid. They absolutely take time to adjust, especially when it is a single sided loss - but you will absolutely thank yourself in the future. Under no circumstance should you just ignore it. You run the risk of worsening speech understanding as your brain will have a very hard time deciphering what it hears. If you don’t use it, you lose it.

My otosclerosis was triggered by my second pregnancy. I'd already had mild hearing loss in that ear, but things got markedly worse. My third pregnancy didn't seem to make it any worse. 


I'm 25 years into dealing with the hearing loss, and almost completely deaf on that side, but my good ear has never had an issue. I don't like wearing my hearing aid because it's very uncomfortable at times and makes my ear canal itch, and I hate that my hair makes loud crunchy noises on the microphone. My tinnitus is bad enough that I often have trouble hearing over it with my good ear.


Recently my ENT told me I'm a candidate for a stapedectomy that has a 99% chance of restoring my hearing most of the way. I'm currently waiting for insurance approval. I may never get rid of the tinnitus, but I'm willing to take the surgery risk to try making things better. If I'm one of the 1% who lose all hearing from the ear after surgery, I'll get a cochlear implant, because my hearing situation really can't get much worse.

I have been diagnosed since I was 11 years old (surgery at 13). Around 23 I noticed it was getting bad again. I have used hearing aides starting at 30 and off and on for years. I’ll be 39 this year. I have had 4 children over the past 19 years.
    Hearing aides were not for me, I have gotten so use to not hearing the worlds every sound that when I was wearing them everything just felt to loud. I will wear my airpod pros when needed for important things (you can set them up like aides). But other then that I come to accept it and I expect others to accept it as well. I always use subtitles on the tv, I work fast food I have a hard of hearing pin on my hat, I will start a phone call or a conversation with telling them I am hard of hearing and telling them my needs.
     I feel like I live a happy life I have come to terms with it. I find now am more advocating of my needs . You got This.",2025-04-20 12:06:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k3l3c9/pregnancy_and_otosclerosis/

If you are using headphones for prolonged periods and the volume is over 70db, you will be irreversibly damaging your hearing.

Different situation here but I went to an audiologist and ENT (in the same practice), have moderate to severe hearing loss.  Suggested hearing aids which I'll be getting at a 3rd place that partners with them.

My hearing will fade, come back in, and I’ll have extremely loud ringing for about 2 minutes. Each year both my ears degraded by a couple points but it’s not enough to warrant hearing aids. I asked my ENT if there’s anything I can do and his answer was basically no, and to try and turn off any background noise at work. 

I work as an EMT, so that’s not an option for obvious reasons and he didn’t really have any other suggestions. Does anyone have any suggestions for helping my hearing in any way?

I’m surprised they didn’t recommend you try over the counter aids to see if they may help. Perhaps this would be your best bet to hold you over in the interim. Continue to get your hearing checked regularly, and if you teach a point where prescriptive aids are warranted, then you go down that route as needed.

1k160bx,HearingLoss,Sudden hearing loss hit me yesterday.  Go to the doctor immediately if you feel the same,"Another sshl patient.
Woke up yesterday, showered and noticed hearing loss in right ear. Did all the standard ear wax stuff multiple times throughout the day. I used to wash my son's ears often during his first 10 years with drainage issues. By this morning, almost 100% hearing gone in my right ear. Left seems ok. Had to fight to get into the doctor (no appointments available until next week) but got in around 1. FIGHT FOR YOURSELF TO GET SEEN. Once the doctor saw that my ears had no wax, his whole demeanor shifted to bad news. He knew immediately what it was, I didn't. Never heard of it. Started me on Prednisone and a hearing test on Monday. Great hearing with minor tinnitus from genes and playing in a band the last few years. COVID multiple times but only took the first round of required vaccine shots. Not blaming COVID, just providing more info. I can hardly function, work, be with my family and definitely can't listen to any music. Subtitles will have suffice for a while. My thoughts with anyone who has gone thru this hell before and after me. Go to the ER if you have ear issues... Immediately.

I wish you the best. Mine too was suspected to be due to covid, it's crazy important to get vaccinated really.

Mine was also suspected from covid, I had multiple rounds of the vaccine. Ask about intratympanic steroid injections as well from an ent. Good luck!

I have been suffering with complete deafness off and on since September of last year .. I have MD but the specialist’s don’t believe thats what is causing my deafness because my hearing eventually recovers without my hearing getting worse after each attack.  My attacks can last from 4 days up to 2 months and then I can go weeks without any issues….I use caption call on my cellphone and close caption on the TV when an attack hits.  

Two weeks ago I saw a genetics doctor who is doing a genetic panel on me which will take 60-90 days to come back and Im hoping this gives me some answer’s.",2025-04-17 06:16:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k160bx/sudden_hearing_loss_hit_me_yesterday_go_to_the/
1k0lxw8,HearingLoss,Anyone else here with a Persistent Stapedial Artery finding?,"The persistent stapedial artery is very rare finding, this artery develops during the first 3 months of gestation in the womb, to provide blood flow to the brain, and usually dissolves after the third month, but in very rare cases is doesn't dissolve, instead it stays in place. 

In my case this artery was discovered while having an stapedectomy surgery for Otosclerosis on my right ear, so my (very well known and respected ENT in nyc) surgeon had to close up and wasn't able to proceed with the stapedectomy, he said the risk of laceration to the artery was high and could damage the face and ear nerves, so I was back to square one but with a healing process ahead, I was super depressed and it took me a while to recover from it both physically and emotionally. I lost my right ear hearing after a pregnancy 7 years ago, so I guess I'm still newish at this...

After a couple of years I decided to visit another ENT, and we decided to go with a Oticon Ponto BAHA, which really works, I mean I can hear when I have it on, so I almost feel bad about still grieving about my hearing loss... every time I accidentally drop the hearing aid I get so afraid that it might break (they're expensive!!) and I 100% depend on it, thins might not make sense but when I can't hear I feel very irritated and can't function well.

Besides ranting a bit, my big question is... Is there anyone else here with this F\*\*\*n artery, and was it surgically removed or how is it being managed?? It is so rare that I'm having a difficult time finding real patients experiences online.

1k0bvj2,HearingLoss,Slight congestion before flight turned into miserable liquid sound and massive pain in left ear,"I hope I have found a good home for this issue. I apologize upfront for such a long winded story but I think details matter and I hope that posting this someone will have been in or is currently dealing with something similar and without a doubt support is so very much needed as answers are hard to find. I greatly appreciate anyone willing to read this entire post. If this is the wrong place to post such a thing please let me know and if anyone has a better spot for this post also let me know!

Lets start this off by saying about two years ago (2023) I managed to catch covid and didn't know I had it when this episode happened. I was sitting at my desk at work and had to sneeze but with all the panic everyone was facing I didn't want to make a scene so I help my breath and held in this sneeze. DO NOT EVER DO THIS! what a knuckle..  This caused my left ear to get a mucus snotty sound going into my inner ear like a squelchy squishy sound and quite a lot of pain. It was quite painful for weeks and I lost a lot of hearing ability but I managed to see a doctor and all was signed off as being ok and told things would take time to settle down. It took a few months to gain back full hearing but it seemed every week this got better and better so I thought no harm no foul.

In February 2025 I took off for a long flight that quickly turned to a giant hearing mess. I had some very mild congestion this particular morning and didn't think anything of it. I Hopped on a jet and took off. As we were climbing I quickly noticed my left ear was not equalizing as well as my right. Within minutes of this flight and me countless times plugging my nose and blowing to put pressure to my ears to equalize I rapidly realized nothing was working and was met with a squelchy mucus sound going into my left ear (like the same as mentioned above) with almost an immediate pop sound and the most excruciating pain in my inner ear I have ever had. When we landed I had a 3 hour layover before another flight. I noticed I was very dizzy, couldn't hear in this ear so I bought decongestants/aspirin thinking this might help. It didn't. I had to make the next flight so I knew things could get worse and of course they did. Off we go and its round two just a bit worse than the first. Tears are pouring from me as my world has now been turned upside down. I landed at my destination in a location that doesn't have doctors like the states so I went to a local ""health center"" and they looked in my ears. My right ear she said looked irritated but when she went to my left she said ""oh my it is very red deep within"" not sure if she was indicating blood but that was the take I got. She gave me psudephrine and said to take these for the rest of my trip (one week). No help.

I was at a training for scuba diving and needed to do this so I ended up doing it about four days later. While scuba diving it didn't seem to bother me as much and while descending I was able to equalize enough that it didn't bother me more than it had been. I know, not the best idea but what's done is done and no criticism needed.

To keep this as short as possible; I came back from this trip and two or so weeks later the pain settled just enough to not be as intense but I couldn't hear worth a darn in the left ear and now had ringing, dizzy spells galore, sharp head pain on my left side from the left jaw straight up over my left ear and partially wrapping over my head,  watermelon head as I coined it where when I would tap on my left side of my head it sound like the thunk sound you hear when you thump a ripe watermelon,  and a feeling of liquid with occasional movement of sticky glue like liquid in my inner ear depending on position of my head. I went to urgent care in the states and they said my right ear looked great but the left ear was slightly ""red"",  on the inside not the external ear canal. They said it didn't look like an infection and didn't see liquid but they would treat it as one. They gave me amoxicillin and it didn't change anything. I eventually was able to get into an ENT who said he cant see anything from the outside. I had a CT scan done (no contrast) and it came back with a bunch of anomalies. Oddly enough I took myself of a blood pressure medication for ( some other health reasons) that I had been taking since December of 2024 that I found out my body was reacting to it like a poison and I hadn't realized as I had been taking it at night time so I didn't grasp that a bunch of symptoms I had were caused by this 20mg Olmesartian medication. This is a whole different story but did play into my ear issues as when I went back to go over the CT scan pre surgery, I told the ENT some of my symptoms went away after a short time of stopping this medication (mainly brain fog and a major disconnect from the world around me as well as some swelling), and he noticed on visual inspection many of the issues on the scan were no longer present. The only thing we ended up doing was Turbinate reduction surgery as he thought this might help my ear/head issue. It did not. But boy can I breath better now. Here I am now 3 months later and things have gotten very slightly better but I am still not myself. 

I still have ringing in my ear, and if i plug my left ear and its super quiet it sounds like natural gas going through a pipe outside your home with a slight warble to it just with a lower frequency. Not sure how else to explain this odd auditory issue. I keep randomly getting shooting pain that streaks through my left ear up into my head. My left ear almost always feels ""full"" like mucus is wrapped around everything in there. I'm constantly having dizzy spells and a feeling of being disconnected from reality like my brain is not interpreting sound correctly and it just makes everything hard to concentrate or focus on and understand fully. This in turn has caused a great deal of depression and feeling like I'm not actually alive. 

So here I am with a list of issues and hoping that someone might have a sneak peak of an idea as the doctors at this point only act like I'm nuts and just want to stuff me full of different medications. 

Quick list of the issues I am currently facing;

1) Tinnitus , deep tone fluctuating warbling sound when I close off my left ear

2) Random shooting pain from inside my left ear

3) Constant discomfort / pressure pain that goes from my left jaw up into left ear and crests a little over my head. 

4) Infrequent but still happening watermelon head sound if I tap on my left side of my head just above my left ear.

5) 24-7 discomfort pressure on my left side of my jaw into my inner ear and up over my left side of the head inline with my ear a few inches. 

6) I purchased a digital otoscope and recorded my ear drum response when I pinch my nose and create pressure both positive and negative and the response is extremely slow compared to my right ear.

7) Slight dizzy disconnected feeling where it takes a minute to focus and comprehend what I'm looking at.

8) Constant popping/clicky sticky sound when I swallow , this happens in both ears.

9) Depending on orientation of my head, I will randomly get a drastic pop/thunk and sticky fluid type sound in my left inner ear.

10) I went and had acupuncture done and while laying face down on the table after 20 minutes and getting back up I was almost completely deaf in the left ear for about 10 minutes where hearing then slowly started coming back.

11) I hear a slight reverberation of my own voice when I speak only in this left ear.

  
Sigh.. I'm sure there is more I can add but I think I've given the most basic issues. I hope someone out there might have had something similar happen and could give some hope or insight into this bizarre issue or offer questions that might create a direction to go. I appreciate you for taking the time to read this ridiculously long message.

would say it's more of a middle ear issue. I would try tests with bone conduction headphones and really see if you can find a doctor who can seriously check whether you have problems with the Eustachian tube. Many people report dysacusis, hyperacusis, and tinnitus, but when they do the test with bone conduction headphones, they hear well, which tends to indicate that the problem is more in the middle ear, according to what I've read. I would also check the blood flow to the ear; there are studies for that. You could have some thrombosis or circulatory problems causing temporary hearing loss. I would recommend looking into that urgently, especially since it could cause more serious long-term issues. Lack of blood flow to the ear can cause permanent damage, though I don't think it's your case—maybe some mild damage. But if you can hear relatively well, it's better to prevent it",2025-04-16 04:23:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k0bvj2/slight_congestion_before_flight_turned_into/
1k03xbn,HearingLoss,loss of hearing and clarity in the right ear,"Hi, I’m Serge. It’s almost been a year since all my hearing problems began.  
I’ll keep it short so as not to bore you.

**May 2024:** a very loud door slam occurred after a family argument. I experienced a slight tinnitus in my left ear and briefly in the right, but the latter disappeared.

**June to August 2024:** I started treatment for acid reflux with 40 mg of omeprazole per day, sometimes up to 60 mg. I had no noticeable symptoms. During this time, I had earwax removed via ear irrigation. No symptoms during these months—on the contrary, I listened to a lot of loud and clear music without issues.

**September 2024:** I finished the omeprazole treatment and followed a diet. Then I developed a new symptom: pulsatile tinnitus in both ears, TMJ inflammation, and increasing discomfort from a wisdom tooth.

The first two weeks of September were calm, with little change. I kept listening to music at low volume.  
Another condition I have is auditory fatigue—when the volume exceeds 70 dB, the tinnitus in my left ear becomes very loud. That’s why I usually don’t play above 50 dB, 60 at most.

In mid-September, I began to experience a loud ringing in both ears when trying to sleep. At one point, I briefly lost hearing in both ears, but it returned without issue. A similar episode had happened before.

I continued with my usual activities: listening to music, gaming, and working. Toward the end of September, I noticed that plastic bags sounded oddly loud. The symptom disappeared, returned, but then didn’t sound strange anymore.

The day came to remove my wisdom tooth—it was a complicated extraction, deeply embedded in bone—but they managed in 30 minutes. With that resolved, I was left with a strange distortion, likely due to TMJ inflammation.

**October:** I was recovering. The wound from the extraction healed, and music still sounded great despite the pulsatile tinnitus and dysacusis.

**November:** Dysacusis worsened, but there was no measurable hearing loss. I still used music to distract myself. On November 15, my headphones broke—one side stopped working. I did tests but everything sounded off. I tried other headphones and had the same issue. That’s when I began noticing reduced audio quality in my dominant ear, the right one. The left had always sounded flatter, maybe due to two prior ear infections.

**December and January:** No major changes. I started exercising, and dysacusis improved. Hyperacusis was nearly gone. Music sounded okay, but not as crisp. I got an audiometry test—results were perfect, only a 10 dB dip at 8000 Hz. I also did homemade tests and could hear up to 15,000 Hz in each ear.

**March 2025:** During the first week, dysacusis disappeared for about 10 days. I played games and caught up on things I had postponed. On March 12, the distortion returned, but everything still felt normal, like in December. I thought maybe I could get my life back.

**March 23:** Things were stable. I tested my hearing: my left ear has a loss of 8–12 dB compared to the right between 100 Hz and 10,000 Hz. From 10,000 to 15,000 Hz, the difference could be 14–20 dB.

**April:** Between the end of March and early April, my right ear started sounding strange, like a broken radio. I also began perceiving sounds at a lower volume. Currently, I have a 12–15 dB loss in the right ear. I hear fewer details; voices sound robotic, and music feels flat, with noticeable loss of nuance and richness.

I experienced hearing loss over three weeks. I went to the ER: they said it was a wax blockage plus an infection. The infection cleared with antibiotics, and the wax was removed with irrigation. My right ear hearing improved by about 5 dB but still sounds distorted and lower in volume compared to the left (which already had some loss).

Since November, I’d been noticing reduced clarity in my right ear, but now it’s gotten worse—everything sounds flat and empty, in addition to the hearing loss. That’s all for now. 

of sharpness and clarity has been something evident in both ears but especially the right, how did I go from having a hearing that was always much more outstanding than my left ear and it was the healthy one, and I just lost that, I don't know maybe mine is degenerative and I had aunts who lost their hearing already entering their 40s maybe it's genetic I don't know, I will go to the ENT in 2 weeks and I will tell him my new symptoms, there is little left to do now I eat well and I have done what was within my reach if I continue losing hearing or not God knows because I take care of myself, for now I continue listening to music but my left ear is the dominant one and the one that hears things more clearly like that That's enough for me for now.

your example of irritation from a rustling plastic bag is very similar to my situation. If I'm not mistaken, you should have approximately the same feelings from the sound of water pouring from a shower head?",2025-04-15 21:41:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1k03xbn/loss_of_hearing_and_clarity_in_the_right_ear/
1jzg0l5,HearingLoss,Spent 3 years being told 'it was just stress' finally able to afford a different doctor after moving to a bigger city (5 years after issues began).,"Hey everyone, I 19F have been having intermittent hearing issues and I have had a difficult time advocating for myself when I go to the doctor. I have a doctors appointment on the 25th at a new clinic (onboarding apt, visiting about a work related injury, and hearing loss). I'm wondering how to approach discussing my issues without being turned away or ignored. 

Here's my issue: I have been having periods of 5 mins-15 mins where my hearing in my right ear would fade out into ringing almost on a daily basis. These periods have evolved into my hearing just fading out without any ringing and now last an average of 10-45 minutes at a time on a daily basis, sometimes more frequently. It started happening about 5 years ago, and for 3 years straight my Family practitioner would tell me 'It's just stress, when you have episodes just take a step back, take a breath and carry on'. So I just gave up talking about it. 

When I moved out, I stupidly refused to go to a doctor until I suffered a back injury that has been re-aggravated to debilitating point. Now that I've made the move to go to the doctor and get everything dealt with, I am starting to worry that my hearing with get overlooked and that it'll continue to get worse. How do I advocate for myself when I have so much going on, and do you guys have any general advice for me?

Thank you in advance!

Go in with the attitude of this being a starting point in your journey. You won’t get everything solved in one appointment and will likely need specialized doctors. Ears and backs are highly delicate and complex systems so they each deserve their own doctor and appointment.

I have had this clogged left ear for almost a year. I have been to a regular dr, urgent care, ENT x2 and chiropractor. No pain. No blood. When I turn my head to the left the clog clears itself. I am going to do another hearing test to check when my head is turned to the left to see if there is any hearing loss. 

Any ideas?!

What did the ENT doctor say

It could be something in the ear canal, TMJ or Stachyan tube. You could try a bone conduction headset. As for the obstruction, I would look by moving my neck while listening to music to see if there is more hearing. I would go see a TMJ specialist to check for possible inflammation that could close the ear and if the Stachyan tube is closed.

Okay I went and saw a specialist. Has nothing to do with hearing loss and everything to do with rapid weight loss. Patulous is what they called in. Eustation tube is abnormally open. So Dr said to make nose drops with distilled water and salt. Immediate relief. Hopefully it stays that way.",2025-04-15 00:45:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jzev2c/left_hearing_loss/

1jyr0yp,HearingLoss,My experience with low frequency SSNHL and tinnitus,"Hey everyone, after reading all these stories and following this community for a while, I’d (27M) like to share mine; I’m dealing with low-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus in my right ear.

After a night out in November 2024, I woke up with slight ringing in my right ear and reduced hearing, along with cold-like symptoms (sore throat and runny nose). Initially, I figured it would improve once the cold cleared, but it didn’t. I saw a few PC doctors just in case, and they suspected it was congestion from the cold or possibly a middle ear infection, so I took antibiotics. When there was still no improvement, I saw an ENT in December 2024 who diagnosed me with ETD, though looking back, I think this was a misdiagnosis. After a big spike in tinnitus following New Year’s, I saw a second ENT in January 2025, who officially diagnosed me with SSNHL and tinnitus. She prescribed 2 weeks of oral steroids and gave me 2 IT steroid injections, but neither helped. After that, she advised waiting 6 months if there’s potentially further improvement, and if not, possibly getting a hearing aid. Since then, I’ve noticed that both my hearing and tinnitus fluctuate at times, and a third ENT I saw in March 2025 suggested it could be cochlear hydrops. I tried 6 sessions of acupuncture, which coincided with some improvement, but I can’t say for sure it helped, and I’m currently undergoing HBOT.

From the initial onset, I’d say there was some improvement between November and January, but it’s hard to gauge how much since I didn’t get an audiogram at the time. I do remember being in class in December and having to turn my head because the tinnitus and what I now realize was hearing loss were so distracting. Thankfully, I don’t have to do that anymore. I wonder if I initially had hearing loss at all frequencies, but only the lower frequencies didn't recover. Since January, there were times when the tinnitus would be completely gone, and my hearing would improve, but both were inconsistent and had no clear pattern. As of today (4/14), I still have hearing loss, and the tinnitus isn’t as bothersome as it used to be, but I continue to hear a distortion that never went away, especially in noisy environments, like when there are a lot of people talking. I'm thinking about other tests, but I'm unsure of what to get.

Although I understand that what I’m going through is a mild case, it’s still been challenging; this has been the hardest time of my life so far. What makes me feel worse is how young I was when I lost my hearing; I’ve always taken care of myself by being active, eating a good diet, and taking my vitamins, and yet I still lost my hearing. This, combined with the fact that my doctors didn’t tell me that this was a medical emergency, has made it very difficult for me to accept and come to terms with. I still think of the life I had before all this started. Currently, I'm in counseling, and we’ll see how that goes, but if there’s one positive, it’s that this experience has made me a more empathetic person. If anyone has any advice or tips that helped them through something similar, I’d appreciate it, and if you have any questions, I’m happy to answer.

# Timeline

**2024**

**November**

* **11/22**: I went out with friends, walked around outside, and had a few drinks; it was colder than usual, and I had a runny nose, but nothing I haven't experienced before.
* **11/23**: I woke up the next morning with tinnitus and what felt like hearing loss (I didn't know that at the time) in my right ear, along with cold-like symptoms (sore throat and runny nose). The sound was off, and my right AirPod sounded robotic and distorted. I’d never had ear issues before, so I made an appointment with my PC doctor, not realizing how serious it might be.
* **11/26 – PC**: The doctor saw nothing abnormal in my ears and said it could be congestion from the cold. She expected the symptoms to resolve as the cold improved.

**December**

* **12/3 – PC**: No improvement; took Claritin D for a week.
* **12/11 – PC**: No improvement; the doctor saw yellow fluid in my ear, which may have been otitis media, and prescribed antibiotics.
* **12/20**: No improvement; finished the antibiotics but still had tinnitus and hearing loss, so I made an ENT appointment.
* **12/24 – ENT (1)**: The ENT diagnosed ETD and prescribed Flonase. No audiogram was done. Looking back, I wish I had asked for a second opinion sooner.

**2025**

**January**

* **1/3-4**: After a week of Flonase, my tinnitus spiked, so I booked an appointment with a different ENT, but the earliest available was 1/14, since I was driving back to school from break at the time.
* **1/14 – ENT (2)**: The ENT officially diagnosed me with SSNHL and tinnitus and ordered an MRI; my audiogram showed mild-to-moderate low-frequency loss and 80% speech recognition. I received my 1^(st) IT steroid injection and began 2 weeks of prednisone. I was a little bit in shock after this, because I went into this appointment thinking I was fine, and then I was told that I had hearing loss and they needed to inject steroids into my ear. I had to tell them to slow down and explain everything to me, and I almost broke down in tears in the room.
* **1/17 – MRI**: The results were unremarkable.
* **1/17-21**: Noticed temporary improvement (no tinnitus and better hearing sometimes); bought new AirPods Pro 2 for the hearing test feature (I know it isn’t as accurate, but I wanted to see if there were any trends).
* **1/28 – ENT (2)**: The ENT injected a 2^(nd) dose of steroids; my audiogram was worse from 1/14, but tinnitus was more noticeable during the test. I was also referred to a major university hospital for another opinion.
* **1/31 – ENT (3, NP)**: She agreed with the prior ENT and referred me for HBOT and acupuncture.

**February**

* **2/3 – ENT (3, Neurotologist)**: I was able to get this appointment thanks to a friend who works there and recommended this specific doctor. She confirmed the previous findings and had no new recommendations.
* **2/7 – Acupuncture**: Honestly, I was skeptical, but my parents were convinced that this would help (we’re Chinese), and since they offered to cover it, I agreed.
* **2/11 – ENT (2)**: The audiogram showed some improvement, though I might have pressed the button too early one time, and speech was at 100%. No further treatment was recommended, and they will reassess in 6 months or consider a hearing aid.
* **2/13 – HBOT Consult (3)**: Was ordered a chest X-ray and echocardiogram.
* **2/14, 2/21, 2/28  – Acupuncture**
* **2/14–3/1**: My tinnitus was mostly silent, and hearing improved. Some AirPods tests even showed normal results, and I started CIMT after reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonoHearing/comments/173xvfz/cimt_how_i_fully_recovered_my_hearing_over_a/mdwrplw/?context=3) post. Honestly, I didn't do it consistently, but it could have been a reason why I don't have any issues with speech.
* **2/17 – Chest X-ray &amp; Echo**: Were normal.

**March**

* **3/4 – HBOT**: I went to a different facility after insurance delays. I felt fine during the session, but tinnitus and hearing worsened 4–5 hours afterward, possibly coincidentally, so I paused treatment for a week. My hearing was at this level for a few weeks, and this did not happen to me again. The HBOT technician I saw on 3/15 thinks it was barotrauma or ETD, but I was skeptical of this. Has this happened to anyone?
* **3/7, 3/13 – Acupuncture**
* **3/15 – HBOT**: Switched to a closer facility.
* **3/18–20, 3/24–27 – HBOT**
* **3/20 – ENT (3)**: My audiogram was unchanged since 2/11; speech was 96%. ENT said there were no more treatment options and suspected possible cochlear hydrops, which really freaks me out.
* **3/26**: Noticed my hearing improving again, which coincided with the 10^(th) HBOT session; again, not sure if this is causal.

**April**

* **4/1-2, 4/4, 4/7-11, 4/14, 4/16-18, 4/21-23, 4/25 – HBOT**
* **4/5 - Acupuncture**: Glad that's over, I don't think it helped improve my hearing. It was relaxing, though.
* **4/11-13**: Got a cold again, so hearing got worse in the left ear as well; interestingly, this cold was worse than the one on 11/23.
* **4/19 - Sam's Club Hearing Test**: I wish I'd known about it before; had improvement at lower frequencies (250 Hz: 40 → 35 dBHL, 500 Hz: 40 → 30 dBHL, 750 Hz: 25 → 15 dBHL). She also did an OAE, which matched the one from before.
* **4/26 - Sam's Club Hearing Test**: My hearing was worse than last week (250 Hz: 40 dBHL, 500 Hz: 35 dBHL); this time, I also got a printout of my OAE results.
* **4/27 - HBOT**: This is my 25^(th) session. Even though I had some improvement from self-tests, my audiograms from the past 2 weeks didn't show improvement, so I don't think I will continue.

**May**

* **5/2 - Sam's Club Hearing Test**: My hearing seemed better (250 Hz: 25 dBHL, 500 Hz: 20 dBHL); I asked the guy about it, and previous exams and he said I had normal hearing, which I didn't find useful at all, but I guess he wasn't an audiologist or Dr; I also did a Apple APP2 Hearing Test, which was about 1-2 dB within my test. Hearing seems to have been about stable after this (in the 20-30 range, sometimes 500 is above 20).
* **5/19**: I had some temporary increase in tinnitus and a feeling of pressure after BJJ in the evening. It improved later that evening and was gone by the next morning. Has this happened to anyone else, and would this be evidence for cochlear hydrops?

**August**

* **8/12 - ENT (2)**: This was my appointment 9 months after I lost my hearing. My hearing test showed improvement in the lower frequencies (250 Hz: 35 → 30 dB, 500 Hz: 40 → 20 dB, 750 Hz: 20 → 15 dB) since my last audiogram with this ENT (2/11), and it was very similar to the hearing test from Sam's Club (5/2). I also did an Apple APP2 Hearing Test (250 Hz: 23 dB, 500 Hz: 15 dB), which didn't really match the audiogram earlier in the day. I'm not sure what this improvement is from; maybe it's HBOT or time? Interestingly, with my APP2 Hearing Test, I've noticed an improvement since May, and especially since July. In May and June, the highest dB for 250 and 500 Hz was 23 and 15 dB, respectively; in July was 19 and 13 dB, then in August, it was 17 and 11 dB. Does anyone else know what this could mean?

**September**

* **Since 9/14**: I started taking NAC every day, and I think it has really, really improved my tinnitus and hearing (according to my APP2 Hearing Test). My 250 Hz jumped from the mid 20s dB to 14-11 dB, and my 500 Hz was from 14-13 dB to 6-4 dB. I'm not sure if this was a coincidence or if this actually helped, but I will keep taking it. Also, good news is that distortion is pretty much gone or very unnoticeable, although listening to things through only my right ear, I can tell things are still off.

I'll try to keep this updated. Feel free to ask questions. Maybe the SSD or stem cells with come out soon.

**TLDR:** I’ve had mild-moderate low-frequency SSNHL and tinnitus since November 2024. Initially, doctors weren’t concerned, but an ENT later administered 2 IT steroid injections and prescribed 2 weeks of oral steroids, which didn't help. My hearing and tinnitus have fluctuated, which may be cochlear hydrops. Since then, I’ve tried acupuncture, started HBOT, and I’m currently in counseling. If nothing else, I've learned to protect my ears moving forward.

**If you're reading this and experiencing hearing loss or tinnitus, please see a doctor. It may not be SNHL, but it's better to be safe than sorry.**

Do you have a pressure/fullness feeling with the hearing loss ?

Hey man, I’m super sorry to hear this has happened to you. I too have low frequency SNHL that occurred suddenly. I was 21 when it first happened a few years ago. Similar to you, I thought it was a cold and the doctor I saw referred me to an ENT like a month afterwards. Steroids didn’t help and MRI was clear thankfully. 

I will say I thought it was SSNHL for about a year after the onset. The ENT told me to watch my salt for tinnitus and I did. The audiologist suggested I had cochlear hydrops and told me caffeine and salt both would make it worse so I cut caffeine completely and watched salt intake. 

After about a year from onset I got super lax with my diet and overdid the sodium and unfortunately I had another drop in my low frequencies. Doctors confirmed I had cochlear hydrops at that point. I’m currently sitting around 50-60dB loss at 250Hz sloping up to normal at around 1500Hz. It only affects my left ear.

I am super thankful that it hasn’t turned into Ménière’s disease with vertigo episodes and pray it stays that way. I’m 4 years into it and my hearing has been stable for 3 years now. Still sticking to low salt diet, no caffeine, and avoiding other Ménière’s triggers. I drink at least 4L of water a day along with taking Dyazide and a glutathione supplement. 

Hopefully you don’t have cochlear hydrops but I will say that with the way you say it fluctuates, there’s a good chance you have it. Mine fluctuates if I don’t watch what I eat and overdo sodium. I never noticed it until I really started paying attention after the drops. 

Please feel free to DM me if you have any questions or want to talk. I know how hard I grieved over the hearing I had lost and know how hard it was for me.

Hey !!! Any update now?  I have been suffering from this for 5 months too.😢

Yes happen to me too . After watching tv , I got muffled ears and a cold made it worse .

The tiny outer hair cells inside our inner ears emit sounds in response to stimuli when they are working normally. Your right ear is not emitting an otoacoustic emission (a sound coming from within the ear) in response to the stimulus, which is usually indicative of some type of hearing loss. DPOAEs tend to be absent if there is a hearing loss greater than 40 or 50dB HL. This test isn’t usually done by itself, but as part of a group of other tests. Did you also have other tests?

I took the precautions and went straight to a ENT and audiologist and they tested my hearing and there was a 5-10 decibel loss in both ears, they said that can be a variable each time in a test and the loss doesn't warrant any treatment so I left empty handed and disheartened, I'm so stressed I already had a mild hearing loss from SSNHL last year and just finally got used to the volume level of my ears now it's tons worse I'm so stressed I can't hear my child wake up in the night I struggle to follow conversations and I have to have my TV up louder, why is it affecting me so bad? What's the deal I'm so depressed 
I'll attach the picture of my audiogram (I know it may not look bad compared to some people with hearing loss) but that's why it's baffled me so much that it feels so much quieter and worse, my previous audiograms had 5-10 decibels better in some sections 
Please any advice or help 😞

i dont mean to be rude, but there is no hearing loss on this audiogram. at 6k on one ear there is the slightest dip into slight hearing loss but honestly shouldn’t really be noticeable

Edit and moved because I didn’t want to hijack a comment thread 

Thinking some of your outer hair cells might be damaged. My audiogram charts look mild to moderate but most of my hearing loss is due from absent function of the hair cells. I also have tinnitus in both ears with high frequency consonants dropping out in low conversation or a noisy environment 

Ask if they can do a DPOAE test. It’ll tell you if it’s inner ear rather than conductive",2025-04-12 11:38:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jxfbsf/tv_sound_calibration_damaged_my_hearing/
1jx9v1m,HearingLoss,Any ideas what could have caused hearing loss? Any others with similar experience? What to expect?,"Hey all. Posting from a burner just to protect my ID. I was more or less looking to get thoughts and experiences from others, especially if they've gone through something similar. I'm 37m, got the flu early February and despite being vaccinated, it hit me like a truck. Nobody else in my family got it, or at least they didn't exhibit symptoms. I was bedridden for a week or so, massive congestion. Now, I've had sinus issues my entire life but the infections have always remained in my sinuses and have never involved my ears, or at least hasn't cause infection/fluid in them. Not so this time. Much more ear pain and pressure. During the flu, a low level of tinnitus started in one ear. It wasn't a big deal and was easily drowned out by even fairly quiet sounds. I had to really concentrate to notice it. 


---


Meanwhile, the sinus infection didn't clear. Fast forward 9 weeks, 3 rounds of different antibiotics/steroids still haven't cleared the infection. Every visit/message I mention that the ear pain/pressure is what's really bothering me. Last appt before my primary referred me to an ENT I mentioned how the tinnitus had now grown louder, to the point I hear it over conversation, loud music, etc. It's a steady high pitch whine. Ear pain, pressure, sinus pain, etc all had gotten worse or at best hadn't shown improvement, which I mention to the ENT. First ENT scopes me, says maybe some infection in ephmoid sinus but otherwise nothing. Extends the 3rd antibiotic (that wasn't working) another 10 days and schedules audiological evaluation and CT of sinuses. Audiological report I guess shows hearing loss? During the follow up a different PA was just like ""looks like you've lost some hearing"" but literally didn't go beyond that or address whether it might be permanent, etc. Meanwhile, after the AR but before the CT, another tone of tinnitus joins the first, just a couple octaves lower. CT comes back unremarkable other than sinus infection in maxillary sinus. ENT says nothing urgent, see you in a month. Given the relatively rapid changes, it certainly seemed urgent to me. 


---
So I went to a second ENT. He went over the case and AR, and said he thinks it might be otosclerosis. He also scopes my sinuses, switches me to a more powerful antibiotic and prednisone and orders a CT of my temporal bone to confirm. Couple days later, more new tinnitus, this time lower pitched pulsating rather than high pitched steady whine. Then, a couple days ago, my young children were yelling and screaming while they played and it triggered something in my right ear that at best I can say is pulsatile tinnitus. So now, for the past three weeks I've had increasing tinnitus, increasing episodic vertigo and dizziness, and the general feeling of being off-balance. The CT scan of temporal bone comes back today and again shows nothing remarkable other than a mucosal retention cyst in my maxillary sinus. So no otosclerosis. 


---


Sorry, I know this is a long read but wanted to provide as much detail as I could. I've been reading so much on what could be causing this and whether the hearing loss/tinnitus will continue to worsen, whether this is permanent, possible treatments, other's experiences, etc. My thought is the flu virus caused damage to some nerve cells/hair cells in the cochlea and this is now permanent, in which case I have to wonder if there's any treatment for the hearing loss/tinnitus. Part of me had hoped the CT would confirm what the ENT doc thought cause then I would at least have an answer. Unfortunately, the ENT is out until my next appt on the 24th. So I'm stuck in limbo as the pain/pressure in my face/ears have returned and slowly gotten worse since finishing the prednisone and wondering why my hearing is going at, what seems like, a rapid pace. Guess I'm just really looking for thoughts, experiences of others, how things turned out for you if you went through something similar, etc.

Some conductive hearing loss can be corrected.  However, you need enough of a deficit for surgery to be worth it.  I've had alot of surgery and scar tissue is a problem.

It looks like a mixed hearing loss.  It's both sensineural and conductive.   What did your ENT say?

Have you asked them about viral labrynthitis and sudden hearing loss?

Have you been back since developing pulsing tinnitus? is it like your heart beat in your ear or more of a wooshing sound? 

i lost my hearing to covid (had all of the issues you described w sinuses). i grew up apparently with lupus and could never clear sinus infections so it would go to my ears and eyes and cause issues 

has all of the infection cleared? if not, it could simply be that! the inner ear is very sensitive",2025-04-12 05:12:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jx9v1m/any_ideas_what_could_have_caused_hearing_loss_any/

maybe a stupid question but does everyone experience this or is it a potential sign of hearing loss? I also have lifelong tinnitus that's worsening in recent years, which is why I'm kinda on alert for any sign of that

I got a hearing test after I started noticing I had trouble hearing people. People would say they were calling me and I had no idea. Also, i have a couple mumblers in my family I realized I struggled hearing when I moved back closer to home. 

So I get an audio test. Turns out I have cookie bite hearing loss - a drop in the mid frequencies that are in the speech range. It’s an unusual hearing loss - only 1% of people with hearing loss have it - but unlike age related hearing loss which happens later in life, cookie bite hearing loss you’re born with it. When I reflect back in my life, I realize this is true for me too. 

Now that I use hearing aids, I don’t struggle understanding people, and I hear music more clearer. As a musician, singing and playing is also so much easier and enjoyable now.",2025-04-11 23:39:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jx3y50/trouble_with_hearing_the_second_vowel_formant/

I also play guitar, often loud.

I got this hearing report and they recommended Signia hearing aids. They come in expensive, expensive-er, and really freaking expensive. They told me I could go somewhere else and get private label ones signia makes and other cheaper knockoffs, but they are not as tweakable or whatever.

I decided to get the middle ones which cost $4K. I’m going to get them in a couple weeks. My logic was: they are small, I can afford it, if I’m going to go through the annoyance of wearing these things they better be good, and tweakable seems important for the future.

But now i got the report and it doesn’t look that bad. I’m no expert but from googling it looks like the PTA and SRT are normal and I heard all the words and had zero trouble with background noise. So I am second guessing. I can tell i have some hearing loss but is it $4K bad?

Also they said the Signia could help with the tinnitus but i thought you couldn’t do anything about tinnitus.

Thanks in advance

You got 100% word recognition BECAUSE they made the words LOUD enough for you to hear well. This is an indicator of how well hearing aids will work for you. 

65DB ""HL"" presentation level is approx 75DB ""SPL"".
 
If they tested word recognition at a very low volume, you would get a lower score. But you wouldn't know how well you would hear when sounds are loud enough to hear well.

Not everyone can understand the words, even when presented at the optimal volume.

What about listening to tv, in background noise? Are you able to do that? Can you hear birds or soft sounds?

I mean hearing better can mask tinnitus more. Some even have build in masking and such, but it is not curing it. You might just notice it less

The PTA is the average value of 500 hz, 1000hz and 2000hz.(See the label) It doesn't include the higher frequencies you can't hear as well

Word recognition: the volume has to be 65 db for you to hear accurately. I think the norm is 20 db? 

Keep in mind that you were tested in a controlled environment, a soundproof box. Outside noise does interfere with clarity. 

Your hearing aids should be programmed in a slope like your test. You should also have a trial period. 

Ask if the aids have an “acclimation” feature. This should help avoid headaches from the sudden loudness of your surroundings.",2025-04-11 20:53:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jx0can/understanding_hearing_test/
1jwrm57,HearingLoss,Conference participation,"Would love to know how people handle this type of situation. I am at a conference and was in a presentation that was just excellent. However, we got to a part where they chose to break into groups to discuss an issue. So we have 20-30 groups of 3 people all talking at once, in a relatively small room. 

I stepped out because there is just no way I can participate at all in that. Even with my hearing aides I just can’t isolate the 2 people I’m speaking with.  

[댓글]
Tell the organisers so that they can take this into account for future conferences. People can’t make things accessible if they don’t know about issues like this. They could for example accommodate you by providing a private breakout area where you could be with a small group, or book a conference venue with sound absorbing panelling. I promise you deserve to be included!

I go through the same thing. I haven’t really found an alternative to just needing to step out. Sometimes it’s rough.

I was a sort of professional conference speaker and workshop facilitator for many years, so I have attended hundreds of events, and am friendly with many conference organizers.

I genuinely think organizers are more sensitive to accessibility and other requests from attendees. When I started speaking 15 years ago, ASL interpreters or CART captioning was unheard of. Today CART is almost a given at most large events.

So absolutely ask for what you need, and give feedback to the organizers. For example, I would expect that whoever was facilitating this small group thing could encourage folks who need a quieter space to go out in the hallway or into a separate breakout room. Honestly it's bad event design to have that much cross-talk in a small room.

One thing I've learned is there are a LOT of people who have trouble hearing, even if they don't wear hearing aids or consider themselves disabled. People really appreciate the CART captions and welcome a quieter space. Same deal with food sensitivities, once it became normalized to offer a range of gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan options, people appreciate the care given to the attendee experience and feel more comfortable asking for what they need.

I use a speech to text app, OpenAI (same company that does Zoom captions), that *sometimes* works in these situations.

I also tell the group off the bat that I have severe hearing loss, please look at me and project even if we're the loudest in the room, and I'll be staring at  your face for speechreading.

But yeah, sometimes I just sit through it or leave.",2025-04-11 14:45:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jwrm57/conference_participation/

Doc here. BERA is normal = It's not ANSD. 

If you're really hearing distorted and this is not a neurological/psychiatric issue then it means Your issue is a complex one, you will not find an answer on reddit. Work with a good ENT, a university professor or something if possible.

have you considered psychological symptoms? your hearing level is perfect and tinnitus may be annoying but its very mild (if it was severe, it would hurt your audiogram). look into processing disorders and even nonorganic hearing loss. 

have you seen an ENT? the crackling makes me think it could be eustachian tube related

Or ansd

B12 shots helped my full muffled feeling

Cochlear synopathy ? But I don't think so the bera test is normal. There's still so much about hearing we don't understand.

1jvga6t,HearingLoss,Should I get Hearing Aids?,"For context I’m 22 female

I got a hearing test yesterday, and my results are definitely not showing bad hearing loss, but I really struggle with conversations, watching tv, in lectures at uni, etc. 

I struggle a lot when I can’t see people’s faces when talking, and I feel like I am constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves.
I also struggle a lot when I don’t have captions/subtitles like in university lectures which means I often just stay home and watch recorded versions so I can skip back and use auto generated subtitles.

I’m conflicted on as to whether I should pursue further testing and possibly hearing aids as my results really aren’t that bad, and I am unsure how much of a difference it would make, and the cost is just so high :/

any and all advice would be appreciated:)

[댓글]
you could always look into processing disorders if you feel you struggle to understand! a small amount of struggle with background noise is typical for mild loss but hearing aids dont always help

Hearing protection is what I would advise!

I have similar levels of hearing loss and have had a hearing aid for the last few months (luckily for free. I have only one hearing aid despite loss in both ears, due to another medical reason). I do find it makes a difference to how hard I have to work to keep up, which is tiring, and to how frustrating it is to only hear 90% of a sentence and ask someone to repeat and they repeat the whole thing and not just the missing bit you need etc. Every time I put the hearing aid in I'm amazed how loud the birds sound etc. I do wonder if I had two heating aids if the effect would be even better. 

How expensive are a basic pair of hearing aids for you? It's tough if it's a lot of money.

I'm also a lifelong glasses wearer and very grateful that from childhood my parents encouraged me to pick out the frames I wanted, paid for fancy lenses etc because they made it clear that my health and happiness is important. Hearing aids are no different in my opinion- you being able to hear properly and enjoy life without struggle is a top priority. If you can find a way to afford even a basic pair then do, you are worth it x

[removed]

You could but they're unlikely to be that helpful - hearing aids amplify everything, you can program them to help more with certain frequencies etc but not to pick out speech over background noise. And since you're only just below the normal range they probably wouldn't even give you much amplification. Have you tried other assistive tech? I use LiveTranscribe for captioning in real time if I'm in a class, large group conversation etc and it's super helpful. A lot of it's just self awareness as well - are you being proactive about standing where you can see someone's face while talking to them etc?

what did AuD say? they are more informed to help you. As far as i know you wouldnt be a candidate for hearing aids

I wouldn’t with those levels

No

[removed]

I have the same situation as yours, the doctor told me to get hearing aid since my situation is severe. He said that I got it genetically so there is no other solution than having hearing aids. And worse of that, if I don't get hearing aid now, when I go older it can cause me dementia. I hope we can find other solutions instead of using hearing aids.",2025-04-09 20:44:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jvga6t/should_i_get_hearing_aids/
1jvb6k8,HearingLoss,Wondering if I should be doing more,"Update at the end: 

In 2016 I lost a lot my hearing in my right ear. In 2023 I learned to what extent. I’ve lost 85db and cannot recognize words no matter how loud they are. At the time my left ear was doing well so I adapted to only relying on the left. 

Wednesday I woke up with weird distortion on the left side and left a voicemail with my ENT. It went away the same day so I sadly moved on. 

Thursday I woke up again this time with the distortion more prevalent. I called my ent 4 times that day but didn’t ever get an answer. 

Friday I woke up without any hearing on the left. I was terrified. I have poor eyesight already that’s deteriorating rather fast. My husband called the ent when they opened and they said they couldn’t see me until Tuesday. We ended up going to urgent care where I was lead to believe I had a minor infection and fluid built up in my middle ear. That made sense with my symptoms so I used the steroid nasal spray and took the antibiotic. 

Yesterday I was informed there was nothing in my middle ear and no infection in sight but I still could barely hear. I’ve been using the live captions on my phone with my limited hearing to even have these chats. MRI scheduled for a month out. 

I saw the audiologist for an audiogram yesterday where I learned that I’ve lost a lot of the hearing at lower frequencies. I explained the weirdly robotic distortion when I hear speech and how If there is any other noice I cannot figure out what people are saying. She seemed concerned and told me to go back to my ent and see if they could move up the mri. They wouldn’t even see me. Told me to just wait and that is the earliest they could possibly do. 

When my ent saw my results she said she was urgently referring me to an ear specialist an hour away. They scheduled me for June. 

I keep being told urgent and time sensitive but I’m also just waiting around. I feel like I should be doing more so I don’t lose the rest of my hearing but if the drs are saying this is okay to wait that long maybe I’m wrong? I’ve never been one to stand up for myself and so I’m wondering if this is a case where I need to be more active. 

Sorry it was so long. Just really wanted to explain the situation cause I’m at a loss 

Update 4/10
I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded and gave me advice. I took it and made sure to be my own advocate 

I contacted my ent regarding getting a referral somewhere else and was told she was out until Monday when I asked if the other doctor could do it, I was met with clear annoyance and basically told she could ask him but didn’t know. I took this as my sign to take it into my own hands

I called around and found a location 2 hours away that had a cancellation in just over 2 hours. My husband got permission to leave work and we rushed over. That Doctor was AMAZING. I couldn’t say enough nice things. 

He agreed that 2 months was far too late to do the Intratympanic steroid injection. He explained I would be scheduled for two additional injections each a week apart and upped my oral steroids (previously 3 20mg tablets for 3 days, and then decreasing every three days until I started on a separate course of 5mg tablets and was slowly taken off) so that I take the 20mg tablets for 14 straight days (11 more days) and then come off of them at a different rate. He asked to see my MRI results once I got them as well. 

I actually feel like I was heard and my situation was treated with urgency. The only other person who had treated it as such was the audiologist who even made time to see me the day my ent put in the referral. 

I’ve never had to advocate for myself like this. Or maybe I’ve needed to and didn’t realize. So thank you guys for making me feel like I wasn’t being crazy or overreacting. Something is being done now. And maybe it won’t work, but at least I’m doing everything I can.

Otolaryngology is a small world(they all know each other). June is not an URGENT referral but standard time. Leave a message for your regular ENT again letting her know the appointments not till June she’ll reach out to the other ENT.

I would call the ear specialist's office and ask if there have been any cancelations, and let them know that you have an urgent situation. You can do this several times per week until they see you. I've had several medical and dental appointments moved up this way. It works, especially if you can get the office staff on your side.


You can do the same thing for the MRI by calling the imaging facility (assuming it's separate from your regular ENT's office?). People cancel or move their imaging appointments all the time. Or, if the MRI is scheduled at your regular ENT's facility, then you can ask for a referral to schedule one somewhere else.


Bottom line, I would communicate directly with the places where you are trying to move your appointments up, rather than going through your regular ENT. They are not helping you.


(Disclaimer: I can't speak to the urgency of your particular situation or symptoms. I'm just assuming that your audiologist and the other commenters may be right in saying it's urgent)

Depending on your country, your ENT may be legally obligated to hold office hours for acute/urgent/ emergency cases. If this is the case where you live, simply go there and explain your situation. Prescribing a quick course of Cortisone takes a few minutes, but may end up making a huge difference for you.

You are definitely correct, after 2 weeks, there is nothing they can do generally. Do your best to advocate for yourself as this is an EMERGENCY if you want to try to keep your hearing

1jv5d8l,HearingLoss,Accoustic Trauma. Crazy Anxiety,"Hello everyone. After attending a concert, I was afraid my ears might hurt because I was aware that I had a problem when listening to something at a very high volume (which is normal for everyone). At the beginning of the concert, I was at the front and went near the speakers... I know I did wrong, but I started feeling unwell and experiencing pain in both ears, as if it were a strange kind of deafness, something very common among people who attend concerts.

I have never had tinnitus or the need to use earplugs. It’s strange, but I’ve never needed them. I have never been to concerts, festivals, etc. I don’t even go to the cinema, and I’ve never had problems, except when something is extremely loud, which makes my ears hurt, or the occasional ear infection as a child. I would say that's normal for everyone. I even travelled to India and stayed in a house where air planes passed overhead every 30 minutes, and I was able to sleep.

After the concert (48 hours ago), I went to the emergency room because my ears hurt quite a bit. I was able to hear absolutely everything without any major problem but with extreme sensitivity... It was something I had never experienced before, and it’s driving me crazy, absolutely crazy. It’s inexplicable, but the doctor told me that my eardrums were perfect and that my ears had a fungal infection, a fungal otitis that was present in both ears... to my surprise.

I’ve been using the drops prescribed to eliminate the fungus, and I’ve currently improved ""somewhat."" However, I still have that sensitivity to noises, which has caused an anxiety disorder. In the first hours after the concert, whenever I heard something loud, it drove me crazy because it made my ears hurt even more and triggered this disorder. Additionally, I’ve had a sensation of clogged ears, all very strange, making it impossible to lead a normal life.

I have been experiencing anxiety for quite some time before the concert, with eye twitches and general discomfort. What’s curious about all of this is that I feel fine in quiet environments. Even though my ears hurt (not as much, but I do feel some pressure), I don’t have ringing or strange vibrations caused by silence. I can even wear headphones without any problem (I’ve only done it once since the symptoms began, and I didn’t experience pain or anything similar, although I have to keep the volume low). I’m practising meditation and will try to see an ENT specialist as soon as possible.

[댓글]
Nearly every job will have that. It's just what's usually in a job description.

I answer honestly that I have effective communication skills - I'm very good at understanding body language/non-verbal communication, write/keep records well and frequently get told I come across empathetic and seem like I'm really paying attention, listening to &amp; valuing the person (probably mostly because I lipread so I have to pay attention, but hey it gives a good impression), plus I can sign and pick up on other non-standard communication methods better than most hearing people. Yes I can't HEAR much but that does mean I can't COMMUNICATE, I imagine you're the same and you're totally within your rights to say you are good at communication skills (plus it's just a buzzword for a lot of jobs and not something you actually need to pay lots of attention to). Unless the job has an occupational health requirement you're not required to disclose your hearing loss and with a mild loss you can probably get away with not mentioning it, especially if you don't wear visible hearing aids or other tech

I don’t let the communications part scare me off because communication is very broad. But if it says must be able to listen in a noisy environment- it’s a no. Mind you, I work with groups of students, but I can control the noise. Places like restaurants and places with constant construction or industrial noise or airplanes would be a no go.

Now i don’t have any major problems but obviously i hate how unbalanced sound is to me when i listen to music with earphones and sometimes i get sensory issues with noises because of how it feels unbalanced to me otherwise I’m fine i can hear without my hearing aids.
Well until last year in September there was no explanation on my hearing loss but i got diagnosed with Alport Syndrome which is possibly the reason why i have hearing loss. 
If you don’t know what it is, it’s a genetic rare disorder which causes mutation in the genes causing kidney disease, hearing loss and eye abnormalities.
Now I’m fine no changes to my hearing loss so far in each yearly exam and my version of this syndrome is the least progressive one.

1juusu4,HearingLoss,Feeling Pressured Toward a Cochlear Implant for My Baby—Am I Right to Be Cautious?,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice and insight from anyone experienced with auditory neuropathy, cochlear implants, pediatric hearing loss, or even clinical research.

My 7-month-old son was diagnosed with unilateral auditory neuropathy (right ear is normal, left ear shows profound loss) via ABR at 2 months old. We’re currently being seen at UCLA, where we finally had our first consult with an ENT, Dr. Akira Ishiyama, who is the head of the UCLA cochlear implant program and also performs the surgeries himself.

At that appointment, Dr. Ishiyama suggested a sedated MRI and a repeat ABR in a couple of months to check for presence or development of the auditory nerve. Totally reasonable, and we’re on board with that. However, what really caught me off guard is how strongly the conversation was already being directed toward cochlear implants, despite the fact that we don’t even know if the nerve is present yet—or if my son would benefit from an implant at all.

He also brought in a woman named Wendy, a cochlear implant coordinator, to speak with us at that first appointment. She’s apparently also handling the scheduling for my son’s MRI and ABR, which seems odd given her title. What’s even stranger is that Wendy actually contacted me weeks before we even had our ENT consult, trying to schedule something she called a “cochlear implant fitting.” At the time, we hadn’t even spoken to a doctor about what was going on. When I declined the appointment… she tried calling my husband a week or so later. And he didn’t decline as graciously as I did, he really questioned her intentions. It felt like we were already being pushed into a surgical pipeline before we even understood the diagnosis.

Another thing that concerned me: Dr. Ishiyama mentioned the OTOF gene mutation, which I had researched extensively beforehand. I know that OTOF mutations almost always present bilaterally, but there are rare cases where it presents unilaterally. When I brought this up, he flat-out told me that OTOF mutations “never present unilaterally” and therefore he would not be ordering genetic testing. He seemed very confident and dismissive about this. But from everything I’ve read—including research papers and community forums—this statement just isn’t accurate. I understand that current clinical gene therapy trials at UCLA are only for bilateral cases, but why wouldn’t we want to know if it’s an OTOF mutation anyway, especially since this could inform future treatment options? Wouldn’t it also be good advice to get the testing to know if it was genetic in case my husband and I ever decided to have another child?

To be clear: I’m not anti-cochlear implant. I just want to fully understand my son’s specific diagnosis and options before going down a permanent surgical route. From what I’ve read, cochlear implants don’t always work well for auditory neuropathy patients, depending on the cause and nerve function. It’s also a little concerning to me that insurance covers cochlear implants but not hearing aids, and that this financial dynamic might be influencing recommendations—consciously or unconsciously.

So here are my questions:

Is it normal for cochlear implant coordinators to be involved in MRI/ABR scheduling before the ENT has even seen the patient?

Should I be pushing harder for genetic testing, even if this doctor dismissed it?

Is it reasonable to question whether my child is being rushed into a cochlear implant pathway too early?

Has anyone else experienced a similar pressure from large CI programs?

Are there other centers (or audiologists/geneticists) who take a more comprehensive or individualized approach?

Thank you in advance to anyone who reads this. I’m just trying to advocate for my son in a way that gives him the best possible chance—without skipping important diagnostic steps or getting swept up in a system that may have its own priorities.

I would suggest searching/asking on r/deaf and r/Cochlearimplants for more info, if you haven't already done so. This sub and r/audiology are pretty small.

I am just a person on the internet with moderately severe hearing loss, but there's no way I would get a CI or would get one for my baby without talking to multiple providers. Get a second or third opinion.

I think you are right to be very cautious. CI is major surgery, it destroys the residual hearing, and you have no idea what treatments might become available in the next 10-20 years that your son might benefit from.

Personally, I would opt for the least invasive approach possible, which would primarily focus on bilingual language acquisition (ASL/English) from an early age. Especially if he has full hearing in one ear, if you give him the advantage of learning sign as a baby, I think he would do very well. Again, I am just an internet person so don't take my advice as anything more than well-intentioned.

You are definitely in the right.

Doctors pushing hard for surgery without the diagnosis even being certain while also being dismissive about questions is always a red, red red flag.

Refusing a gene test  - another red flag, there is no reaon not to do a gene test. Especially because treatment for Otoferlin deficiency is actually advancing fast and may still arrive in time to save your sons hearing if it really is the case.

Very importantly, you should keep in mind that your son is only affected in one ear, which means this is not very urgent and you should not allow anyone to put pressure on you. Since he hears normally in the other ear, his language developement will not be affected - he may have issues with directional hearing if he becomes older with single sided deafness, as that is learned in the first few years of life. But this is not the usual decision as to whether your child will be able to speak at all or not.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that whenever hearing technology is involved, most medical professionals also double as sales reps who are paid provisions for every successful sale. Closing on a CI implantation easily nets a six figure sum in revenue, so you can imagine that all involved are highly motivated and perhaps not in your best interest.

Overall, it is probably the best idea to go for a second opinion. Ideally from a clinic or doctor who do not do CI implantations themselves so you can be certain that financial interests don't play as much of a role.

Once it has really been ascertained that your child has one deaf ear, then you can think whether you want a CI implant and conctact a doctor specialised in that on your own.

Do the surgery, you won’t regret it. We did genetic testing but did not change the outcome. The sooner your baby gets them, the better off they will be. We implanted our daughter at 9 months and it was the best decision we ever made (dr Roland at NYU). She is three now and her speech is incredible. It is normal to talk to people about the models you would like because that’s all apart of the internal piece of course.

I still have some hearing on one side, and the idea is to implant it on the side I have lost all hearing in before I potentially lose the hearing I have left on the other side. ",2025-04-08 12:38:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jucj3d/cochlear_implant/
1ju87k5,HearingLoss,Odd situation with temporary hearing loss.,"I have seen my doctor and he didn't really think there was a concern, but I'm concerned and debating seeing him again. Here's the details.

I was camping a couple years ago, it was not yet spring and there was some snow on the ground. I decided to take a quick dip in a small little lake that is fed by the river. I dove in and it was quite cold. I went decently deep.

When I surfaced I had basically no hearing at all in my left ear. It was not painful that I recall but very concerning obviously. After about a day my hearing came back, but it was very muffled at first, and it was accompanied with tinnitus. Eventually my hearing came back to what I was used to, but the tinnitus remains to this day. Some odd things that I've noticed are as follows.

1. When I listen to something loud, like a concert or someone yelling. It's extremely loud in my left ear, significantly louder than my right. It also buzzes kinda if the volume reaches a certain level.

2. When I swim now, I can't go down to much depth without a splitting sharp pain in my head that is unbearable. It's far worse than normal pressure discomfort, it's so bad I can't in any way force myself through it. Previously I had no issues diving or swimming at the bottom of the deep end of a pool.

3. When I exercise, pressure builds in my ears. I try yawning or blowing against plugged nostrils and it balances the pressure for a matter of seconds and then it builds again. It actually makes it hard to hear when it happens. It affects both ears, but more the left than the right.

4. My affected ear gets itchy constantly. I never had this before and it drives me crazy some days. It's just an itch that it in the ear canal. Though not deeper than about half an inch in. No signs of infection from what I can tell.

I am assuming I tore my eardrum from impact when I drove into the cold water, perhaps that would explain the bad temporary hearing loss. But I'm unsure about the ear pressure issues. I've read about eustachian tube blockage, but I thought it would not apply since I can equalize (albeit only for mere seconds) by yawning etc. after I stop exercising it eventually equalizes after 15-20 minutes or so and then I don't have further issues.

Idk, I think I need to try and see a specialist but I'm wondering if anyone has any insight or similar experiences.",2025-04-08 07:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1ju87k5/odd_situation_with_temporary_hearing_loss/

The same for me, it s genetic. I am 37 and i have hearing loss for high frequency. I will have hearing aid in the next years.
I am curious to know the genetic defect..

I have the same situation as yours, the doctor told me to get hearing aid since my situation is severe. He said that I got it genetically so there is no other solution than having hearing aids. And worse of that, if I don't get hearing aid now, when I go older it can cause me dementia. I hope we can find other solutions instead of using hearing aids.

I have a RIPOR2 gene mutation that causes DFNA21 adult onset progressive sensorineural hearing loss. I got genome sequencing done and that’s how I learned the cause.

1jsq49k,HearingLoss,Did I permanently damage my ears?,"Hey everyone, I’m really worried and need some advice. Today something really bad happened.

I was walking out of my room when I opened the door fully. I was about 10 to 13 feet away from the door (not exactly sure), when suddenly — maybe due to pressure or airflow — the door slammed shut with an insane amount of force. It was one of the loudest indoor sounds I’ve heard in my life. The slam was so loud and sharp it shocked my whole body, and my ears immediately felt pain, fullness, and pressure. One of them even feels like it has water inside or is blocked, and everything sounds slightly off since then.

What’s worrying me even more is that just yesterday:

There was a lightning strike very close by. I was indoors, but the thunder came less than a second after the flash. I felt the pressure and force in my ears.

A 1.5-liter plastic Coke bottle popped loudly about 3 feet from my head. It was sudden and sharp, and I felt it hit my ear hard. Since then, my ears were already feeling a bit weird and sensitive.


So today’s door slam happened less than 24 hours after all of that. I’m worried my ears didn’t even have time to recover, and now this latest incident might have pushed them past the point of permanent damage.

There’s no constant ringing, but there's muffled hearing, fullness, and pain. I’m also scared about head movement from the shock — not sure if I jerked, but I was startled.

Should I be this worried? Does this sound like temporary threshold shift (TTS) or something worse?



[댓글]
I think TTS is a safe bet, I don’t think the air pressure would be strong enough to cause physical injury to the ears

Echoing what another commenter said, I think you should seek therapy for what seems like severe health anxiety. I read this post and was like ""wait is this the same person?!"" and you are indeed the same person.

No :)


A door slam is not loud enough! It sounds like a gunshot doesn't it? But truth is it barely reaches 90+db (I know I've checked after having the same worries)

It sounds more like ttts as opposed to tts. Again something I can relate to! Mostly a phyclogical problem brought on and worsened by over thinking about sound!

So in a nutshell. No you haven't damaged your hearing.

Considering this is not your first post like this, I think you need see a therapist.

1jrursu,HearingLoss,Small win from Auracast / Bluetooth LE,"i have lived with hearing loss for about 20 years and got to the point i could not really watch tv with my wife.  Sure I had a tv streaming box for my hearing aids but i could never get it to work with the television audio at the same time.  So we could not watch together.

My current hearing aids are from Costco, Jabra Enhance Pro 20.  One reason i bought them was because they supported auracast which is a one to many version of bluetooth le audio.  Can work in home or imagine best in a movie theater with people using headphones or hearing aids to listen audio / alternative languages etc.

I noticed that the Jabra software for my hearing aids now also supported auracast on my iphone.

I looked on amazon and found BA210 Bluetooth Auracast transmitter for 49 dollars.   I attached to my Samsung TV, via optical connection - there are alternatives though.

Now via the Jabra app i can choose the auracast device and listen to the TV via my hearing aids, the regular speakers also play the sound so we can now both listen.

If you have auracast support and an iphone this may help you too.

[댓글]
I use auracast for different reasons not related to hearing but I'm glad it helped you, auracast is great!

Glad that Auracast worked for you. 

An Android version of the Jabra app is also available and works the same way. This means Android users with the same hearing aid and the BA210 Auracast transmitter can enjoy direct audio streaming from the TV.

In fact, other hearing aids made by GN — such as ReSound (Nexia, Savia, Vivia) and Beltone (Serene, Commerce, Envision) — will work the same way using their respective companion apps.

How did you get it to stream to HA' and sound from the TV at the same time. I can get it to stream to my HA's but no sound from the TV.

Based on your post I purchased the BA210 Bluetooth Auracast transmitter from Amazon. When I try to pair it using the Jabra Enhanced Pro 20 app it doesn't show up as an option to connect with the Auracast transmitter. Would you please provide me with instructions on how to connect it?

1jrp531,HearingLoss,Hearing loss is so frustrating,"My hearing loss is so frustrating - I can hear some people just fine, depending on their type of voice, but deep voices and accents (no offence intended) absolutely defeat me. Most of the time I just nod my head and smile, risking looking like a village idiot. I have hearing aids, but they don’t help with clarity of words, which is what I need. They just make everything loud. I am just venting here, I suppose. People who don’t have this problem don’t understand. 

[댓글]
I totally get you! I have severe hearing loss in one year and even if I got used with it, it's still frustrating at times. and my job involves lots of talking, sometimes even in noisy environments (ie on the streets).

I started wearing a badge that says ""a bit deaf, not stupid"" just to ease my life when interacting with people.

That deep voice issue (I feel you)   
My one coworker has extraaaa deep voice and I can understand the whole office except that one dude (so relieved that he's not in my dep, but I often hear him talking and don't understand shit)   
PS. I've single-sided hearing loss so my good ear helps a lot and I don't wear any aids. But when more than 3 people talk simultaneously that totally defeats me. It drives me mad and I nod and smile or if I'm not in the mood, I ignore them altogether.

I can totally feel you. I’m experiencing the same situation, it is so frustrating 🫂

I am using Jabra hearing aid and helping. Not sure which one you are using.

i feel the deeper voices so much! all the hearing comprehension tests i’ve taken have been male voices and even when i asked if they had any high pitched ones they said they didn’t. this meant i got a rlly low comprehension score. ig if someone has a hard time comprehending women’s voices it doesn’t matter as much??

Same here, depending on voices, who I can hear.  It's also how fast they talk, too.  My Mom talked fast, and I had a hard time hearing and understanding her.  She used to say to me, ""Well, that's the way I talk.""  Like not wanting to change or make it better.  I stopped wanting to converse with her. She just didn't care to make it better.

I have the same thing. I feel like all the professionals are just guessing with what's wrong. They said it MIGHT be a little hair in my ear or something. Hearing aids are just loud and electronic, doesn't clear up the words. I've been dealing with tinnitus on top of not hearing certain people. I totally get the just nod thing. Lol

I just tell people that I’m “hard of hearing” and ask them to speak up. And then they usually get embarrassed for not speaking up and do better. 

I also tell people so they can position themselves to speak into my good ear. It was awkward and embarrassing for me at first, but I’m learning to speak up. And it makes everything better for me. 

Good luck!

I feel this! I have a close family member with a low deep voice and I feel like he sometimes gets offended I can't hear him even though he knows I have a profound hearing loss. People just forget or can't relate, I guess. Also, mumblers! No chance I can understand what you are saying if you mumble (I also rely a bit on lip reading to get by)

I don't know what the 1.3 Ata is, but my good ear couldn't take the pressure so I had to have a tube put in my ear. That fixed the problem for that ear, but I had a tube for 8 months then. Hearing wasn't too good with the tube. Hearing went back to normal after the tube fell out. Before though, it was rough. My bad ear was trying to heal and get better and my good ear was compromised.

I dont have insight or anything to help you, but I have to say.... I love the hearing chart.  I wish they put those icons (piano, letters, etc) on my chart.  It shows why I have a hard time hearing words. Those different levels for the 'f' sound VS the sound of an 'e' explain a lot.

Also what is glue ear?

It looks similar to mine, except mine dips down closer to the 50s/60s in the middle. It’s called cookie bite hearing loss. I never knew I had it until my 20s, and they said it’s likely I’ve had it my whole life. So far from about age 20-35 it hasn’t gotten any worse. I have hearing aids but I don’t wear them regularly. I’ve been told that I most likely miss hearing syllables in words, but I’m able to piece them together with the sounds I can hear well. As I’ve gotten older (and lived through covid and masking) I realized that I do rely on mouth reading pretty heavily. I’ve never had a speech issue. I don’t know if my loss was lesser as a child though, I never had a hearing test when I was younger. I hope this helps!!

This is a very nice screening test.  But that's all it is.  Take your child to an ENT and have them take an actual look at your child's ear and do a complete hearing test.  This doesn't tell me if your child's hearing loss is conductive or sensineural.  Perhaps they have a bit of a cold, and their ears were stuffy.  But have them checked out.

This looks very similar to my audiogram at age 5. I’ve worn hearing aids since the first grade (I’m 41 now). Wearing them as a kid was a struggle, mostly because the technology wasn’t very good and the sounds my HAs amplified weren’t suited to my needs. It was a constant fight with my parents to wear them. When I was a teenager I stopped wearing them. Then after struggling in school and keeping a job and relationships the switch flipped and I got myself an updated pair in my twenties. It was a game changer.

I have a bilateral progressive cochlear neural hearing loss so at this point I’m moderate/severe. There are many things I have to accept that I can’t do (attend the theater, stand-up comedy shows, anything without subtitles, etc.). 

The best thing you can do after confirming this with an ENT is enroll your child in special education with a speech pathologist. Their loss is minor at this point but there sounds they aren’t hearing so those sounds will not be formed as they learn to speak. I had 8 years of speech therapy and I am forever grateful to my speech teacher who saved me from a life of “deaf speech”.  This is a personal preference because I chose to pass as a hearing person. And my comment above is offensive to some people who belong to the deaf positivity camp. I respect that, but opt to pretend to be something I’m not (a normal hearing person) even though it brings its own set of challenges. Good luck and give yourself and your child grace and patience as you navigate this.",2025-04-03 18:22:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jqpzdj/3_year_old_hearing_loss/

I can't find anything saying if it's a bad idea or not- but if I have both ears plugged then my hearing is (of course) unbalanced still- but with one plug it's somewhat balanced so I can actually hear things normally (even though my right ear actually does end up being the 'louder' one when I have one earplug on- but it depends on how deep I push it in)

It's not common to have it at your age. Aging related hearing loss is generally by 60 or older. Tho, having it bilateral makes it probable.

Unfortunately, early onset age related hearing loss can start in your 40s. although that hearing is fairly normal for someone your age, you only have measurable loss in a single frequency and perfect hearing otherwise. I wouldn't worry about it, might be that you end up needing hearing aids in your 60s or seventies.

And yes, it is entirely possible that you had a small sudden hearing loss in your right ear which regenerated. Tinnitus points to that. Not all SSNHL is so massive it immediately becomes apparent,  maybe it just was a temporary dip at 6khz which regenerated. And yes, hair cells can regenerate in the short term, its only when they are well and truly dead that this is no longer possible.

Edi: And last, I see that you actually show tow different hearing tests apparently made by different providers - yes, hearing tests can vary quitet a bit depending on how the machine is set, the operator and your daily form.  -15db variance is not unusual.

If the hearing is improving following a steroid, there may have been sudden hearing loss secondary to an autoimmune cause. It's definitely not aging-related.",2025-04-01 14:38:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jox7f4/hearing_is_recovering/
1joimln,HearingLoss,Nasal Spray causes me to hear out of tune.,"My doctor prescribed me a nasal spray called Avamys for Dust Mite Allergy.  
When I use it I get ""Glue Ear"" in my right ear and I hear notes a few frequencies below what it's supposed to be (if I compare it to my left ear.)

Now a half year later my hearing has  gotten much worse only in the right ear, and I fear that it somehow damaged the hair cells.

Have anyone ever heard of something like this?

I use Avamys (Corticoid) and it is so good for nose and alergies. But I definitely start to think about it 2 years ago when I loose 40% of my left ear. It look it affect eustachian tubes.

I’ll be receiving the hearing aids in 2 weeks once they customize them. Is there anything i need to know? 

Also, i had 3 ear surgeries when i was 9 and was told i would lose my hearing gradually when i got older. Never expected to start this young..

Hearing aids will significantly improve your quality of life. Just think about it as glasses for your ears.

I understand it can be very anxiety inducing, so if you have any specific questions, please ask.

I'll repeat myself, but it is really no different from glasses. (Started wearing my aids when I was 28)

I also have 30% loss in each ear, but mine is interesting as in one ear is 30% loss in low frequencies and the other is 30% loss in high frequencies. I can hear fine without HA but HA does help for sure, especially in noisy environments.",2025-03-31 21:45:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jof3sd/30_loss_on_each_ear/

1jo51zq,HearingLoss,Hearing imbalance,"About a month ago I had some increased hearing loss in my left ear. Two weeks ago my left phonak was adjusted but now it feels imbalanced. The left one sometimes feels too loud while the right one feels clogged and too low. (The right one wasn't adjusted) I can't handle wearing them inside anymore, only outside or in the car when it kinda feels balanced and i have to force myself to handle it in class. I find myself either wearing the left only or not wearing my hearing aids at all. Sometimes my right ear throbs after awhile when I wear the right hearing aid. 

 I should be getting new hearing aids and when I see the audiologist I'm gonna ask if they can increase the right one or decrease the left one. Any advice?

1jnvxgh,HearingLoss,Earwax buildup or something else?,"I’ve had earwax buildup for the last 2 to 3 years but recently I’ve had about 50% hearing loss from that ear Could it be related to something other than earwax? I think I had this problem in the past, which prompted me to see an ENT. he cleaned out the earwax and the hearing was fine. That was 10 years ago. I’m concerned it might be something else now. Have any of you experienced any earwax buildup and have it result in something more serious? Any chance of it resulting in total deafness? what’s the chances of that happening? Thanks.

Earwax build up doesn't cause 50 percent hearing loss. When did this happen?

You’re asking good questions for your ENT to answer.

Why not get the wax removed immediately and see?",2025-03-31 05:19:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jnvxgh/earwax_buildup_or_something_else/
1jnsy1d,HearingLoss,ENT vs audiologist to diagnose?,"I believe I damaged my ears recently. First, one day in January my new earbuds suddenly went up to full volume unintentionally. It took me a few seconds to react and pull them out. My ears hurt for several days afterward. Then in mid-March, I attended a music festival. I stood near the front for a number of concerts, wearing foam ear plugs. However, I noticed progressive pain as the festival went on, and after the final (and loudest) day, I developed very noticeable tinnitus in both ears. More than two weeks later now, it has not improved. I can't tell if my hearing has changed or not. I've been using the same volume as usual on my devices. I do often have to ask my boyfriend to repeat himself, but he has always mumbled haha. 

(I will also note, I have attended countless live music events prior to the earbud incident, and have never had tinnitus last more than a few hours afterward. I did usually wear foam earplugs, though I often didn't fully insert them. My ears had never *hurt* from sound until the earbud incident)

I would like to have a doctor evaluate me for any structural damage, and assess whether my hearing is ""normal"" or has declined. I would also like help with the tinnitus, and advice on how I can balance living my life with making sure I don't do any further damage. Should I start with an ENT or audiologist for this? I do NOT want to skip over the structural analysis and focus only on the tinnitus.

1jm5b6h,HearingLoss,Possible Treatment?,"Hello so we all know research to restore hearing is being worked on. I was able to get a hold of a medical travel company who might have found a place in Germany that does stem cell therapy to restore hearing? There was also someone who did the treatment I found on another sub and they had good results. I have not heard back from them yet but hopefully since they had it done I can talk to them about it. Does anyone else have information on this?

[댓글]
Unfortunately, there is no recognized regenerative treatment for hearing loss. ""Stem cell clinics"" that offer off label treatments in Mexico and other low regulation countries have been a thing for a while, but from what I gather they get mixed results down to being outright scams. Regenerative medicine is up and coming, but still fairly new. 

If there were currently people who successfully had their hearing restored, it would be a world sensation and turn the inventors into billionaires overnight, and you would be sure  to have heard of it already. So you can assume that anyone offering a heairng loss cure right now is a scammer or one of those doctors who just charge people to wildly inject stem cells into everything and then hope for the best with no scientific backing at all.

Is it like clinical trials? Yesterday I saw comment about a lady that was going to bring their kid to France to get gene therapy done.

1jm2biy,HearingLoss,Lost Most Left Ear Hearing for 2 Days,"My left ear suddenly went out at work. My ears have always shitty. Dozens of ear infections as a kid. Had tubes put in as well as tonsils and adenoids removed at some point. Outside of slight hearing loss and tinnitus I haven’t had a major issue since I was a teen.

I got that familiar flash bang ping and then the worst hearing loss I’ve ever had in my left ear. Despite that, I chalked it up to sinuses (despite them being completely dry) and figured it’d go away.

Next day, still no better but my right ear was compensating well so I didn’t notice it. Later that night I go to put my headphones on and the difference was insane. I could not hear any low pitched noise. I tested music on each ear individually, switched headphones to make sure it wasn’t the equipment. Yep, it sounds like my left ear is pressed to a pillow.

I immediately went to urgent care. Start feeling dizzy, as if I’m really buzzed. Nurse said it was clean, despite that they put “plugged ear” on my chart. They refer me to an ENT. I went back home and used my high-end headphones with a hearing test app (Mimi). Up to 40db hearing loss at the lower frequencies in my left ear. Obviously apps don’t compare to the real deal, but I’m still freaked out.

Morning after (this morning) I notice it’s different and my dizziness is gone. I woke up to a call that they can get me tested today. I don’t really have time to test it myself and head straight there.

I take the hearing test and my left ear is only at 15db hearing loss. It doesn’t make cutoff for medical intervention. I believe the ENT thinks I’m either a hypochondriac or it’s not as bad as I describe it so she just lets me go.

I get back home and yeah, hearing is way better. The tinnitus is worse, but I can hear. Went ahead and tested on Mimi again and it concurs.

All that to say this has happened to me before, but it’s never been this bad nor lasted this long. Should I be pushing back on the ENT or wait till it happens again?

[댓글]
You should be pushing back. This certainly was not nothing.

from what you’re saying, it sounds like it might be ménière’s disease. basically, it’s an inner ear canal disorder that can cause extreme vertigo, low pitch hearing loss, ear fullness, tinnitus, and balancing issues all while having completely clean ears. for me, i spent years going through similar things (ear fullness, sudden loss in hearing before randomly gaining it back, dizziness, balance issues, etc) before my diagnosis, at which point i had suffered permanent hearing loss. of course, im not an ent and i definitely don’t know everything you’ve gone through, but it seems like it might be worth it to check with an ent? esp if you’ve had covid at some point before all this happened cause that can be a potential trigger for it.",2025-03-28 18:43:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingLoss/comments/1jm2biy/lost_most_left_ear_hearing_for_2_days/
